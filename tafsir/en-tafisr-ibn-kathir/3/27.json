  "text": "Encouraging Gratitude\nAllah said,\nقُلْ\n(Say) O Muhammad , while praising your Lord, thanking Him, relying in all matters upon Him and trusting in Him.\nاللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ\n(O Allah! Possessor of the power) meaning, all sovereignty is Yours,\nتُؤْتِى الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ\n(You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will.) meaning, You are the Giver, You are the Taker, it is Your will that occurs and whatever You do not will, does not occur. This Ayah encourages thanking Allah for the favors He granted His Messenger and his Ummah. Allah transferred the prophethood from the Children of Israel to the Arab, Qurashi, Makkan, unlettered Prophet, the Final and Last of all Prophets and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to all mankind and Jinn. Allah endowed the Prophet with the best of qualities from the prophets before him. Allah also granted him extra qualities that no other Prophet or Messenger before him was endowed with, such as granting him (more) knowledge of Allah and His Law, knowledge of more of the matters of the past and the future, such as what will occur in the Hereafter. Allah allowed Muhammad's ﷺ Ummah to reach the eastern and western parts of the world and gave dominance to his religion and Law over all other religions and laws. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet until the Day of Judgment, and as long as the day and night succeed each other. This is why Allah said,\nقُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ\n(Say: \"O Allah! Possessor of the power,\") meaning, You decide what You will concerning Your creation and You do what you will. Allah refutes those who thought that they could decide for Allah,\nوَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ\n(And they say: \"Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Ta'if)\") 43:31.\nAllah refuted them by saying,\nأَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ\n(Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord) 43:32, meaning, \"We decide for Our creation what We will, without resistance or hindrance by anyone. We have the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all of this, and We give the prophethood to whom We will.\" Similarly, Allah said,\nاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ\n(Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) and,\nانظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ\n(See how We prefer one above another (in this world)) 17: 21\nAllah said,\nتُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى الْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ\n(You make the night enter into the day, and You make the day enter into the night) meaning, You take from the length of one of them and add it to the shortness of the other, so that they become equal, and take from the length of one of them and add it to the other so that they are not equal. This occurs throughout the seasons of the year: spring, summer, fall and winter. Allah's statement,\nوَتُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الَمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ\n(You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living.) means, You bring out the seed from the plant and the plant from the seed; the date from its seed and the date's seed from the date; the faithful from the disbeliever and the disbeliever from the faithful; the chicken from the egg and the egg from the chicken, etc.\nوَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ\n(And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.) meaning, You give whomever You will innumerable amounts of wealth while depriving others from it, out of wisdom, and justice.",
