  "text": "Shu`ayb and His People\nAllah tells us that His servant and Messenger Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, warned his people, the people of Madyan, and commanded them to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and to fear the wrath and punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. He said:\nيقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَارْجُواْ الْيَوْمَ الاٌّخِرَ\n(O my people! Worship Allah and hope for the last Day,) Ibn Jarir said: \"Some of them said that this meant: Fear the Last Day.\" This is like the Ayah,\nلِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الاٌّخِرَ\n(for those who look forward to (meeting with) Allah and the Last Day) (60:6).\nوَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ\n(and commit no mischief on the earth as mischief-makers.) This is forbidding them to make mischief on earth by spreading corruption, which means going around doing evil to people. They used to cheat in weights and measures, and ambush people on the road; this is in addition to their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. So Allah destroyed them with a mighty earthquake that convulsed their land, and the Sayhah (shout) which tore their hearts from their bodies, and the torment of the Day of Shade, when their souls were taken. This was the torment of a great day. We have already examined their story in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Hud and Surat Ash-Shu`ara'.\nفَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ\n(and they lay, prostrate in their dwellings.) Qatadah said, \"They were dead.\" Others said that they were thrown on top of one another.",
