      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\n(بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ )\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nDescribing the Qur'an and warning Those Who defy it\nPreviously we discussed the meaning of the separate letters that appear in the beginnings of some Surahs.\nكِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ\n((This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you...) Allah says, `This is a Book that We have revealed to you, O Muhammad. This `Book', is the Glorious Qur'an, the most honored Book, that Allah sent down from heaven to the most honored Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent to all the people of the earth, Arabs and non-Arabs alike,\nلِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light) We sent you, O Muhammad, with this Book in order that you might lead mankind away from misguidance and crookedness to guidance and the right way,'\nاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ الطَّـغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَـتِ\n(Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Awliya (supporters and helpers) are Taghut (false deities), they bring them out from light into darkness.) 2:257, and,\nهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant that He may bring you out from darkness into light. ) 57:9 Allah said next,\nبِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ\n(by their Lord's leave), He guides those whom He destined to be guided by the hand of His Messenger , whom He sent to guide them by His command,\nإِلَى صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ\n(to the path of the All-Mighty,) Who can never be resisted or overpowered. Rather, Allah is Irresistible above everything and everyone else,\nالْحَمِيدِ\n(the Praised.) Who is glorified and praised in all His actions, statements, legislation, commandments and prohibitions and Who only says the truth in the information He conveys. Allah's statement,\nاللَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth!), is similar to,\nقُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah - to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.) 7:158 Allah's statement,\nوَوَيْلٌ لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ\n(And woe unto the disbelievers from a severe torment. ) means, `woe to them on the Day of Judgment because they defied you, O Muhammad, and rejected you.' Allah described the disbelievers as preferring the life of the present world to the Hereafter, coveting the former life and working hard for its sake. They have forgotten the Hereafter and abandoned it behind their backs,\nوَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(and hinder (men) from the path of Allah), from following the Messengers,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek crookedness therein) they seek to make Allah's path crooked, even though it is straight itself and does not deviate on account of those who defy or betray it. When the disbelievers do this, they become engulfed in ignorance and misguidance far away from truth, and therefore, there is no hope that they will gain guidance and correctness while on this state."

      "text": "The Argument between the Prophets and the Disbelievers\nAllah narrates to us the arguments that ensued between the disbelievers and their Messengers. When their nations doubted the Message of worshipping Allah alone without partners, the Messengers said,\nأَفِى اللَّهِ شَكٌّ\n((What!) Can there be a doubt about Allah...) about His Lordship and having the exclusive right to be worshipped alone, being the only Creator of all creatures Verily, none besides Allah is worthy of worship, alone without partners with Him. Most nations were, and still are, affirming the existence of the Creator, but they call upon intermediaries besides Him whom they think will benefit them or bring them closer to Allah. Their Messengers said to them,\nيَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ\n(He calls you that He may forgive you of your sins) in the Hereafter,\nوَيُؤَخِّرْكُمْ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(and give you respite for a term appointed.), in this worldly life.

      "text": "Disbelieving Nations threaten Their Messengers with Expulsion\nAllah narrates to us how the disbelieving nations threatened their Messengers, that being, expulsion from their land and banshiment. For instance, the people of Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said to him and to those who believed in him,\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ\n(We shall certainly drive you out from our town, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you.) 7:88 The people of Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, said,\nأَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ\n(Drive out the family of Lut from your city.) 27:56 Allah said about the idolators of Quraysh,\nوَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَـفَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case they would not have stayed after you, except for a little while.)17:76 and,\nوَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ\n(And when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot. ) 8:30 Allah gave victory and aid to His Messenger after he emigrated from Makkah and gathered followers, supporters, and soldiers around him, who fought in the cause of Allah, the Exalted. Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world. Hence Allah's statement,\nفَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَوَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ\n(So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers. And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them.\") 14:13,14 Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our hosts! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious. Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21\nوَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ\n(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05\nقَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,\nذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ\n(This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,\nوَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ\n(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ\n(And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,\nاللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ\n((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,\nوَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ\n((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,\n«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,\nوَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ\n(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,\nهَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ\n(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,\nوَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ\n(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,\nيَتَجَرَّعُهُ\n(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ\n(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,\nلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا\n(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,\nوَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ\n(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,\nهَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,\nإِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,\nوَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ\n(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44\nهَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! And for the Taghun will be an evil final return. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,\nوَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46"

      "text": "Disbelieving Nations threaten Their Messengers with Expulsion\nAllah narrates to us how the disbelieving nations threatened their Messengers, that being, expulsion from their land and banshiment. For instance, the people of Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said to him and to those who believed in him,\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ\n(We shall certainly drive you out from our town, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you.) 7:88 The people of Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, said,\nأَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ\n(Drive out the family of Lut from your city.) 27:56 Allah said about the idolators of Quraysh,\nوَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَـفَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case they would not have stayed after you, except for a little while.)17:76 and,\nوَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ\n(And when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot. ) 8:30 Allah gave victory and aid to His Messenger after he emigrated from Makkah and gathered followers, supporters, and soldiers around him, who fought in the cause of Allah, the Exalted. Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world. Hence Allah's statement,\nفَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَوَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ\n(So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers. And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them.\") 14:13,14 Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our hosts! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious. Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21\nوَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ\n(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05\nقَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,\nذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ\n(This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,\nوَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ\n(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ\n(And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,\nاللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ\n((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,\nوَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ\n((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,\n«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,\nوَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ\n(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,\nهَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ\n(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,\nوَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ\n(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,\nيَتَجَرَّعُهُ\n(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ\n(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,\nلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا\n(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,\nوَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ\n(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,\nهَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,\nإِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,\nوَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ\n(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44\nهَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so!

And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,\nوَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46"

Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21\nوَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ\n(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05\nقَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,\nذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ\n(This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,\nوَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ\n(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ\n(And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,\nاللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ\n((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,\nوَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ\n((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,\n«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,\nوَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ\n(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,\nهَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ\n(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,\nوَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ\n(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,\nيَتَجَرَّعُهُ\n(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ\n(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,\nلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا\n(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,\nوَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ\n(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,\nهَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,\nإِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,\nوَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ\n(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44\nهَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! And for the Taghun will be an evil final return. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,\nوَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46"

      "text": "Disbelieving Nations threaten Their Messengers with Expulsion\nAllah narrates to us how the disbelieving nations threatened their Messengers, that being, expulsion from their land and banshiment. For instance, the people of Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said to him and to those who believed in him,\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ\n(We shall certainly drive you out from our town, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you.) 7:88 The people of Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, said,\nأَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ\n(Drive out the family of Lut from your city.) 27:56 Allah said about the idolators of Quraysh,\nوَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَـفَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case they would not have stayed after you, except for a little while.)17:76 and,\nوَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ\n(And when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot. ) 8:30 Allah gave victory and aid to His Messenger after he emigrated from Makkah and gathered followers, supporters, and soldiers around him, who fought in the cause of Allah, the Exalted. Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world. Hence Allah's statement,\nفَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَوَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ\n(So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers. And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them.\") 14:13,14 Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our hosts! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious. Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21\nوَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ\n(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05\nقَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,\nذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ\n(This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,\nوَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ\n(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ\n(And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,\nاللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ\n((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,\nوَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ\n((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,\n«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,\nوَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ\n(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,\nهَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ\n(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,\nوَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ\n(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,\nيَتَجَرَّعُهُ\n(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ\n(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,\nلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا\n(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,\nوَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ\n(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,\nهَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,\nإِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,\nوَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ\n(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44\nهَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! And for the Taghun will be an evil final return. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,\nوَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46"

      "text": "Disbelieving Nations threaten Their Messengers with Expulsion\nAllah narrates to us how the disbelieving nations threatened their Messengers, that being, expulsion from their land and banshiment. For instance, the people of Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said to him and to those who believed in him,\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ\n(We shall certainly drive you out from our town, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you.) 7:88 The people of Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, said,\nأَخْرِجُواْ ءَالَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ\n(Drive out the family of Lut from your city.) 27:56 Allah said about the idolators of Quraysh,\nوَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذًا لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَـفَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case they would not have stayed after you, except for a little while.)17:76 and,\nوَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ\n(And when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot. ) 8:30 Allah gave victory and aid to His Messenger after he emigrated from Makkah and gathered followers, supporters, and soldiers around him, who fought in the cause of Allah, the Exalted. Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world. Hence Allah's statement,\nفَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَوَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ\n(So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers. And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them.\") 14:13,14 Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our hosts! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious. Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.\")58:21\nوَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ\n(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr.) 21:05\nقَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Musa said to his people: \"Seek help in Allah and be patient. Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants: and the (blessed) end is for the those who have Taqwa.\")7:128 and,\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)7:137 Allah said next,\nذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِى وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ\n(This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat. ) this warning is for he who fears standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection and fears His warnings and torment. Allah said in other instances,\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, verily, his abode will be Hellfire. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.)79:37-41 and,\nوَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ\n(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.)55:46 Allah said next,\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ\n(And they sought victory and help) refers to the Messengers who sought the help and victory of their Lord over their nations, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah refers to the nations, invoking Allah's victory against themselves! Some idolators said,\nاللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ\n((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,\nوَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ\n((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,\n«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,\nوَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ\n(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,\nهَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ\n(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,\nوَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ\n(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,\nيَتَجَرَّعُهُ\n(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ\n(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,\nلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا\n(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,\nوَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ\n(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,\nوَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ\n(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,\nهَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,\nإِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50,\nوَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ\n(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44\nهَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ\n(This is so! And for the Taghun will be an evil final return. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:55-58 There are many other similar Ayat that indicate that the punishment they will receive is of different kinds, and that it is repeated in various types and forms that only Allah the Exalted knows, as just recompense,\nوَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.) 41:46"

      "text": "A Parable for the Deeds of the Disbelievers\nThis is a parable that Allah has given for the deeds and actions of the disbelievers who worshipped others besides Him and rejected His Messengers, thus building their acts on groundless basis. Their actions vanished from them when they were most in need of their rewards. Allah said,\nمَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ\n(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works) on the Day of Judgment, when they will seek their rewards from Allah the Exalted. They used to think that they had something, but they will find nothing, except what remains of ashes when a strong wind blows on it,\nفِي يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ\n(on a stormy day;) They will not earn rewards for any of the good works they performed during this life, except what they can preserve of ashes during a day of strong wind. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً\n(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.)25:23,\nمَثَلُ مَا يُنْفِقُونَ فِى هِـذِهِ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَثَلِ رِيحٍ فِيهَا صِرٌّ أَصَابَتْ حَرْثَ قَوْمٍ ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَتْهُ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ اللَّهُ وَلَـكِنْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ\n(The parable of what they spend in this world is that of a wind which is extremely cold; it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it.

Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His parable is that of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.)2:264 Allah said in this Ayah,\nذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلاَلُ الْبَعِيدُ\n(That is the straying, far away from the right path) meaning, their work and deeds were not based on firm, correct grounds, and thus, they lost their rewards when they needed them the most,\nذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلاَلُ الْبَعِيدُ\n(That is the straying, far away from the right path.)"

Allah says, `This is a Book that We have revealed to you, O Muhammad. This `Book', is the Glorious Qur'an, the most honored Book, that Allah sent down from heaven to the most honored Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent to all the people of the earth, Arabs and non-Arabs alike,\nلِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light) We sent you, O Muhammad, with this Book in order that you might lead mankind away from misguidance and crookedness to guidance and the right way,'\nاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ الطَّـغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَـتِ\n(Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Awliya (supporters and helpers) are Taghut (false deities), they bring them out from light into darkness.) 2:257, and,\nهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant that He may bring you out from darkness into light. ) 57:9 Allah said next,\nبِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ\n(by their Lord's leave), He guides those whom He destined to be guided by the hand of His Messenger , whom He sent to guide them by His command,\nإِلَى صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ\n(to the path of the All-Mighty,) Who can never be resisted or overpowered. Rather, Allah is Irresistible above everything and everyone else,\nالْحَمِيدِ\n(the Praised.) Who is glorified and praised in all His actions, statements, legislation, commandments and prohibitions and Who only says the truth in the information He conveys. Allah's statement,\nاللَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth!), is similar to,\nقُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah - to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.) 7:158 Allah's statement,\nوَوَيْلٌ لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ\n(And woe unto the disbelievers from a severe torment. ) means, `woe to them on the Day of Judgment because they defied you, O Muhammad, and rejected you.' Allah described the disbelievers as preferring the life of the present world to the Hereafter, coveting the former life and working hard for its sake. They have forgotten the Hereafter and abandoned it behind their backs,\nوَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(and hinder (men) from the path of Allah), from following the Messengers,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek crookedness therein) they seek to make Allah's path crooked, even though it is straight itself and does not deviate on account of those who defy or betray it. When the disbelievers do this, they become engulfed in ignorance and misguidance far away from truth, and therefore, there is no hope that they will gain guidance and correctness while on this state."

      "text": "Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ\n`(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.) by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah's promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.' Allah said in another Ayah,\nيَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً\n(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.) 4:120\nوَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ\n(I had no authority over you) Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,\nإِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى\n(except that I called you, and you responded to me.) even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,\nفَلاَ تَلُومُونِى\n(So blame me not,) today,\nوَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ\n(but blame yourselves.), because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.' Shaytan will say next,\nمَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ\n(I cannot help you), I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,\nوَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِىَّ\n(nor can you help me.), nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,\nإِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ\n(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.) or because you associated me with Allah before,' according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; \"I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\" This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:5-6 and,\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)19:82 Allah said next,\nإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Verily, the wrongdoers), who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment.

      "text": "Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ\n`(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.) by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah's promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.' Allah said in another Ayah,\nيَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً\n(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.) 4:120\nوَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ\n(I had no authority over you) Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,\nإِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى\n(except that I called you, and you responded to me.) even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,\nفَلاَ تَلُومُونِى\n(So blame me not,) today,\nوَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ\n(but blame yourselves.), because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.' Shaytan will say next,\nمَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ\n(I cannot help you), I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,\nوَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِىَّ\n(nor can you help me.), nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,\nإِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ\n(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.) or because you associated me with Allah before,' according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; \"I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\" This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:5-6 and,\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)19:82 Allah said next,\nإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Verily, the wrongdoers), who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people.

Similar is said by Ad-Dahhak, Sa'id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid and several others. They stated that this parable describes the believer's deeds, good statements and good actions. The believer is just like the beneficial date tree, always having good actions ascending at all times, by day and by night. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he asked,\n«أَخْبِرُونِي عَنْ شَجَرَةٍ تُشْبِهُ أَوْ كَالرَّجُلِ الْمُسْلِمِ لَا يَتَحَاتُّ وَرَقُهَا صَيْفًا وَلَا شِتَاءً، وَتُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا»\n(Tell me about a tree that resembles the Muslim, the leaves of which do not fall in summer or winter and gives its fruit at all times by the leave of its Lord.)\" Ibn `Umar said, \"I thought of the date palm tree, but felt shy to answer when I saw that Abu Bakr and `Umar did not talk. When they did not give an answer, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«هِيَ النَّخْلَة»\n(It is the date palm tree.) When we departed, I said to `Umar, `My father, by Allah! I thought that it was the date tree.' He said, `Why did you not speak then' I said, `I saw you were silent and I felt shy to say anything.' `Umar said, `Had you said it, it would have been more precious to me than such things (i.e., would have been very precious to me).\"' `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,\nكَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ\n(as a goodly tree), is a tree in Paradise. Allah said next,\nتُؤْتِى أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ\n(Giving its fruit at all times,) It is said that it means by day and by night. And they say that describes the believer as a tree that always has fruits during summer and winter, by night and by day. This is the parable of the believer whose good works ascend to heaven by day and by night and at all times,\nبِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا\n(by the leave of its Lord, ) thus earning perfection and becoming beneficial, plentiful, pure and blessed,\nوَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ\n(and Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember.) Allah said next,\nوَمَثلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ\n(And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree) describing the disbelief of the disbeliever, for it has no basis or stability. It is similar to the colocynth tree (a very bitter, unscented plant) which is also called, `Ash-Shiryan'. Shu`bah narrated that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Qurrah narrated that Anas bin Malik said that it is the colocynth tree. Allah said,\nاجْتُثَّتْ\n(uprooted), meaning, was cutoff from the root,\nمِن فَوْقِ الاٌّرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِن قَرَارٍ\n(from the surface of earth, having no stability.) therefore, existing without basis or stabililty, just like Kufr (disbelief), for it does not have a basis or roots.

He said next,\n«إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ الْمُؤْمِنَ إِذَا كَانَ فِي انْقِطَاعٍ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَإقْبَالٍ مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ، نَزَل إِلَيْهِ مَلَائِكَةٌ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِيضُ الْوُجُوهِ، كَأَنَّ وُجُوهَهُمُ الشَّمْسُ، مَعَهُمْ كَفَنٌ مِنَ أَكْفَانِ الْجَنَّةِ،وَحَنُوطٌ مِنْ حَنُوطِ الْجَنَّةِ، حَتَّى يَجْلِسُوا مِنْهُ مَدَّ الْبَصَرِ، ثُمَّ يَجِيءُ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ حَتَّى يَجْلِسَ عِنْدَ رَأْسِهِ، فَيَقُولُ: أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الطَّيِّبَةُ اخْرُجِي إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنَ اللهِ وَرِضْوَانٍ قَالَ : فَتَخْرُجُ تَسِيلُ، كَمَا تَسِيلُ الْقَطْرَةُ مِنْ فِي السِّقَاءِ، فَيَأْخُذُهَا، فَإِذَا أَخَذَهَا لَمْ يَدَعُوهَا فِي يَدِهِ طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ حَتَّى يَأْخُذُوهَا فَيَجْعَلُوهَا فِي ذَلِكَ الْكَفَنِ وَفِي ذَلِكَ الْحَنُوطِ، وَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا كَأَطْيَبِ نَفْحَةِ مِسْكٍ وُجِدَتْ عَلَى وَجْهِ الْأَرْضِ، فَيَصْعَدُونَ بِهَا فَلَا يَمُرُّونَ بِهَا، يَعْنِي عَلَى مَلَأٍ مِنَ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، إِلَّا قَالُوا: مَا هَذِهِ الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: فُلَانُ بْنُ فُلَانٍ بِأَحْسَنِ أَسْمَائِهِ الَّتِي كَانُوا يُسَمُّونَهُ بِهَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَتَّى يَنْتَهُوا بِهِ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا فَيَسْتَفْتِحُونَ لَهُ، فَيُفْتَحُ لَهُ فَيُشَيِّعُهُ مِنْ كُلِّ سَمَاءٍ مُقَرَّبُوهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الَّتِي تَلِيهَا، حَتَّى يُنْتَهَى بِهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ السَّابِعَةِ، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ: اكْتُبُوا كِتَابَ عَبْدِي فِي عِلِّيِّينَ وَأَعِيدُوهُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَإِنِّي مِنْهَا خَلَقْتُهُمْ وَفِيهَا أُعِيدُهُمْ، وَمِنْهَا أُخْرِجُهُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَى، قَالَ: فَتُعَادُ رُوحُهُ فِي جَسَدِهِ، فَيَأْتِيهِ مَلَكَانِ فَيُجْلِسَانِهِ فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّي اللهُ، فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَا دِينُكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: دِينِي الْإِسْلَامُ، فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَا هَذَا الرَّجُلُ الَّذِي بُعِثَ فِيكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُ: هُوَ رَسُولُ اللهِ، فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: وَمَا عِلْمُكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: قَرَأْتُ كِتَابَ اللهِ فَآمَنْتُ بِهِ وَصَدَّقْتُ، فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ: أَنْ صَدَقَ عَبْدِي فَأَفْرِشُوهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَأَلْبِسُوهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَافْتَحُوا لَهُ بَابًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ قَالَ : فَيَأْتِيهِ مِنْ رَوْحِهَا وَطِيبِهَا وَيُفْسَحُ لَهُ فِي قَبْرِهِ مَدَّ بَصَرِهِ وَيَأْتِيهِ رَجُلٌ حَسَنُ الْوَجْهِ، حَسَنُ الثِّيَابِ، طَيِّبُ الرِّيحِ، فَيَقُولُ: أَبْشِرْ بِالَّذِي يَسُرُّكَ، هَذَا يَوْمُكَ الَّذِي كُنْتَ تُوعَدُ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ:مَنْ أَنْتَ فَوَجْهُكَ الْوَجْهُ الَّذِي يَأْتِي بِالْخَيْرِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَنَا عَمَلُكَ الصَّالِحُ، فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ أَقِم السَّاعَةَ رَبِّ أَقِمِ السَّاعَةَ، حَتَّى أَرْجِعَ إِلَى أَهْلِي وَمَالِي.\n(When a believing slave is reaching the end of his term in the life of this world and the beginning of his term in the Hereafter, a group of angels, whose faces are white and as radiant as the sun, will descend onto him from heaven. They will carry with them white shroud from Paradise, and fragrance for enshrouding from Paradise. They will sit as far from him as the sight goes. Then, the angel of death, will come until he sits right next to his head, saying, \"O, good and pure soul! Depart (your body) to Allah's forgiveness and pleasure.\" So the soul flows (out of its body), just as the drop flows out from the tip of the jug, and the angel of death captures it. When he captures the soul, they (the group of angels) will not leave it with him for more than an instance, and they will seize it and wrap it in that shroud, and in that fragrance. A most pleasant musk scent ever found on the earth, will flow out of the soul, and the angels will ascend it (to heaven). They will not pass by, but they will say, \"Whose is this Tayyib (good) soul\" They (the angels who are ascending the soul) will reply, \"Such person, the son of such and such person,\" -- calling him by the best names that he used to be called in the world. They will reach the lower heaven and will ask that its door be opened for him, and it will be opened for them. The best residents of every heaven will then see him to the next heaven, until he is brought to the seventh heaven. Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, will say, \"List my servants record in `Illiyyin and send him back to earth, for I have created them from it, and into it I shall return them, and from it I shall bring them out once again.\" The soul will be joined with its body, and two angels will come to him, sit him up and ask him, \"Who is your Lord\" He will say, \"Allah is my Lord.\" They will ask him, \"What is your religion\" He will say, \"My religion is Islam.\" They will say to him, \"What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) who was sent to you\" He will say, \"He is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.\" They will ask him, \"And what proof do you have about it\" He will say, \"I read the Book of Allah (the Qur'an), and had faith and belief in him.\" Then, a caller (Allah) will herald from heaven, \"My servant has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him from Paradise, and let him wear from (the clothes of) Paradise, and open a door for him to Paradise.\" So he is given from Paradise's tranquillity and good scent, and his grave will be expanded for him as far as his sight can reach. Then, a man, with a handsome face and handsome clothes and whose scent is pleasant, will come to him, saying, \"Receive the glad tidings with that which pleases you. This is the Day which you were promised.\" He will ask him, \"Who are you; for yours is the face that carries the good news\" He will reply, \"I am your good works.\" He will say, \"O Lord! Hurry up with the commencement of the Hour, hurry up with the commencement of the Hour, so I can return to my family and my wealth.\")\nقَالَ: وَإِنَّ الْعَبْدَ الْكَافِرَ إِذَا كَانَ فِي انْقِطَاعٍ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَإِقْبَالٍ مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ، نَزَلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَائِكَةٌ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ سُودُ الْوُجُوهِ مَعَهُمُ الْمُسُوحُ، فَجَلَسُوا مِنْهُ مَدَّ الْبَصَرِ، ثُمَّ يَجِيءُ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ فَيَجْلِسَ عِنْدَ رَأْسِهِ، فَيَقُولُ: أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْخَبِيثَةُ، اخْرُجِي إِلَى سَخَطٍ مِنَ اللهِ وَغَضَبٍ قَالَ: فَتَفَرَّقَ فِي جَسَدِهِ فَيَنْتَزِعُهَا كَمَا يُنْتَزَعُ السَّفُّودُ مِنَ الصُّوفِ الْمَبْلُولِ، فَيَأْخُذُهَا فَإِذَا أَخَذَهَا لَمْ يَدَعُوهَا فِي يَدِهِ طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ حَتَّى يَجْعَلُوهَا فِي تِلْكَ الْمُسُوحِ،فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا كَأَنْتَنِ رِيحِ جِيفَةٍ وُجِدَتْ عَلَى وَجْهِ الْأَرْضِ، فَيَصْعَدُونَ بِهَا، فَلَا يَمُرُّونَ بِهَا عَلَى مَلَأٍ مِنَ الْمَلَائِكَةِ إِلَّا قَالُوا: مَا هَذِهِ الرُّوحُ الْخَبِيثَةُ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: فُلَانُ بْنُ فُلَانٍ بِأَقْبَحِ أَسْمَائِهِ الَّتِي كَانَ يُسَمَّى بِهَا فِي الدُّنْيَا، حَتَّى يُنْتَهَى بِهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا، فَيُسْتَفْتَحُ لَهُ فَلَا يُفْتَحُ لَهُ ثُمَّ قَرَأَ رَسُولُ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم:\nلاَ تُفَتَّحُ لَهُمْ أَبْوَبُ السَّمَآءِ وَلاَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ حَتَّى يَلِجَ الْجَمَلُ فِى سَمِّ الْخِيَاطِ\nفَيَقُولُ اللهُ: اكْتُبُوا كِتَابَهُ فِي سِجِّينٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ السُّفْلَى، فَتُطْرَحُ رُوحُهُ طَرْحًا ثُمَّ قَرَأَ\nوَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِى بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِى مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ\nفَتُعَادُ رُوحُهُ فِي جَسَدِهِ، وَيَأْتِيهِ مَلَكَانِ فَيُجْلِسَانِهِ وَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: هَاهْ هَاهْ لَا أَدْرِي، فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَا دِينُكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: هَاهْ هَاهْ لَا أَدْرِي، فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَا هَذَا الرَّجُلُ الَّذِي بُعِثَ فِيكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُ: هَاهْ هَاهْ لَا أَدْرِي، فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ: أَنْ كَذَبَ عَبْدِي فَأَفْرِشُوهُ مِنَ النَّارِ، وَافْتَحُوا لَهُ بَابًا إِلَى النَّارِ، فَيَأْتِيهِ مِنْ حَرِّهَا وَسَمُومِهَا، وَيَضِيقُ عَلَيْهِ قَبْرُهُ حَتَّى تَخْتَلِفَ فِيهِ أَضْلَاعُهُ، وَيَأْتِيهِ رَجُلٌ قَبِيحُ الْوَجْهِ، قَبِيحُ الثِّيَابِ، مُنْتِنُ الرِّيحِ، فَيَقُولُ: أَبْشِرْ بِالَّذِي يَسُوؤُكَ، هَذَا يَوْمُكَ الَّذِي كُنْتَ تُوعَدُ، فَيَقُولُ: وَمَنْ أَنْتَ، فَوَجْهُكَ الْوَجْهُ يَجِيءُ بِالشَّرِّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَنَا عَمَلُكَ الْخَبِيثُ، فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ لَا تُقِمِ السَّاعَة»\n(And when the disbelieving person is reaching the end of his term in the world and the beginning of his term in the Hereafter, there will descend onto him from heaven angels with dark faces. They will bring with them Musuh, and will sit as far from him as the sight reaches. Then the angel of death will come forward and sit right next to his head, saying, \"O impure, evil soul! Depart (your body) to the anger of Allah and a wrath from Him.\" The soul will scatter throughout his body, and the angel of death will seize it as when the thorny branch is removed from wet wool. The angel of death will seize the soul, and when he does, they (the group of angels) will not let it stay in his hand for more than an instance, and they will wrap it in the Musuh. The most putrid smell a dead corpse can ever have on earth will emit from the soul, and the angels will ascend with it. Whenever they pass by a group of angels, they will ask, \"Whose is this evil soul\" The angels will respond, \"He is such person son of such person,\" -- calling him by the worst names he was known by in the world. When they reach the lowest heaven, they will request that its door be opened for him, and their request will be denied. \"For them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle.\" 7:40 Allah will declare, \"List his record in Sijjin in the lowest earth.\" The wicked soul will then be thrown from heaven. \"And whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far off place.\"22:31 His soul will be returned to his body, and two angels will come to him, sit him up and ask him, \"Who is your Lord\" He will say, \"Oh, oh! I do not know.\" They will ask him, \"What is your religion\", and he will say, \"Oh, oh! I do not know.\" They will ask him, \"What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) who was sent to you\" He will say, \"Oh, oh, I do not know!\" A caller (Allah) will herald from heaven, \"My servant has lied, so furnish him with the Fire and open a door for him to the Fire.\" He will find its heat and fierce hot wind. And his grave will be reduced in size, until his bones crush each other. Then, a man with a dreadful face, wearing dreadful clothes and with a disgusting smell emitting from him will come to him, saying, \"Receive the glad tidings with that which will displease you! This is the Day that you have been promised.\" He will ask that man, \"And who are you, for yours is the face that brings about evil\" He will say, \"I am your evil work.\" He will therefore cry, \"O, my Lord! Do not commence the Hour!\") Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. In his Musnad, Imam `Abd bin Humayd recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ إِذَا وُضِعَ فِي قَبْرِهِ، وَتَوَلَّى عَنْهُ أَصْحَابُهُ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيَسْمَعُ قَرْعَ نِعَالِهِمْ، فَيَأْتِيهِ مَلَكَانِ فَيُقْعِدَانِهِ فَيَقُولَانِ لَهُ: مَا كُنْتَ تَقُولُ فِي هَذَا الرَّجُلِ؟ قَالَ: فَأَمَّا الْمُؤْمِنُ فَيَقُولُ: أَشْهَدُ أَنَّهُ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ، قَالَ: فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: انْظُرْ إِلَى مَقْعَدِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ قَدْ أَبْدَلَكَ اللهُ بِهِ مَقْعَدًا مِنَ الْجَنَّة»\n(Verily, when the servant is placed in his grave and his friends (or family) depart, as he hears the sound of their shoes, two angels will come to him. They will sit him up and ask him, `What do you say about this man (Muhammad ﷺ)' As for the believer, he will say, `I bear witness that He is Allah's servant and Messenger.' He will be told, `Look at your seat in the Fire, Allah has replaced it for you with a seat in Paradise.') The Prophet said next,\n«فَيَرَاهُمَا جَمِيعًا»\n(So he will see both seats. ) Qatadah added, \"We were told that his grave will be enlarged up to seventy forearms length and will be filled with greenery for him until the Day of Judgement.\" Muslim collected this Hadith also from `Abd bin Humayd, while An-Nasa'i collected it from Yunus bin Muhammad bin Al-Mu'addah. Al-Hafiz Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, may Allah grant him mercy, recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا قُبِرَ الْمَيِّتُ أَوْ قَالَ: أَحَدُكُمْ أَتَاهُ مَلَكَانِ أَسْوَدَانِ أَزْرَقَانِ، يُقَالُ لِأَحَدِهِمَا مُنْكَرٌ وَالْآخَرِ نَكِيرٌ، فَيَقُولَانِ: مَا كُنْتَ تَقُولُ فِي هَذَا الرَّجُلِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مَا كَانَ يَقُولُ هُوَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، فَيَقُولَانِ: قَدْ كُنَّا نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُولُ هَذَا، ثُمَّ يُفْسَحُ لَهُ فِي قَبْرِهِ سَبْعُونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي سَبْعِينَ، وَيُنَوَّرُ لَهُ فِيهِ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ: نَمْ، فَيَقُولُ: أَرْجِعُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَأُخْبِرُهُمْ، فَيَقُولَانِ: نَمْ نَوْمَةَ الْعَرُوسِ الَّذِي لَا يُوقِظُهُ إِلَّا أَحَبُّ أَهْلِهِ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَبْعَثَهُ اللهُ مِنْ مَضْجَعِهِ ذَلِكَ، وَإِنْ كَانَ مُنَافِقًا قَالَ: سَمِعْتُ النَّاسَ يَقُولُونَ: فَقُلْتُ مِثْلَهُمْ لَا أَدْرِي، فَيَقُولَانِ: قَدْ كُنَّا نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُولُ هَذَا، فَيُقَالُ لِلْأَرْضِ: الْتَئِمِي عَلَيْهِ فَتَلْتَئِمُ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى تَخْتَلِفَ أَضْلَاعُهُ، فَلَا يَزَالُ فِيهَا مُعَذَّبًا حَتَّى يَبْعَثَهُ اللهُ مِنْ مَضْجَعِهِ ذَلِك»\n(When the dead - or one of you - is buried, two dark and blue angels will come to him; one is called `Munkir' and the other is called `Nakir'. They will ask him, `What did you say about this man (Muhammad ﷺ)' He will reply, `What he used to say, that he is Allah's servant and Messenger. I bear witness that there is no true deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.' They will say, `We know that you used to say that,' and his grave will be made larger for him to seventy forearms length by seventy forearms length and will be filled with light for him. He will be told, `Sleep,' but he will reply, `Let me go back to my family in order that I tell them.' They will say, `Sleep, just like the bridegroom who is awakened by the dearest of his family, until Allah resurrects him from that sleep.' If he was a hypocrite, his answer will be, `I do not know! I heard people say something, so I used to repeat what they were saying.' They will say, `We know that you used to say that.' The earth will be commanded, `Come closer all around him,' and it will come closer to him until his ribs cross each other. He will remain in this torment, until Allah resurrects him from his sleep.) At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan, Gharib.\" Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\nيُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter.)\nذَلِكَ إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ فِي الْقَبْرِ مَنْ رَبُّكَ، وَمَا دِينُكَ، وَمَنْ نَبِيُّكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّيَ اللهُ، وَدِينِي الْإِسْلَامُ، وَنَبِيِّي مُحَمَّدٌ جَاءَنَا بِالبَيِّنَاتِ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللهِ، فَآمَنْتُ بِهِ وَصَدَّقْتُ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: صَدَقْتَ، عَلَى هَذَا عِشْتَ، وَعَلَيْهِ مِتَّ، وَعَلَيْهِ تُبْعَث»\n(When he will be asked in the grave, `Who is your Lord What is your religion Who is your Prophet' He will reply, `Allah is my Lord, Islam is my religion and Muhammad is my Prophet who brought the clear proofs from Allah. I believed in him and had faith in him.' He will be told, `You have said the truth; you have lived on this, died on it and will be resurrected on it.') Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، إِنَّ الْمَيِّتَ لَيَسْمَعُ خَفْقَ نِعَالِكُمْ حِينَ تُوَلُّونَ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ، فَإِنْ كَانَ مُؤْمِنًا كَانَتِ الصَّلَاةُ عِنْدَ رَأْسِهِ وَالزَّكَاةُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ وَالصَّوْمُ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ وَكَانَ فِعْلُ الْخَيْرَاتِ مِنَ الصَّدَقَةِ وَالصِّلَةِ وَالْمَعْرُوفِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ إِلَى النَّاسِ عِنْدَ رِجْلَيْهِ، فَيُؤْتَى مِنْ قِبَلِ رَأْسِهِ، فَتَقُولُ الصَّلَاةُ: مَا قِبَلِي مَدْخَلٌ، فَيُؤْتَى عَنْ يَمِينِهِ فَتَقُولُ الزَّكَاةُ: مَا قِبَلِي مَدْخَلٌ، فَيُؤْتَى عَنْ يَسَارِهِ فَيَقُولُ الصِّيَامُ: مَا قِبَلِي مَدْخَلٌ، فَيُؤْتَى عِنْدَ رِجْلَيْهِ فَيَقُولُ فِعْلُ الْخَيْرَاتِ : مَا قِبَلِي مَدْخَلٌ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: اجْلِسْ، فَيَجْلِسُ قَدْ مَثُلَتْ لَهُ الشَّمْسُ قَدْ دَنَتْ لِلْغُرُوبِ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: أَخْبِرْنَا عَمَّا نَسْأَلُكَ، فَيَقُولُ: دَعْنِي حَتَّى أُصَلِّيَ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: إِنَّكَ سَتَفْعَلُ، فَأَخْبِرْنَا عَمَّا نَسْأَلُكَ، فَيَقُولُ: وَعَمَّ تَسْأَلُونِي؟ فَيُقَالُ: أَرَأَيْتَ هَذَا الرَّجُلَ الَّذِي كَانَ فِيكُمْ مَاذَا تَقُولُ بِهِ، وَمَاذَا تَشْهَدُ بِهِ عَلَيْهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَمُحَمَّدٌ؟ فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: نَعَمْ، فَيَقُولُ: أَشْهَدُ أَنَّهُ رَسُولُ اللهِ، وَأَنَّه جَاءَنَا بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللهِ فَصَدَّقْنَاهُ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: عَلَى ذَلِكَ حَيِيتَ وَعَلَى ذَلِكَ مِتَّ، وَعَلَيْهِ تُبْعَثُ إِنْ شَاءَ اللهُ، ثُمَّ يُفْسَحُ لَهُ فِي قَبْرِهِ سَبْعُونَ ذِرَاعًا وَيُنَوَّرُ لَهُ فِيهِ، وَيُفْتَحُ لَهُ بَابٌ إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: انْظُرْ إِلَى مَا أَعَدَّ اللهُ لَكَ فِيهَا، فَيَزْدَادُ غِبْطَةً وَسُرُورًا،ثُمَّ تُجْعَلُ نَسَمَتُهُ فِي النَّسَمِ الطَّيِّبِ، وَهِيَ طَيْرٌ خُضْرٌ تَعْلُقُ بِشَجَرِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَيُعَادُ الْجَسَدُ إِلَى مَا بُدِىءَ مِنَ التُّرَاب»\n(By He Who owns my life! The dead person hears the sound of your slippers (or shoes) when you depart and leave him. If he is a believer, the prayer will stand by his head, Zakah to his right and the fast by his left; the righteous deeds, such as charity, keeping relations with kith and kin and acts of kindness to people will stand by his feet. He will be approached from his head, and the prayer will declare, `No entrance from my side.' He will be approached from his right, and Zakah will declare, `There is no entrance from my side.' He will be approached from his left, and the fast will declare, `There is no entrance from my side.' He will be approached from his feet, and the acts of righteousness will declare, `There is no entrance from our side.' He will be commanded to sit up, and he will sit up while the sun appears to him just like when it is about to set. He will be told, `Tell us about what we are going to ask you.' He will say, `Leave me until I pray.' He will be told, `You will pray, but first tell us what we want to know.' He will ask, `What are your questions' He will be told, `This man who was sent among you, what do you say about him and what is your testimony about him' He will ask, `Muhammad ﷺ' He will be answered in the positive and he will reply, `I bear witness that he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and that he has brought us the proofs from our Lord. We believed in him.' He will be told, `This is the way you lived and died and Allah willing, you will be resurrected on it.' His grave will be made wider for him seventy forearms length, and it will be filled with light. A door will also be opened for him to Paradise. He will be told, `Look at what Allah has prepared for you in it.' He will increase in joy and delight and then his soul will be placed with the pure souls, inside green birds eating from the trees of Paradise. The body will be returned to its origin, dust. So Allah said, o\nيُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter.)) Ibn Hibban collected this Hadith, and his narration added the disbeliever's answer and his torment. `Abdur-Razzaq recor- ded that Tawus said,\nيُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا\n(Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world,) is in reference to La ilaha ilallah, while,\nوَفِي الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(and in the Hereafter) is in reference to the questioning in the grave. Qatadah commented, \"As for this life, Allah will make them firm on the way of righteous- ness and good deeds,\nوَفِي الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(and in the Hereafter.) in the grave.\" Several others among the Salaf said the same."

This `Book', is the Glorious Qur'an, the most honored Book, that Allah sent down from heaven to the most honored Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent to all the people of the earth, Arabs and non-Arabs alike,\nلِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light) We sent you, O Muhammad, with this Book in order that you might lead mankind away from misguidance and crookedness to guidance and the right way,'\nاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ الطَّـغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَـتِ\n(Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Awliya (supporters and helpers) are Taghut (false deities), they bring them out from light into darkness.) 2:257, and,\nهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant that He may bring you out from darkness into light. ) 57:9 Allah said next,\nبِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ\n(by their Lord's leave), He guides those whom He destined to be guided by the hand of His Messenger , whom He sent to guide them by His command,\nإِلَى صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ\n(to the path of the All-Mighty,) Who can never be resisted or overpowered. Rather, Allah is Irresistible above everything and everyone else,\nالْحَمِيدِ\n(the Praised.) Who is glorified and praised in all His actions, statements, legislation, commandments and prohibitions and Who only says the truth in the information He conveys. Allah's statement,\nاللَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth!), is similar to,\nقُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Say: \"O mankind!

Allah described the disbelievers as preferring the life of the present world to the Hereafter, coveting the former life and working hard for its sake. They have forgotten the Hereafter and abandoned it behind their backs,\nوَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(and hinder (men) from the path of Allah), from following the Messengers,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek crookedness therein) they seek to make Allah's path crooked, even though it is straight itself and does not deviate on account of those who defy or betray it. When the disbelievers do this, they become engulfed in ignorance and misguidance far away from truth, and therefore, there is no hope that they will gain guidance and correctness while on this state."

He ordained the prayer, which affirms the worship of Allah alone, without partners, and to spend from the provisions that He has granted them, by paying the due Zakah, spending on relatives and being kind to all others. Establishing the prayer requires performing it on time, perfectly, preserving its act of bowing having humility during it, and preserving its prostrations. Allah has ordained spending from what He granted, in secret and public, so that the people save themselves,\nمِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ\n(before the coming of a Day), the Day of Resurrection,\nلاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خِلَـلٌ\n(on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.) on which no ransom will be accepted from anyone, if he seeks to buy himself. Allah said in another Ayah,\nفَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنكُمْ فِدْيَةٌ وَلاَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you, nor of those who disbelieved.) 57:15 Allah said here,\nوَلاَ خِلَـلٌ\n(nor befriending.) Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah says that on that Day, there will be no friendship between friends that might save those deserving punishment from it. Rather, on that Day, there will be fairness and justice.\" Qatadah said, \"Allah knows that in this life, there is mutual bargaining and there are friendships which people benefit from. A man chooses his friends and the reasons behind befriending them; if it was for Allah's sake, their friendship should be maintained, but if it was for other than Allah, their friendship is bound to be cutoff.\" I say that the meaning of this, is that Allah the Exalted is declaring that on that Day, no mutual bargaining or ransom will avail anyone, even if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold if he could find that amount! No friendship or intercession shall avail one if he meets Allah while a disbeliever. Allah the Exalted said,\nوَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا لاَّ تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَـعَةٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ\n(And fear the Day when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped.)2:123 and,\nيأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَنفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَـكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خُلَّةٌ وَلاَ شَفَـعَةٌ وَالْكَـفِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ\n(O you believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.)2:254"

      "text": "Describing Some of Allah's Tremendous Favors\nAllah mentions some of the favors He has done for His creatures, such as creating the heavens as a protective ceiling and the earth as a bed. He also sends down rain from the sky and, in its aftermath brings forth a variety of vegetation, fruits and plants of different colors, shapes, tastes, scents and uses. Allah also made the ships sail on the surface of the water by His command and He made the sea able to carry these ships in order that travelers can transfer from one area to another to transport goods. Allah also created the rivers that flow through the earth from one area to another as provision for the servants which they use to drink and irrigate, and for other benefits,\nوَسَخَّر لَكُمُ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ دَآئِبَينَ\n(And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses), rotating by night and by day,\nلاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ\n(It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.)36:40 and,\nيُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54 The sun and the moon rotate in succession, and the night and the day are opposites, each taking from the length of the other or giving up some of its length,\nيُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ\n((Allah ) merges the night into day, and merges the day into night.) 35:13 and,\nوَسَخَّـرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُـلٌّ يَجْرِى لاًّجَـلٍ مُّسَـمًّى أَلا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفَّارُ\n(And He has subjected the sun and the moon. Each running (on a fixed course) for an appointed term. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving.) 39:5 Allah said next,\nوَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ\n(And He gave you of all that you asked for), He has prepared for you all that you need in all conditions, and what you ask Him to provide for you,\nوَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا\n(and if you try to count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them.) Allah states that the servants are never able to count His blessings, let alone thank Him duly for them. In Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to supplicate;\n«اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ غَيْرَ مَكْفِيَ وَلَا مُوَدَّعٍ وَلَا مُسْتَغْنًى عَنْهُ رَبَّنَا»\n(O Allah ! All praise is due to You, without being able to sufficiently thank You, nor ever wish to be cutoff from You, nor ever feeling rich from relying on You; our Lord!) It was reported that Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication, \"O Lord! How can I ever duly thank You, when my thanking You is also a favor from You to me\" Allah the Exalted answered him, \"Now, you have thanked Me sufficiently, O Dawud,\" meaning, `when you admitted that you will never be able to duly thank Me.'"

He also states that Ibrahim, who establsihed the city, has disowned those who worship others besides Allah, and that he begged Allah to make Makkah peaceful and secure,\nرَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا\n(O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) of peace and security,) and Allah accepted his supplication.

Make this city (Makkah) a place of peace and security.) 2:126 as we in explained in Surat Al-Baqarah. Ibrahim then said,\nوَاجْنُبْنِى وَبَنِىَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الاٌّصْنَامَ\n(and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.) It is proper for whoever supplicates to Allah to also ask for the benefit of his parents and offspring, as well as himself. Ibrahim next mentioned that many among mankind were led astray because of idols, and he disowned those who worship them and referred their matter to Allah; if Allah wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive them. `Isa, peace be upon him, said similar words,\nإِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ\n(If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)5:118 This supplication refers this and all matters to Allah, not that it is actually going to happen. `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited Ibrahim's supplication,\nرَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ\n(O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.), and the supplication of `Isa,\nإِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ\n(If You punish them, they are Your servants.) 5:118 then raised his hands and said,\n«اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي»\n(O Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah!) and cried. Allah said to the angel Jibril, \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad ﷺ, and Your Lord has more knowledge, and ask him what makes him cry.\" Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, and he repeated to him what he said (in his supplication). Allah said, \"Go to Muhammad ﷺ and tell him this; `We will make you pleased with your Ummah, O Muhammad, and will not treat them in a way you dislike.\"'"

His promise to grant them victory in this life and on the Day when the Witnesses shall come forth. Allah affirms that He is All-Able and that nothing He wills escapes His power and none can resist Him.

I pushed him with such a force that almost caused him to fall down and he asked me why I did that. I said, `Why did you not say, `O Messenger of Allah' The Jew said, `We call him by the name which his family gave him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اسْمِي مُحَمَّدٌ الَّذِي سَمَّانِي بِهِ أهْلِي»\n(Muhammad is indeed the name which my family gave me.) The Jew said, `I came to ask you about something.'

His promise to grant them victory in this life and on the Day when the Witnesses shall come forth. Allah affirms that He is All-Able and that nothing He wills escapes His power and none can resist Him. Allah affirms that He is Able to exact retribution from those who disbelieve in Him and deny Him,\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!)77:15 Allah said here,\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens,) meaning, His promise shall come to pass on the Day when the earth will be changed to an earth other than this earth that we know and recognize. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يُحْشَرُ النَّاسُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَى أَرْضٍ بَيْضَاءَ عَفْرَاءَ كَقُرْصَةِ النَّقِيِّ لَيْسَ فِيهَا مَعْلَمٌ لِأَحَد»\n(On the Day of Resurrection, the people will be gathered on a white (barren), flat earth just like the wheat bread, it has no recognizable features for anyone.)

At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it, and At-Tirmidhi said \"Hasan Sahih\".

I pushed him with such a force that almost caused him to fall down and he asked me why I did that. I said, `Why did you not say, `O Messenger of Allah' The Jew said, `We call him by the name which his family gave him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اسْمِي مُحَمَّدٌ الَّذِي سَمَّانِي بِهِ أهْلِي»\n(Muhammad is indeed the name which my family gave me.) The Jew said, `I came to ask you about something.'

Mujahid said that this part of the Ayah refers to the nine miracles.\nأَنْ أَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ\n(Bring out your people) he is being commanded;\nأَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ\n(Bring out your people from darkness into light,) call them to all that is good and righteous, in order that they might turn away from the darkness of ignorance and misguidance they indulged in, to the light of guidance and the enlightenment of faith,\nوَذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ اللَّهِ\n(and remind them of the annals (or days) of Allah) remind them (O Musa) of Allah's days, meaning, favors and bounties which He bestowed on them when He delivered them from the grip of Fir`awn and his injustice, tyranny and brutality. This is when Allah delivered them from their enemy, made a passage for them through the sea, shaded them with clouds, sent down manna and quails for them, and other favors and bounties. Mujahid, Qatadah and several others said this. Allah said next,\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ\n(Truly, therein are Ayat for every patient, thankful (person).) Allah says, `Our delivering of Our loyal supporters among the Children of Israel from the grasp of Fir`awn and saving them from the disgraceful torment, provides a lesson to draw from for those who are patient in the face of affliction, and thankful in times of prosperity. Qatadah said, \"Excellent is the servant who if he is tested, he observes patience, and if he is granted prosperity, he is thankful for it.\" It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ أَمْرَ الْمُؤْمِنِ كُلَّهُ عَجَبٌ، لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَه»\n(Verily, all of the matter of the believer is amazing, for every decision that Allah decrees for him is good for him. If an affliction strikes him, he is patient and this is good for him; if a bounty is give to him, he is thankful and this is good for him.)\nوَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ أَنجَاكُمْ مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِى ذلِكُمْ بَلاءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ - وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِى لَشَدِيدٌ - وَقَالَ مُوسَى إِن تَكْفُرُواْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ"

Allah said next,\nلِيَجْزِىَ اللَّهُ كُلَّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ\n(That Allah may requite each person according to what he has earned.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in another Ayah,\nلِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ\n(That He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done.) 53:31 Allah said here,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ\n(Truly, Allah is swift at reckoning.) when He wills to reckon a servants of His, for He knows everything and nothing ever escapes His observation. Verily, His power over all of His creation is the same as His power over one creature,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person. )31:28 And this is why Mujahid said,\nسَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ\n(swift at reckoning), means \"keeping count.\""

Ibn Ishaq reported that `Amr bin Maymun said that `Abdullah said about Allah's statement,\nلاَ يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ\n(None knows them but Allah.) \"The genealogists utter lies.\" This is why `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, \"We did not find anyone who knows the forefathers of Ma`dd bin `Adnan.\"\nMeaning of, \"They put Their Hands in Their Mouths\nAllah said next,\nفَرَدُّواْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى أَفْوَاهِهِمْ\n(but they put their hands in their mouths) It is said that they pointed to the Messengers' mouths asking them to stop calling them to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. It is also said that it means, they placed their hands on their mouths in denial of the Messengers. It was also said that it means that they did not answer the call of the Messengers, or they were biting their hands in rage. Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Qatadah said that they belied the Messengers and refuted their call with their mouths. I (Ibn Kathir) say that Mujahid's Tafsir is supported by the completion of the narrative,\nوَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّا لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَنَآ إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ\n(and said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us.\") Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When they heard Allah's Word, they were amazed and placed their hands on their mouths,\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ\n(and said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") They said, We do not believe what you brought us, and have strong doubt in its authenticity.
