  "text": "Admonition from Some Scenes of the Day of Resurrection\nAllah the Exalted said,\nوَاسْتَمِعْ\n(And listen) `O Muhammad,'\nيَوْمَ يُنَادِ الْمُنَادِ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ\n(on the Day when the caller will call from a near place.) to the gathering for the Day of Judgement,\nيَوْمَ يَسْمَعُونَ الصَّيْحَةَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(The Day when they will hear As-Sayhah in truth,) in reference to the blowing in the Trumpet which will bring forth the truth that most of them discounted and denied,\nذَلِكَ يَوْمُ الْخُرُوجِ\n(that will be the Day of coming out.) from the graves,\nإِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ وَنُمِيتُ وَإِلَيْنَا الْمَصِيرُ\n(Verily, it is We Who give life and cause death; and to Us is the final return.) Allah is He Who starts creation and then brings it back to life, and the latter is easier for Him; to Him is the final return of all creations. At this time, He will recompense each according to his or her deeds, good for good and evil for evil. Allah the Exalted said,\nيَوْمَ تَشَقَّقُ الاٌّرْضُ عَنْهُمْ سِرَاعاً\n(On the Day when the earth shall be cleft, from off them (they will come out) hastening forth.) Allah the Exalted and Most Honored will send down rain from the sky. From that rain the bodies of the creations will grow while they are in their graves, just as the seed grows in soil in the aftermath of rain. When the bodies grow to their full strength, Allah the Exalted will command angel Israfil and he will blow in the Trumpet (for a second time). The souls will be enclosed in a hole in the Trumpet. When Israfil blows in the Trumpet, the souls will depart from it and will fly between the heavens and earth. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, will declare, \"By My grace and power, each soul shall return to the body that it used to inhabit,\" and indeed, every soul will return to its body. The soul will enter its body just as poison enters the body, then the earth will be uncovered from above them, and they will all stand and head towards the Reckoning place hastening to obey the command of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored,\nمُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ\n(Hastening towards the caller. The disbelievers will say: \"This is a hard Day.\")(54:8), and\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer (His Call) with (words of) His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed (in this world) but a little while!) (17:52) In the Sahih, it is recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أَنَا أَوَّلُ مَنْ تَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ الْأَرْض»\n(The earth will open up first around me.) Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,\nذَلِكَ حَشْرٌ عَلَيْنَا يَسِيرٌ\n(That will be a gathering, quite easy for Us.) `bringing them back to life is easy for Us and effortless.' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)(54:50), and,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as of a single person. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.) (31:28)\nComforting the Prophet\nThe statement of Allah the Exalted and Most High,\nنَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ\n(We know best what they say.) means, `Our knowledge is all encompassing of the denial that the idolators are confronting you with, so do not be concerned.' In similar Ayat, Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ - فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُنْ مِّنَ السَّـجِدِينَ\nوَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ\n(Indeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say. So glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him). And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death).) (15:97) Allah's statement,\nوَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِجَبَّارٍ\n(And you are not the one to force them.) says, `it is not you who forces them to accept the guidance; this is not a part of your mission.' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,\nفَذَكِّرْ بِالْقُرْءَانِ مَن يَخَافُ وَعِيدِ\n(But warn by the Qur'an; him who fears My threat.) meaning, `convey the Message of your Lord, for only those who fear Allah and dread His torment, and hope in His promise will remember and heed,'\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(Your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.)(13:40),\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them -- you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.)(88:21-22)\nلَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills.)(2:272) and,\nإِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.) (28:56) Allah's statement here,\nوَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِجَبَّارٍ فَذَكِّرْ بِالْقُرْءَانِ مَن يَخَافُ وَعِيدِ\n(And you are not the one to force them. But warn by the Qur'an; him who fears My threat.) Qatadah used to invoke Allah by saying, \"O Allah! Make us among those who fear Your threat and hope for Your promise, O Barr (Subtle, Kind, Courteous, and Generous), O Rahim (the Most Merciful).\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Qaf. All praise is due to Allah, He is for us, the most excellent Trustee.",
