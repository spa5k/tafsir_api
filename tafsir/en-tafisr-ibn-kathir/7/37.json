  "text": "Idolators enjoy Their destined Share in This Life, but will lose Their Supporters upon Death\nAllah said,\nفَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَـتِهِ\n(Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat) meaning, none is more unjust than whoever invents a lie about Allah or rejects the Ayat that He has revealed. Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُم مِّنَ الْكِتَـبِ\n(For such their appointed portion will reach them from the Book) refers to each person's deeds, alloted provisions and age. Similar was said by Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Allah said in similar statements,\nقُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ\n(Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successful. (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.) 10:69-70 and,\nوَمَن كَفَرَ فَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ كُفْرُهُ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً\n(And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men). We let them enjoy for a little while.) 31:23-24. Allah said next,\nحَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ\n(until when Our messengers come to them to take their souls.) Allah states that when death comes to the idolators and the angels come to capture their souls to take them to Hellfire, the angels horrify them, saying, \"Where are the so-called partners (of Allah) whom you used to call in the life of this world, invoking and worshipping them instead of Allah Call them so that they save you from what you are suffering.\" However, the idolators will reply,\nضَـلُّواْ عَنَّا\n(\"They have vanished and deserted us\") meaning, we have lost them and thus, we do not hope in their benefit or aid,\nوَشَهِدُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ\n(And they will bear witness against themselves) they will admit and proclaim against themselves,\nأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(that they were disbelievers.)",
