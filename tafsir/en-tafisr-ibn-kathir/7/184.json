Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَمَا صَـحِبُكُمْ بِمَجْنُونٍ\n(And (O people) your companion is not a madman.)81:22 Allah also said,\nقُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَحِدَةٍ أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ\n(Say: \"I exhort you to one (thing) only, that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.\") 34:46 meaning, `I ask you to stand for Allah in sincerity without stubbornness or bias,'\nمَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى\n(in pairs and singly) 34:46 individuals and in groups,\nثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ\n(and reflect) 34:46, about this man who brought the Message from Allah, is he mad If you do this, it will become clear to you that he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in truth and justice. Qatadah bin Di'amah said, \"We were informed that the Prophet of Allah once was on (Mount) As-Safa and called the Quraysh, subtribe by subtribe, proclaiming,\n«يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ، يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ فَحَذَّرَهُمْ بَأْسَ اللهِ وَوَقَائِعَ الله»\n(O Children of so-and-so, O Children of so-and-so! He warned them against Allah's might and what He has done (such as revenge from His enemies).) Some of them commented, `This companion of yours (Prophet Muhammad) is mad; he kept shouting until the morning' Allah sent down this Ayah,\nأَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(Do they not reflect There is no madness in their companion. He is but a plain warner) 7:184.\"'",
