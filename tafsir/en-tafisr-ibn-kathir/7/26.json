  "text": "Bestowing Raiment and Adornment on Mankind\nAllah reminds His servants that He has given them Libas and Rish. Libas refers to the clothes that are used to cover the private parts, while Rish refers to the outer adornments used for purposes of beautification. Therefore, the first type is essential while the second type is complimentary. Ibn Jarir said that Rish includes furniture and outer clothes. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on the Ayah,\nوَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى\n(and the Libas (raiment) of Taqwa...) \"When one fears Allah, Allah covers his errors. Hence the `Libas of Taqwa' (that the Ayah mentions).\"",
