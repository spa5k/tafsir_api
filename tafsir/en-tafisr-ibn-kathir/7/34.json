Allah then warned the Children of Adam that He sent to them Messengers who conveyed to them His Ayat. Allah also conveyed good news, as well as warning,\nفَمَنِ اتَّقَى وَأَصْلَحَ\n(then whosoever has Taqwa and becomes righteous) by abandoning the prohibitions and performing acts of obedience,\nفَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَوَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ عَنْهَآ\n(on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance,) meaning, their hearts denied the Ayat and they were too arrogant to abide by them,\nأُولَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ\n(they are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.) without end to their dwelling in it.",
