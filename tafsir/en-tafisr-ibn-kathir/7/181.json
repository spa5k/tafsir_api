It was reported that this Ayah refers to the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَة»\n(There will always be a group of my Ummah who are apparent on the Truth, unabated by those who fail or oppose them, until the (Last) Hour commences.) rIn another narration, the Messenger  ﷺ said,\n«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ عَلَى ذَلِك»\n(Until Allah's command (the Last Hour) comes while they are still like this. ) and in yet another narration,\n«وَهُمْ بِالشَّام»\n(And they will dwell in Ash-Sham (Greater Syria).)",
