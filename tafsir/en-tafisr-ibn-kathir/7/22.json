Mujahid said that they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise, \"Making them as a dress (or garment).\" Commenting on Allah's statement,\nيَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا\n(Stripping them of their raiment) 7:27 Wahb bin Munabbih said, \"The private parts of Adam and Hawwa' had a light covering them which prevented them from seeing the private parts of each other. When they ate from the tree, their private parts appeared to them.\" Ibn Jarir reported this statement with an authentic chain of narration. Abdur-Razzaq reported from Qatadah, \"Adam said, `O Lord! What if I repented and sought forgiveness' Allah said, `Then, I will admit you into Paradise.' As for Shaytan, he did not ask for forgiveness, but for respite. Each one of them was given what he asked for.\" Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim commented,\nرَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَآ أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ\n(\"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\") \"These are the words that Adam received from his Lord.\"",
