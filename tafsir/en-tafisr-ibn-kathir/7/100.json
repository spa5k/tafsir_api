  "text": "Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nأَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لِلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ أَهْلِهَآ\n(Is it not a guidance for those who inherit the earth from its previous inhabitants. ..) \"(Allah says,) did We not make clear to them that had We willed, We would have punished them because of their sins\" Mujahid and several others said similarly. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari explained this Ayah, \"Allah says, `Did We not make clear to those who succeeded on the earth after destroying the previous nations who used to dwell in that land. Then they followed their own ways, and behaved as they did and were unruly with their Lord. Did We not make clear to them that,\nأَن لَّوْ نَشَآءُ أَصَبْنَـهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ\n(that had We willed, We would have punished them for their sins.) by bringing them the same end that was decreed for those before them,\nوَنَطْبَعُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ\n(And We seal up their hearts), We place a cover over their heart,\nفَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ\n(so that they hear not), words of advice or reminding\"' I say that similarly, Allah said,\nأَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَـكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى\n(Is it not a guidance for them: how many generations We have destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they walk Verily, in this are signs indeed for men of understanding.) 20:128\nأَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَاتٍ أَفَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ\n(Is it not a guidance for them: how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings they do walk about Verily, therein indeed are signs. Would they not then listen) 32:26 and,\nأَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍوَسَكَنتُمْ فِى مَسَـكِنِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ\n(Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter). And you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves)14:44-45 Also, Allah said,\nوَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً\n(And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them) 19:98 meaning, do you see any of them or hear their voices There are many other Ayat that testify that Allah's torment strikes His enemies, while His bounty reaches His faithful believers. Thereafter comes Allah's statement, and He is the Most Truthful, the Lord of all that exists,",
