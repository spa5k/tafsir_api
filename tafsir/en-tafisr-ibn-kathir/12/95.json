He said,\nإِنِّى لأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ\n(I do indeed feel the smell of Yusuf , if only you think me not senile.) He found his scent from a distance of eight days away!\" Similar was also reported through Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah and others reported it from Abu Sinan. Ya`qub said to them,\nلَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ\n(if only you think me not senile.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ata, Qatadah and Sa'id bin Jubayr commented, \"If only you think me not a fool!\" Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that it means, \"If only you think me not old.\" Their answer to him was,\nإِنَّكَ لَفِى ضَلَـلِكَ الْقَدِيمِ\n(Certainly, you are in your old Dalal.) meaning, `in your old error,' according to Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah commented, \"They meant that, `because of your love for Yusuf you will never forget him.' So they uttered a harsh word to their father that they should never have uttered to him, nor to a Prophet of Allah.\" Similar was said by As-Suddi and others.",
