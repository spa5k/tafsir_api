Verily, he has an old father...\") who loves him very much and is comfor- ted by his presence from the son that he lost,\nفَخُذْ أَحَدَنَا مَكَانَهُ\n(so take one of us in his place.), instead of Binyamin to remain with you,\nإِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Indeed we think that you are one of the doers of good.), the good doers, just, and accepting fairness,\nقَالَ مَعَاذَ اللَّهِ أَن نَّأْخُذَ إِلاَّ مَن وَجَدْنَا مَتَـعَنَا عِندَهُ\n(He said: \"Allah forbid, that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property...\"), `according to the judgement that you gave for his punishment,\nإِنَّـآ إِذًا لَّظَـلِمُونَ\n(Indeed, we should be wrongdoers.), if we take an innocent man instead of the guilty man.
