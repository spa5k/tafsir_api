  "text": "This Ayah includes ten separate and independent ideas, each of which is a ruling on its own.\nThey (the scholars) said that there is nothing else like it in the Qur'an, apart from Ayat Al-Kursi 2:255, which also includes ten ideas.\nفَلِذَلِكَ فَادْعُ\n(So unto this then invite (people),) means, `so call people to this which We have revealed to you and which We enjoined upon all the Prophets before you,' the Prophets of major ways of Shari`ah that were followed, such as the Messengers of strong will, and others.\nوَاسْتَقِمْ كَمَآ أُمِرْتَ\n(and stand firm as you are commanded, ) means, `adhere firmly, you and those who follow you, to the worship of Allah as He has commanded you.'\nوَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(and follow not their desires) means, the desires of the idolators, in the falsehoods that they have invented and fabricated by worshipping idols.\nوَقُلْ ءَامَنتُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِن كِتَـبٍ\n(but say: \"I believe in whatsoever Allah has sent down of the Book...\") means, `I believe in all the Books that have been revealed from heaven to the Prophets; we do not differentiate between any of them.'\nوَأُمِرْتُ لاًّعْدِلَ بَيْنَكُمُ\n(and I am commanded to do justice among you.) means, when judging according to the commands of Allah.\nاللَّهُ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ\n(Allah is our Lord and your Lord.) means, `He is the One Who is to be worshipped, and there is no true God but He. We affirm this willingly, and even though you do not do so willingly, everyone in the universe prostrates to Him obediently and willingly.'\nلَنَآ أَعْمَـلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَـلُكُمْ\n(For us our deeds and for you your deeds.) means, `we have nothing to do with you. ' This is like the Ayah:\nوَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّى عَمَلِى وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُمْ بَرِيئُونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَاْ بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(And if they demy you, say: \"For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do!\") (10:41)\nلاَ حُجَّةَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ\n(There is no dispute between us and you.) Mujahid said, \"This means, no argument.\" As-Suddi said, \"This was before Ayah of the sword was revealed.\" This fits the context, because this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Ayah of the sword 22:39-40 was revealed after the Hijrah.\nاللَّهُ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا\n(Allah will assemble us (all),) means, on the Day of Resurrection. This is like the Ayah:\nقُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِالْحَقِّ وَهُوَ الْفَتَّاحُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs.\") (34:26).\nوَإِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ\n(and to Him is the final return.) means, the final return on the Day of Reckoning.",
