  "text": "They longed for a Warner to come, but when He came, They disbelieved in Him\nAllah tells us how Quraysh and the Arabs swore by Allah their most binding oath before the Messenger came to them,\nلَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ\n(that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations;) i.e., than any of the nations to whom Messengers had been sent. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak and others. This is like the Ayat:\nأَن تَقُولُواْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ الْكِتَـبُ عَلَى طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَـفِلِينَ أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَـبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَـتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا\n(Lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So, now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and turns away therefrom) (6:156-157)\nوَإِن كَانُواْ لَيَقُولُونَ - لَوْ أَنَّ عِندَنَا ذِكْراً مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\nلَكُنَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ - فَكَفَرُواْ بِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(And indeed they (Arab pagans) used to say: \"If we had a reminder as had the men of old, We would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah!\" But they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know!) (37:167-170) Allah says:\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ\n(yet when a warner came to them,) -- meaning, Muhammad ﷺ with the Book revealed to him, i.e., the Clear Qur'an,\nمَّا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ نُفُوراً\n(it increased in them nothing but flight (from the truth).) means, they only increased in their disbelief. Then Allah explains this further:\nاسْتِكْبَاراً فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n((They took to flight because of their) arrogance in the land) means, they were too arrogant to follow the signs of Allah.\nوَمَكْرَ السَّيِّىءِ\n(and their plotting of evil.) means, they plotted to prevent people from following the path of Allah.\nوَلاَ يَحِيقُ الْمَكْرُ السَّيِّىءُ إِلاَّ بِأَهْلِهِ\n(But the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it.) means, the evil consequences of that will come back upon them and not on others.\nفَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ سُنَّةَ آلاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(Then, can they expect anything (else) but the Sunnah (way of dealing) of the peoples of old) meaning, the punishment of Allah for disbelieving in His Messengers and going against His command.\nوَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً\n(and no turning off will you find in Allah's Sunnah.) means, it does not change or alter, and this is what happens to every disbeliever.\nوَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَحْوِيلاً\n(and no turning off will you find in Allah's Sunnah.) means,\nوَإِذَآ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلاَ مَرَدَّ لَهُ\n(But when Allah wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it) (13:11). This means, no one can remove that from them or ward it off from them. And Allah knows best.",
