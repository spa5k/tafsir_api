  "text": "The gods of the Idolators do not even own a Qitmir\nAnother aspect of His perfect power and might is that He has subjugated the night with its darkness and the day with its light. He takes from the length of the one and adds it to the shortness of the other, until they become equal. Then He takes from the latter and adds to the former, so one becomes long and the other becomes short, so they take from one another in summer and in winter.\nوَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ\n(And He has subjected the sun and the moon,) and the stars and planets, with their light. All of them run in their appointed courses and in the manner prescribed for them, as decreed by the Almighty, All-Knowing.\nكُـلٌّ يَجْرِى لاًّجَـلٍ مُّسَـمًّى\neach runs its course for a term appointed. means, until the Day of Resurrection.\nذَلِكُـمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّـكُمْ\nSuch is Allah, your Lord؟ means, the One Who has done all this is the Almighty Lord besides Whom there is no other true God.\nوَالَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ\n(And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him,) means, `the idols and false gods whom you claim to be in the form of angels who are close to Allah,'\nمَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ\nown not even a Qitلm0r. Ibn Abba0s, may Allah be pleased with him, Muja0hid, Ikrimah, Ata0 , Atلiyah Al- Awfi, Al-Hلasan, Qata0dah and others said, This is the thread that is attached to the pit of a date. In other words, they do not possess anything in the heavens or on earth, not even anything equivalent to this Qitلm0r. Then Allah says:\nإِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُواْ دُعَآءَكُمْ\n(If you invoke them, they hear not your call;) means, `the gods upon whom you call instead of Allah, do not hear your supplication, because they are inanimate and have no soul in them.'\nوَلَوْ سَمِعُواْ مَا اسْتَجَابُواْ لَكُمْ\n(and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it to you.) means, `they are not able to do any of the things that you ask them for.'\nوَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُونَ بِشِرْكِـكُمْ\nAnd on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them means, `they will disown you.' This is like the Ayat:\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And who is more astray than one who calls on besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5-6), and\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.) (19:81-82)\nوَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ\n(And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) means, no one can tell you about the consequences of things and how they will end like the One Who is the All-Knower of them. Qatadah said, \"He is referring to Himself, may He be blessed and exalted, for He undoubtedly tells the truth.\"",
