  "text": "The Evidence of Tawhid\nAllah shows His servants that they should worship Him Alone, for just as He is Independent in His power of creation and provision, so He should be worshipped Alone with no partners or associates such as idols and false gods. So Allah says:\nلاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّى تُؤْفَكُونَ\n(La ilaha illa Huwa. How then are you turning away (from Him)) meaning, `how can you turn away from Him after this has been made clear and this proof has been made obvious, but you still worship idols and false gods' And Allah knows best.",
