  "text": "Everything that affects Mankind, is duly measured and destined\nAllah reminds of His measuring and deciding the destiny of all things before He created the creation,\nمَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ\n(No calamity occurs on the earth nor in yourselves) meaning, `there is nothing that touches you or happens in existence,'\nإِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَآ\n(but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We bring it into existence.) meaning, `before We created the creation and started life.' Qatadah commented on this Ayah,\nمَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(No calamity occurs on the earth) refers to famine, while,\nوَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ\n(or nor in yourselves) refers to suffering and diseases.\" He also said, \"We were told that every person who suffers a prick of a thorn, a twisted ankle, or a bleeding vein, has it occur on account of his sins. What Allah forgives is even more.\" This great, honorable Ayah provides clear evidence to the misguidance of the cursed Qadariyyah sect, who deny Allah's Preordaihnent and His knowledge of everything before it occurs. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«قَدَّرَ اللهُ الْمَقَادِيرَ قَبلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Allah ordained the measures (of everything) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.)\" Muslim collected this Hadith in his Sahih with the addition:\n«وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»\n(And His Throne was over the water.) At-Tirmidhi also collected it and said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement,\nإِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ\n(Verily, that is easy for Allah.) means that He knows all things before they occur, and He records them exactly as they will occur when they occur, and this is easy for Him. Verily, Allah knows what happened, what will happen and what did not happen, and what shape and form it will take if it were to happen.\nOrdering Patience and Gratitude\nAllah said,\nلِّكَيْلاَ تَأْسَوْاْ عَلَى مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَفْرَحُواْ بِمَآ ءَاتَـكُمْ\n(In order that you may not grieve at the things over that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you.) meaning, `We informed you of Our encompassing knowledge, recording all things before they occur and creating all things in due measure known to Us, so that you may know that what has met you would never have missed you and what has missed you would never have met you. Therefore, do not grieve for what you have missed of fortune, because had it been destined for you, you would have achieved it.' (It is also recited:) (وَلَا تَفْرَحُوْا بِمَا أَتَاكُمْ) (nor rejoice over that which came to you) meaning, come to you. According to the recitation,\nءَاتَـكُمُ\nit means (which has been given to you.) Both meanings are related. Allah says here, `do not boast before people about what Allah has favored you with, because it is not you who earned it by your efforts. Rather, all this came your way because Allah destined them for you and provided them for you as provisions. Therefore, do not use what Allah has granted you as a reason to boast and become arrogant with others.' Allah's statement,\nوَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ\n(And Allah likes not prideful boasters.) meaning, who acts arrogantly with other people. `Ikrimah commented by saying, \"Everyone of us feels happiness and grief. However, make your joy with gratitude and endure your grief with patience.\"\nCensuring the Stinginess\nAllah the Exalted then said,\nالَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبُخْلِ\n(Those who are misers and enjoin miserliness upon people.) meaning those who commit evil and encourage people to commit it,\nوَمَن يَتَوَلَّ\n(And whosoever turns away,) from abiding by Allah's commandments and obeying Him,\nفَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ\n(then Allah is Rich, Worthy of all praise.) As Musa, peace be upon him, said,\nإِن تَكْفُرُواْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ\n(If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.)(14:8)",
