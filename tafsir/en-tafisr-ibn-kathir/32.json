      "text": "Which was revealed in Al-Madinah\nThe Virtues of Surah Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah\nIn the Book of the Friday prayer, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet used to recite in Fajr on Fridays:\nالم تَنزِيلَ\n(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and\nهَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ\n(Has there not been over man...)Al-Insan (76).\" This was also recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said, \"The Prophet would never sleep until he recited:\nالم تَنزِيلَ\n(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and\nتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ\n(Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion) Al-Mulk (67).\"\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an is the Book of Allah in which there is no Doubt\nWe discussed the individual letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and there is no need to repeat it here.\nتَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt whatsoever that it has been revealed\nمِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(from the Lord of all that exists.) Then Allah tells us about the idolators:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ\n(Or say they: \"He has fabricated it\"): they say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.\nبَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.) means, in order that they may follow the truth."

      "text": "Refutation of Those Who think the Resurrection is unlikely to happen\nAllah tells us how the idolators thought it unlikely that the resurrection would ever come to pass, and how they said:\nأَءِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(When we are lost in the earth,) meaning, `when our bodies have been scattered and have disintegrated and dispersed in the earth,'\nأَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ\n(shall we indeed be created anew) means, `after that, will we come back again' They thought it unlikely that this would happen, and in terms of their own feeble abilities it is indeed unlikely, but this is not the case with regard to the power of the One Who created them from nothing, Who when He wills a thing merely says to it, \"Be!\" and it is. Allah says:\nبَلْ هُم بِلَقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَـفِرُونَ\n(Nay, but they deny the meeting with their Lord!) Then Allah says:\nقُلْ يَتَوَفَّـكُم مَّلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِى وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ\n(Say: \"The angel of death, who is set over you, will take your souls...\") The apparent meaning of this Ayah is that the angel of death is a specific personality among the angels, as is also apparent from the Hadith of Al-Bara' which we quoted in (our Tafsir of) Surah Ibrahim. In some reports he (the angel of death) is called `Izra'il, which is well known. This is the view of Qatadah and others. The angel of death has helpers. It was reported in the Hadith that his helpers draw out the soul from the rest of the body until it reaches the throat, then the angel of death takes it. Mujahid said, \"The earth is brought together for him and it is like a platter from which he takes whenever he wants.\"\nثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(Then you shall be brought to your Lord.) means, on the Day when you are resurrected and brought forth from your graves to receive your reward or punishment."

They will say:\nرَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا\n(Our Lord! We have now seen and heard,) meaning, `now we hear what You say and we will obey You.' This is like the Ayah,\nأَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا\n(How clearly will they see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38). And they will blame themselves when they enter the Fire, and will say:\nلَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِى أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ\n(\"Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!\") 67:10 Similarly, here they are described as saying:\nرَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا\n(Our Lord!

Allah says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60). Then Allah says:\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds,) meaning, they pray the voluntary night prayer and forego sleep and resting on a comfortable bed. Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that the Ayah\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds, ) refers to voluntary night prayer. Ad-Dahhak said, \"It refers to Salat Al-`Isha' in congregation and Salat Al-Fajr in congregation.\nيَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً\n(to invoke their Lord in fear and hope,) means, in fear of His punishment and in hope of His reward.\nوَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ\n(and they spend out of what We have bestowed on them.) means, they do both obligatory and supererogatory acts of worship. Their leader in this world and the Hereafter is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`adh bin Jabal said, \"I was with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on a journey one morning, walking near him. I said, `O Prophet of Allah, tell me of a deed that will grant me admittance to Paradise and keep me away from Hell.' He said:\n«لَقَدْ سَأَلْتَ عَنْ عَظِيمٍ وَإِنَّهَ لَيَسِيرٌ عَلَى مَنْ يَسَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ، تَعْبُدُ اللهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئًا، وَتُقِيمُ الصَّلَاةَ وَتُؤْتِي الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومُ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجُّ الْبَيْت»\n(You have asked about something great, and it is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy. Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him, establish regular prayer, pay Zakah, fast Ramadan and perform pilgrimage to the House.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ الْخَيْرِ؟ الصَّومُ جُنَّةٌ، وَالصَّدَقَةُ تُطْفِىءُ الْخَطِيئَةَ، وَصَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي جَوْفِ اللَّيْل»\n(Shall I not tell you of the gates of goodness Fasting is a shield, charity wipes out sin, and the prayer of a man in the depths of the night.) Then he recited:\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds,) until he reached\nجَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(as a reward for what they used to do.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أُخْبِرُكَ بِرَأْسِ الْأَمْرِ وَعَمُودِهِ وَذِرْوَةِ سَنَامِهِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you of the greatest of all things and its pillars and pinnacle) I said, `Of course, O Messenger of Allah.' He said:\n«رَأْسُ الْأَمْرِ الْإسْلَامُ، وَعَمُودُهُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَذِرْوَةُ سَنَامِهِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»\n(The greatest of all things is Islam, its pillars are the prayers and its pinnacle is Jihad for the sake of Allah.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أُخْبِرُكَ بِمَلَاكِ ذلِكَ كُلِّهِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you the factor on which all of that depends) I said, `Of course, O Messenger of Allah.' He took hold of his tongue and said,\n«كُفَّ عَلَيْكَ هذَا»\n(Restrain this.) I said, `O Messenger of Allah, will we be accountable for what we say' He said,\n«ثَكِلَتْكَ أُمُّكُ يَا مُعَاذُ، وَهَلْ يَكُبُّ النَّاسَ فِي النَّارِ عَلى وُجُوهِهِمْ أَوْ قَالَ: عَلى مَنَاخِرِهِمْ إِلَّا حَصَائِدُ أَلْسِنَتهِم»\n(May your mother be bereft of you, O Mu`adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell -- (or he said) on their faces -- except because of what their tongues say) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\"\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) means, no one knows the vastness of what Allah has concealed for them of everlasting joy in Paradise and delights such as no one has ever seen. Because they conceal their good deeds, Allah conceals the reward for them, a fitting reward which will suit their deeds. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If people conceal their good deeds, Allah will conceal for them what no eye has seen and what has never crossed the mind of man. It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Al-Bukhari quoted the Ayah: d\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) Then he recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى: أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ، وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ، وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلى قَلْبِ بَشَر»\n(Allah says: \"I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and it has never crossed the mind of man.\") Abu Hurayrah said: \"Recite, if you wish:\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes.)

At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\" In another version of Al-Bukhari:\n«وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ، ذُخْرًا مِنْ بَلْهِ مَا أُطْلِعْتُمْ عَلَيْه»\n(\"and no body has ever even imagined of. All that is reserved, besides which, all that you have seen is nothing.\") It was also reported from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said:\n«مَنْ يَدْخُلِ الْجَنَّةَ يَنْعَمْ لَا يَبْأَسْ، لَا تَبْلَى ثِيَابُهُ، وَلَا يَفْنَى شَبَابُهُ، فِي الْجَنَّةِ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ، وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ، وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلى قَلْبِ بَشَر»\n(Whoever enters Paradise, will enjoy a life of luxury and never feel deprivation, his clothes will never wear out, his youth will never fade. In Paradise there is what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and has never crossed the mind of man.) This was recorded by Muslim."

Allah says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60). Then Allah says:\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds,) meaning, they pray the voluntary night prayer and forego sleep and resting on a comfortable bed. Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that the Ayah\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds, ) refers to voluntary night prayer. Ad-Dahhak said, \"It refers to Salat Al-`Isha' in congregation and Salat Al-Fajr in congregation.\nيَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً\n(to invoke their Lord in fear and hope,) means, in fear of His punishment and in hope of His reward.\nوَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ\n(and they spend out of what We have bestowed on them.) means, they do both obligatory and supererogatory acts of worship. Their leader in this world and the Hereafter is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`adh bin Jabal said, \"I was with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on a journey one morning, walking near him. I said, `O Prophet of Allah, tell me of a deed that will grant me admittance to Paradise and keep me away from Hell.' He said:\n«لَقَدْ سَأَلْتَ عَنْ عَظِيمٍ وَإِنَّهَ لَيَسِيرٌ عَلَى مَنْ يَسَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ، تَعْبُدُ اللهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئًا، وَتُقِيمُ الصَّلَاةَ وَتُؤْتِي الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومُ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجُّ الْبَيْت»\n(You have asked about something great, and it is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy. Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him, establish regular prayer, pay Zakah, fast Ramadan and perform pilgrimage to the House.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ الْخَيْرِ؟ الصَّومُ جُنَّةٌ، وَالصَّدَقَةُ تُطْفِىءُ الْخَطِيئَةَ، وَصَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي جَوْفِ اللَّيْل»\n(Shall I not tell you of the gates of goodness Fasting is a shield, charity wipes out sin, and the prayer of a man in the depths of the night.) Then he recited:\nتَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ\n(Their sides forsake their beds,) until he reached\nجَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(as a reward for what they used to do.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أُخْبِرُكَ بِرَأْسِ الْأَمْرِ وَعَمُودِهِ وَذِرْوَةِ سَنَامِهِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you of the greatest of all things and its pillars and pinnacle) I said, `Of course, O Messenger of Allah.' He said:\n«رَأْسُ الْأَمْرِ الْإسْلَامُ، وَعَمُودُهُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَذِرْوَةُ سَنَامِهِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»\n(The greatest of all things is Islam, its pillars are the prayers and its pinnacle is Jihad for the sake of Allah.) Then he said:\n«أَلَا أُخْبِرُكَ بِمَلَاكِ ذلِكَ كُلِّهِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you the factor on which all of that depends) I said, `Of course, O Messenger of Allah.' He took hold of his tongue and said,\n«كُفَّ عَلَيْكَ هذَا»\n(Restrain this.) I said, `O Messenger of Allah, will we be accountable for what we say' He said,\n«ثَكِلَتْكَ أُمُّكُ يَا مُعَاذُ، وَهَلْ يَكُبُّ النَّاسَ فِي النَّارِ عَلى وُجُوهِهِمْ أَوْ قَالَ: عَلى مَنَاخِرِهِمْ إِلَّا حَصَائِدُ أَلْسِنَتهِم»\n(May your mother be bereft of you, O Mu`adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell -- (or he said) on their faces -- except because of what their tongues say) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\"\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) means, no one knows the vastness of what Allah has concealed for them of everlasting joy in Paradise and delights such as no one has ever seen. Because they conceal their good deeds, Allah conceals the reward for them, a fitting reward which will suit their deeds. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If people conceal their good deeds, Allah will conceal for them what no eye has seen and what has never crossed the mind of man. It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Al-Bukhari quoted the Ayah: d\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) Then he recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى: أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ، وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ، وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلى قَلْبِ بَشَر»\n(Allah says: \"I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and it has never crossed the mind of man.\") Abu Hurayrah said: \"Recite, if you wish:\nفَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ\n(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes.)

This is like the Ayat:\nأَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَـهُمْ وَمَمَـتُهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ\n(Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death Worst is the judgement that they make.)

Hence Allah has judged between them when He said:\nأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(As for those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) meaning, their hearts believed in the signs of Allah, and they did as the signs of Allah dictate, i.e. righteous good deeds.\nفَلَهُمْ جَنَّـتُ الْمَأْوَى\n(for them are Gardens of Abode) i.e., in which there are dwellings and houses and lofty apartments.\nنُزُلاً\n(as an entertainment) means, something to welcome and honor a guest,\nبِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَوَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فَسَقُواْ\n(for what they used to do. And as for those who rebel,) means, those who disobeyed Allah, their dwelling place will be the Fire, and every time they want to escape from it, they will be thrown back in, as Allah says:\nكُلَّمَآ أَرَادُواْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا\n(Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be driven back therein) (22:22).

Qatadah said: \"Beware of turning away from the remembrance of Allah, for whoever turns away from remembering Him will be the most misguided and the most in need, and the most guilty of sin.\" Allah says, warning the one who does that:\nإِنَّا مِنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ\n(Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.) meaning, `We shall avenge Ourselves on those who do that in the strongest possible terms.'"

Qatadah said: \"Beware of turning away from the remembrance of Allah, for whoever turns away from remembering Him will be the most misguided and the most in need, and the most guilty of sin.\" Allah says, warning the one who does that:\nإِنَّا مِنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ\n(Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.) meaning, `We shall avenge Ourselves on those who do that in the strongest possible terms.'"

Then Allah tells us about the idolators:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ\n(Or say they: \"He has fabricated it\"): they say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.\nبَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.) means, in order that they may follow the truth."

      "ayah": 30,

      "text": "How the Disbelievers sought to hasten on the Punishment, and what happened to Them\nAllah tells us how the disbelievers sought to hasten on the punishment, and to bring the wrath and vengeance of Allah upon themselves, because they thought this punishment would never happen, and because of their disbelief and stubbornness.\nوَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْفَتْحُ\n(They say: \"When will this Fath be...\") meaning, `when will you prevail over us, O Muhammad, since you claim that there will be a time when you will gain the upper hand over us and take your revenge on us, so when will that happen All we see of you and your companions is that you are hiding, afraid and humiliated.' Allah says:\nقُلْ يَوْمَ الْفَتْحِ\n(Say: \"On the Day of Al-Fath...\") meaning, `when the wrath and punishment of Allah befall you, in this world and the next,'\nلاَ يَنفَعُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِيَمَـنُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ\n(no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.) This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ فَرِحُواْ بِمَا عِندَهُمْ مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ\n(Then when their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were glad with that which they had of the knowledge...) (40:83-85) Those who claim that this refers to the conquest of Makkah go too far, and have made a grievous mistake, for on the day of the conquest of Makkah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ accepted the Islam of the freed Makkan prisoners-of-war, who numbered nearly two thousand. If what was meant by this Ayah was the conquest of Makkah, he would not have accepted their Islam, because Allah says:\nقُلْ يَوْمَ الْفَتْحِ لاَ يَنفَعُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِيَمَـنُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ\n(Say: \"On the Day of Al-Fath, no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.\") What is meant by Al-Fath here is Judgement, as in the Ayat:\nفَافْتَحْ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُمْ فَتْحاً\n(Nuh said: So Aftah (judge) between me and them) (26:118). and:\nقُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِالْحَقِّ\n(Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth\") (34:26).\nوَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(And they sought judgement and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction. ) (14:15)\nوَكَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(although aforetime they had invoked Allah to pass judgement over those who disbelieved) (2:89)\nإِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ\n(If you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come unto you) (8:19). Then Allah says:\nفَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَانتَظِرْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّنتَظِرُونَ\n(So turn aside from them and await, verily, they (too) are awaiting.) meaning, `turn away from these idolators, and convey that which has been revealed to you from your Lord.' This is like the Ayah,\nاتَّبِعْ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no God but Him.) (6:106) `Wait until Allah fulfills that which He has promised you, and grants you victory over those who oppose you, for He never breaks His promise.'\nعَنْهُمْ وَانتَظِرْ\n(verily, they (too) are awaiting.) means, `you are waiting, and they are waiting and plotting against you,'\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ شَاعِرٌ نَّتَرَبَّصُ بِهِ رَيْبَ الْمَنُونِ\n(Or do they say: \"A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!\") (52:30). `You will see the consequences of your patience towards them, and the fulfillment of the promise of your Lord in your victory over them, and they will see the consequences of their wait for something bad to befall you and your Companions, in that Allah's punishment will come upon them.' Sufficient unto us is Allah, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat As-Sajdah."

That is He, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen,) meaning, He is controlling all these affairs. He sees all that His servants do, and all their deeds, major and minor, significant and insignificant, ascend to Him. He is the Almighty Who has subjugated all things to His control, and to Whom everybody submits, and He is Most Merciful to His believing servants. He is Almighty in His mercy and Most Merciful in His might. This is perfection: might combined with mercy and mercy combined with might, for He is Merciful without any hint of weakness."
