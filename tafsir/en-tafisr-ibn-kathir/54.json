      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon\nAllah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,\nأَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ\n(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),\nاقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ\n(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)\nHadiths about the Last Hour\nThere are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,\n«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»\n(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»\n(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»\n(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»\n(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,\nوَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split\nThe Narration of Anas bin Malik\nImam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.\nThe Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im\nImam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr\nAl-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,\n«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»\n(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud\nImam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«اشْهَدُوا»\n(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and I saw the mount between its two parts.\nThe Stubbornness of the idolators\nAllah said,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,\nيُعْرِضُواْ\n(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,\nوَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,\nوَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ\n(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,\nمَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ\n(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,\nحِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ\n(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,\nفَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ\n(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts. Who can guide such people after Allah This Ayah is similar to Allah's statements,\nقُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَـلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.\")(6:149) and,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)(10:101)"

They rejected Our servant) means, they denied him categorically and accused him of madness,\nوَقَالُواْ مَجْنُونٌ وَازْدُجِرَ\n(and said: \"A madman!\" Wazdujir.) Mujahid said about Wazdujir: \"He was driven out accused on account of madness.\" It was also said that Wazdujir means, he was rebuked, deterred, threatened and warned by his people saying:\nلَئِنْ لَّمْ تَنْتَهِ ينُوحُ لَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُرْجُومِينَ\n(\"If you do not stop O Nuh, you will be among those who will be stoned.\") 26:116 This was said by Ibn Zayd, and it is sound.\nفَدَعَا رَبَّهُ أَنُّى مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ\n(Then he invoked his Lord (saying): \"I have been overcome, so help (me)!\") meaning, `I am weak and cannot overcome or resist my people, so help Your religion!' Allah the Exalted said,\nفَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَبَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ\n(So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir.) As-Suddi said about Munhamir, \"It means abundant.\"\nوَفَجَّرْنَا الاٌّرْضَ عُيُوناً\n(And We caused springs to gush forth from the earth.) means, from every part of the earth, and even ovens in which fire was burning -- water and springs gushed forth,\nفَالْتَقَى المَآءُ\n(So, the waters met), means, of the heaven and the earth,\nعَلَى أَمْرٍ قَدْ قُدِرَ\n(for a matter predestined.) Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas:\nفَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَبَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ\n(So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir), Torrential rain, the only water that fell from the sky before that day and ever since was from clouds. But the sky's gates were opened on them that day, and therefore, the water that came down was not from clouds. So both the waters (of the earth and the heaven) met according to a matter ordained.\" Allah said,\nوَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَى ذَاتِ أَلْوَحٍ وَدُسُرٍ\n(And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails (Dusur)), Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Dusur means nails. Ibn Jarir preferred this view. Allah's statement,\nتَجْرِى بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(Floating under Our Eyes), means, `by Our command and under Our protection and observation,'\nجَزَآءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ\n(a reward for him who had been rejected!) meaning, as recompense for them because of their disbelief in Allah and as reward for Nuh, peace be upon him. Allah the Exalted said,\nوَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَـهَا ءايَةً\n(And indeed, We have left this as a sign.) Qatadah said, \"Allah left the ship of Nuh intact until the first generation of this Ummah were able to see it.\" However, it appears that the meaning here is that Allah kept ships as a sign. For instance, Allah the Exalted said,\nوَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ - وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ\n(And a sign for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship. And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.)(36:41-42),\nإِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ\n(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)(69:11-12) Allah's statement here,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember) means, `is there any that will receive admonition and reminder. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Prophet recited to me,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Al-Bukhari collected a similar Hadith from `Abdullah that he said, \"I recited to the Prophet (فَهَلْ مِن مُّذَّكِرٍ) (then is there any that will remember) and the Prophet said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Allah's statement,\nفَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ\n(Then how (terrible) was My torment and My warnings) means, `how terrible was My torment that I inflicted on those who disbelieved in Me and denied My Messengers, who did not heed to My warnings How was My help that I extended to My Messengers and the revenge exerted on their behalf,'\nوَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ\n(And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember); meaning, `We have made the Qur'an easy to recite and comprehend for those who seek these traits, to remind mankind,' as Allah said,\nكِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَـرَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُواْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُوْلُو الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n((This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.)(38:29),\nفَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ بِلَسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(So We have made this (the Qur'an) easy in your own tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.)(19:97) Allah said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember), meaning, `is there anyone who will remember through this Qur'an, which We made easy to memorize and easy to understand' Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi commented on this Ayah, \"Is there anyone who will avoid evil\""

And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.)(36:41-42),\nإِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ\n(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)(69:11-12) Allah's statement here,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember) means, `is there any that will receive admonition and reminder. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Prophet recited to me,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Al-Bukhari collected a similar Hadith from `Abdullah that he said, \"I recited to the Prophet (فَهَلْ مِن مُّذَّكِرٍ) (then is there any that will remember) and the Prophet said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Allah's statement,\nفَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ\n(Then how (terrible) was My torment and My warnings) means, `how terrible was My torment that I inflicted on those who disbelieved in Me and denied My Messengers, who did not heed to My warnings How was My help that I extended to My Messengers and the revenge exerted on their behalf,'\nوَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ\n(And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember); meaning, `We have made the Qur'an easy to recite and comprehend for those who seek these traits, to remind mankind,' as Allah said,\nكِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَـرَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُواْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُوْلُو الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n((This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.)(38:29),\nفَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ بِلَسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(So We have made this (the Qur'an) easy in your own tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.)(19:97) Allah said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember), meaning, `is there anyone who will remember through this Qur'an, which We made easy to memorize and easy to understand' Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi commented on this Ayah, \"Is there anyone who will avoid evil\""

But the sky's gates were opened on them that day, and therefore, the water that came down was not from clouds. So both the waters (of the earth and the heaven) met according to a matter ordained.\" Allah said,\nوَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَى ذَاتِ أَلْوَحٍ وَدُسُرٍ\n(And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails (Dusur)), Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Dusur means nails. Ibn Jarir preferred this view. Allah's statement,\nتَجْرِى بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(Floating under Our Eyes), means, `by Our command and under Our protection and observation,'\nجَزَآءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ\n(a reward for him who had been rejected!) meaning, as recompense for them because of their disbelief in Allah and as reward for Nuh, peace be upon him.

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon\nAllah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,\nأَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ\n(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),\nاقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ\n(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)\nHadiths about the Last Hour\nThere are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,\n«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»\n(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»\n(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»\n(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»\n(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,\nوَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split\nThe Narration of Anas bin Malik\nImam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.\nThe Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im\nImam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr\nAl-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,\n«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»\n(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud\nImam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«اشْهَدُوا»\n(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and I saw the mount between its two parts.\nThe Stubbornness of the idolators\nAllah said,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,\nيُعْرِضُواْ\n(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,\nوَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,\nوَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ\n(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,\nمَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ\n(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,\nحِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ\n(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,\nفَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ\n(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts. Who can guide such people after Allah This Ayah is similar to Allah's statements,\nقُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَـلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.\")(6:149) and,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)(10:101)"

To test and try the people of Thamud, Allah sent to them a superb, pregnant female camel that emerged from solid rock, according to their request, so that it would become a proof against them from Allah, the Exalted. Thereafter, they were supposed to believe in what was brought to them by Salih, peace be upon him. Allah ordered His servant and Messenger Salih,\nفَارْتَقِبْهُمْ وَاصْطَبِرْ\n(So watch them, and be patient!) Allah commanded, `await, O Salih, and see what will become of them and be patient; verily the better end will be yours and you will have success in this life and the Hereafter,'\nوَنَبِّئْهُمْ أَنَّ الْمَآءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ\n(And inform them that the water is to be shared between them) one day for her to drink and one day for them to drink,\nقَالَ هَـذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَّهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ\n(He said: \"Here is a she-camel: it has a right to drink, and you have a right to drink (water) on a day, known.\") (26:155) Allah's statement,\nكُلُّ شِرْبٍ مُّحْتَضَرٌ\n(each one's right to drink being established.) Mujahid said, \"When she did not drink, they would drink the water, and when she drank, they would drink her milk.\" Allah the Exalted said;\nفَنَادَوْاْ صَـحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَى فَعَقَرَ\n(But they called their comrade and he took and killed.) According to the Scholars of Tafsir, his name was Qudar bin Salif; he was the evilest among them,\nإِذِ انبَعَثَ أَشْقَـهَا\n(When the most wicked man among them went forth (to kill the she-camel).)(91:12) Allah said here,\nفَتَعَاطَى\n(and he took) meaning to harm,\nفَعَقَرَفَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ\n(and killed (her).

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon\nAllah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,\nأَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ\n(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),\nاقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ\n(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)\nHadiths about the Last Hour\nThere are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,\n«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»\n(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»\n(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»\n(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»\n(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,\nوَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split\nThe Narration of Anas bin Malik\nImam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.\nThe Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im\nImam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr\nAl-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,\n«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»\n(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud\nImam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«اشْهَدُوا»\n(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and I saw the mount between its two parts.\nThe Stubbornness of the idolators\nAllah said,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,\nيُعْرِضُواْ\n(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,\nوَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,\nوَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ\n(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,\nمَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ\n(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,\nحِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ\n(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,\nفَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ\n(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts. Who can guide such people after Allah This Ayah is similar to Allah's statements,\nقُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَـلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.\")(6:149) and,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)(10:101)"

      "text": "The Story of the People of the Prophet Lut\nAllah the Exalted states that the people of Lut defied and denied their Messenger and committed sodomy, the awful immoral sin that no people in the history of mankind had committed before. This is why Allah destroyed them with a type of torment that He never inflicted upon any nation before them. Allah the Exalted commanded Jibril, peace be upon him, to raise their cities to the sky and then turn them upside down over them, followed by stones made of marked Sijjil. So He said here:\nإِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حَـصِباً إِلاَّ آلَ لُوطٍ نَّجَّيْنَـهُم بِسَحَرٍ\n(Verily, We sent against them Hasib (a violent storm of stones) except the family of Lut, them We saved in the last hour of the night.) They left the city in the last part of the night and were saved from the torment that struck their people, none of whom believed in Lut. And even Lut's wife suffered the same end as her people. Allah's Prophet Lut left Sodom with his daughters in safety, unharmed. Allah said,\nكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى مَن شَكَرَوَلَقَدْ أَنذَرَهُمْ بَطْشَتَنَا\n(Thus do We reward him who gives thanks. And he indeed had warned them of Our punishment,) meaning, before the torment struck his people, he warned them of Allah's torment and punishment. They did not heed the warning, nor listen to Lut, but instead doubted and disputed the warning.\nوَلَقَدْ رَاوَدُوهُ عَن ضَيْفِهِ\n(And they indeed sought to shame his guests) that is the night the angels Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil came to him in the shape of handsome young men, as a test from Allah for Lut's people. Lut hosted his guests, while his wife, the evil old one, sent a message to her people informing them of Lut's guests. They came to him in haste from every direction, and Lut had to close the door in their faces. They came during the night and tried to break the door; Lut tried to fend them off, while shielding his guests from them, saying,\nهَـؤُلآءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ\n(These are my daughters, if you must act (so).) (15:71), in reference to their women,\nقَالُواْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِى بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ\n(They said: \"Surely, you know that we have neither any desire nor need of your daughters!\")(11:79), meaning, `we do not have any desire for women,'\nوَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ\n(and indeed you know well what we want!)(11:79) When the situation became serious and they insisted on coming in, Jibril went out to them and struck their eyes with the tip of his wing, causing them to lose their sight. They went back feeling for the walls to guide them, threatening Lut with what would befall him in the morning. Allah the Exalted said,\nوَلَقَدْ صَبَّحَهُم بُكْرَةً عَذَابٌ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.) meaning, a torment that they had no way of escaping or avoiding,\nفَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then taste you My torment and My warnings.

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon\nAllah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,\nأَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ\n(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),\nاقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ\n(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)\nHadiths about the Last Hour\nThere are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,\n«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»\n(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»\n(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»\n(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»\n(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,\nوَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split\nThe Narration of Anas bin Malik\nImam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.\nThe Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im\nImam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr\nAl-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,\n«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»\n(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud\nImam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«اشْهَدُوا»\n(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and I saw the mount between its two parts.\nThe Stubbornness of the idolators\nAllah said,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,\nيُعْرِضُواْ\n(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,\nوَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,\nوَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ\n(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,\nمَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ\n(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,\nحِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ\n(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,\nفَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ\n(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts. Who can guide such people after Allah This Ayah is similar to Allah's statements,\nقُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَـلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.\")(6:149) and,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)(10:101)"

      "text": "The Story of the People of the Prophet Lut\nAllah the Exalted states that the people of Lut defied and denied their Messenger and committed sodomy, the awful immoral sin that no people in the history of mankind had committed before. This is why Allah destroyed them with a type of torment that He never inflicted upon any nation before them. Allah the Exalted commanded Jibril, peace be upon him, to raise their cities to the sky and then turn them upside down over them, followed by stones made of marked Sijjil. So He said here:\nإِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حَـصِباً إِلاَّ آلَ لُوطٍ نَّجَّيْنَـهُم بِسَحَرٍ\n(Verily, We sent against them Hasib (a violent storm of stones) except the family of Lut, them We saved in the last hour of the night.) They left the city in the last part of the night and were saved from the torment that struck their people, none of whom believed in Lut. And even Lut's wife suffered the same end as her people. Allah's Prophet Lut left Sodom with his daughters in safety, unharmed. Allah said,\nكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى مَن شَكَرَوَلَقَدْ أَنذَرَهُمْ بَطْشَتَنَا\n(Thus do We reward him who gives thanks. And he indeed had warned them of Our punishment,) meaning, before the torment struck his people, he warned them of Allah's torment and punishment. They did not heed the warning, nor listen to Lut, but instead doubted and disputed the warning.\nوَلَقَدْ رَاوَدُوهُ عَن ضَيْفِهِ\n(And they indeed sought to shame his guests) that is the night the angels Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil came to him in the shape of handsome young men, as a test from Allah for Lut's people. Lut hosted his guests, while his wife, the evil old one, sent a message to her people informing them of Lut's guests. They came to him in haste from every direction, and Lut had to close the door in their faces. They came during the night and tried to break the door; Lut tried to fend them off, while shielding his guests from them, saying,\nهَـؤُلآءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ\n(These are my daughters, if you must act (so).) (15:71), in reference to their women,\nقَالُواْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِى بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ\n(They said: \"Surely, you know that we have neither any desire nor need of your daughters!\")(11:79), meaning, `we do not have any desire for women,'\nوَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ\n(and indeed you know well what we want!)(11:79) When the situation became serious and they insisted on coming in, Jibril went out to them and struck their eyes with the tip of his wing, causing them to lose their sight. They went back feeling for the walls to guide them, threatening Lut with what would befall him in the morning. Allah the Exalted said,\nوَلَقَدْ صَبَّحَهُم بُكْرَةً عَذَابٌ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.) meaning, a torment that they had no way of escaping or avoiding,\nفَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then taste you My torment and My warnings. And indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember)"

Advising and Threatening the Quraysh Allah said,\nأَكُفَّـرُكُمْ\n(Are your disbelievers) meaning, `O idolators of the Quraysh,'\nخَيْرٌ مِّنْ أُوْلَـئِكُمْ\n(better than these) meaning better than the nations that were mentioned here, who were destroyed on account of their disbelief in the Messengers and rejecting the Scriptures. `Are you better than these'\nأَمْ لَكُم بَرَآءَةٌ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(Or have you immunity in the Divine Scriptures), `do you have immunity from Allah that the torment and punishment will not touch you' Allah said about the Quraysh,\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ نَحْنُ جَمِيعٌ مُّنتَصِرٌ\n(Or say they: \"We are a great multitude, victorious\") stating that they believed they will support each other and their great gathering will avail them against those who intend to harm them. Allah the Exalted responded,\nسَيُهْزَمُ الْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ\n(Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.) affirming that their gathering shall scatter, and they shall be defeated. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Prophet , while in a dome-shaped tent on the day of the battle of Badr, said,\n«أَنْشُدُكَ عَهْدَكَ وَوَعْدَكَ، اللْهُمَّ إِنْ شِئْتَ لَمْ تُعْبَدْ بَعْدَ الْيَوْمِ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَبَدًا»\n(O Allah! I ask you for the fulfillment of Your covenant and promise. O Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers), You will never be worshipped on the earth after today.) Abu Bakr caught him by the hand and said, `This is sufficient, O Allah's Messenger! You have sufficiently asked and petitioned Allah.' The Prophet was clad in his armor at that time and went out, saying,\nسَيُهْزَمُ الْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ - بَلِ السَّاعَةُ مَوْعِدُهُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَى وَأَمَرُّ\n(Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.)\" Al-Bukhari also recorded that Yusuf bin Mahak said, \"I was with the Mother of the faithful, `A'ishah, when she said, `When I was still a young playful girl in Makkah, this Ayah was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ,\nبَلِ السَّاعَةُ مَوْعِدُهُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَى وَأَمَرُّ\n(Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.)\" This is the abridged narration that Al-Bukhari collected, but he also collected a longer narration of it in the Book of the Virtues of the Qur'an. Muslim did not collect this Hadith.\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ"

      "text": "The Destination of the Criminals\nAllah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,\nذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")\nEverything was created with Qadar\nAllah's statement,\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,\nوَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً\n(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,\nسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى\n(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,\n«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»\n(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»\n(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»\n(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»\n(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»\n(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,\nوَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ\n(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"\nA Warning to beware of Allah's Threats\nAllah said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ\n(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»\n(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,\nفِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ\n(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,\nعِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ\n(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,\n«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»\n(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.\nThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him."

Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»\n(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,\nفِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ\n(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,\nعِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ\n(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,\n«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»\n(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.\nThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him."

      "text": "The Destination of the Criminals\nAllah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,\nذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")\nEverything was created with Qadar\nAllah's statement,\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,\nوَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً\n(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,\nسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى\n(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,\n«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»\n(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»\n(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»\n(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»\n(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»\n(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,\nوَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ\n(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"\nA Warning to beware of Allah's Threats\nAllah said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ\n(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted.

Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened.

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon\nAllah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,\nأَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ\n(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),\nاقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ\n(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)\nHadiths about the Last Hour\nThere are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,\n«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»\n(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»\n(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»\n(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»\n(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,\nوَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split\nThe Narration of Anas bin Malik\nImam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.\nThe Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im\nImam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas\nAl-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr\nAl-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:\nاقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ\n(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,\n«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»\n(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"\nThe Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud\nImam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«اشْهَدُوا»\n(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and I saw the mount between its two parts.\nThe Stubbornness of the idolators\nAllah said,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,\nيُعْرِضُواْ\n(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,\nوَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ\n(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,\nوَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,\nوَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ\n(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ\n(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,\nمَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ\n(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,\nحِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ\n(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,\nفَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ\n(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts. Who can guide such people after Allah This Ayah is similar to Allah's statements,\nقُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَـلِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.\")(6:149) and,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)(10:101)"

Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,\n«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»\n(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»\n(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»\n(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»\n(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»\n(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,\nوَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ\n(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"\nA Warning to beware of Allah's Threats\nAllah said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ\n(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»\n(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,\nفِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ\n(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,\nعِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ\n(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,\n«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»\n(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.\nThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him."

They will be admonished and criticized,\nذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")\nEverything was created with Qadar\nAllah's statement,\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,\nوَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً\n(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,\nسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى\n(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,\n«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»\n(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»\n(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»\n(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»\n(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»\n(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,\nوَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ\n(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"\nA Warning to beware of Allah's Threats\nAllah said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ\n(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»\n(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,\nفِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ\n(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,\nعِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ\n(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,\n«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»\n(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.\nThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him."

(25:2) and,\nسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى\n(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,\nإِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ\nإِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,\n«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»\n(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,\nيَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ\n(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»\n(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»\n(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»\n(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»\n(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»\n(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,\nوَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ\n(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"\nA Warning to beware of Allah's Threats\nAllah said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ\n(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ\n(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them\nوَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ\n(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ\n(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,\nوَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ\n(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,\nمُّسْتَطَرٌ\n(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»\n(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.\nThe Good End for Those with Taqwa\nAllah said,\nإِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ\n(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,\nفِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ\n(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,\nعِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ\n(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,\n«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»\n(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.\nThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar).

      "text": "The Story of the People of Nuh and the Lesson from it\nAllah the Exalted said,\nكَذَّبَتْ\n(denied) `before your people, O Muhammad,'\nقَوْمُ نُوحٍ فَكَذَّبُواْ عَبْدَنَا\n(the people of Nuh. They rejected Our servant) means, they denied him categorically and accused him of madness,\nوَقَالُواْ مَجْنُونٌ وَازْدُجِرَ\n(and said: \"A madman!\" Wazdujir.) Mujahid said about Wazdujir: \"He was driven out accused on account of madness.\" It was also said that Wazdujir means, he was rebuked, deterred, threatened and warned by his people saying:\nلَئِنْ لَّمْ تَنْتَهِ ينُوحُ لَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُرْجُومِينَ\n(\"If you do not stop O Nuh, you will be among those who will be stoned.\") 26:116 This was said by Ibn Zayd, and it is sound.\nفَدَعَا رَبَّهُ أَنُّى مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ\n(Then he invoked his Lord (saying): \"I have been overcome, so help (me)!\") meaning, `I am weak and cannot overcome or resist my people, so help Your religion!' Allah the Exalted said,\nفَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَبَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ\n(So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir.) As-Suddi said about Munhamir, \"It means abundant.\"\nوَفَجَّرْنَا الاٌّرْضَ عُيُوناً\n(And We caused springs to gush forth from the earth.) means, from every part of the earth, and even ovens in which fire was burning -- water and springs gushed forth,\nفَالْتَقَى المَآءُ\n(So, the waters met), means, of the heaven and the earth,\nعَلَى أَمْرٍ قَدْ قُدِرَ\n(for a matter predestined.) Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas:\nفَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَبَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ\n(So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir), Torrential rain, the only water that fell from the sky before that day and ever since was from clouds. But the sky's gates were opened on them that day, and therefore, the water that came down was not from clouds. So both the waters (of the earth and the heaven) met according to a matter ordained.\" Allah said,\nوَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَى ذَاتِ أَلْوَحٍ وَدُسُرٍ\n(And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails (Dusur)), Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Dusur means nails. Ibn Jarir preferred this view. Allah's statement,\nتَجْرِى بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(Floating under Our Eyes), means, `by Our command and under Our protection and observation,'\nجَزَآءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ\n(a reward for him who had been rejected!) meaning, as recompense for them because of their disbelief in Allah and as reward for Nuh, peace be upon him. Allah the Exalted said,\nوَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَـهَا ءايَةً\n(And indeed, We have left this as a sign.) Qatadah said, \"Allah left the ship of Nuh intact until the first generation of this Ummah were able to see it.\" However, it appears that the meaning here is that Allah kept ships as a sign. For instance, Allah the Exalted said,\nوَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ - وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ\n(And a sign for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship. And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.)(36:41-42),\nإِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ\n(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)(69:11-12) Allah's statement here,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember) means, `is there any that will receive admonition and reminder. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Prophet recited to me,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Al-Bukhari collected a similar Hadith from `Abdullah that he said, \"I recited to the Prophet (فَهَلْ مِن مُّذَّكِرٍ) (then is there any that will remember) and the Prophet said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(Then is there any that will remember)\" Allah's statement,\nفَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ\n(Then how (terrible) was My torment and My warnings) means, `how terrible was My torment that I inflicted on those who disbelieved in Me and denied My Messengers, who did not heed to My warnings How was My help that I extended to My Messengers and the revenge exerted on their behalf,'\nوَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ\n(And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember); meaning, `We have made the Qur'an easy to recite and comprehend for those who seek these traits, to remind mankind,' as Allah said,\nكِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَـرَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُواْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُوْلُو الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n((This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.)(38:29),\nفَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ بِلَسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(So We have made this (the Qur'an) easy in your own tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.)(19:97) Allah said,\nفَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ\n(then is there any that will remember), meaning, `is there anyone who will remember through this Qur'an, which We made easy to memorize and easy to understand' Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi commented on this Ayah, \"Is there anyone who will avoid evil\""
