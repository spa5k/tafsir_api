A revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) means, the Qur'an is revealed from the Most Gracious, Most Merciful. This is like the Ayat:\nقُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ الْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Say Ruh Al-Qudus (Jibril) has brought it down from your Lord with truth) (16:102).\nوَإِنَّهُ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ - عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ\n(And truly, this is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down upon your heart that you may be (one) of the warners.) (26:192-194).\nكِتَـبٌ فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَـتُهُ\n(A Book whereof the Ayat are explained in detail) means, its meanings are clear and its rulings are sound and wise.\nقُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً\n(a Qur'an in Arabic) means, because it is a clear Arabic Qur'an, its meanings are precise and detailed and its words are clear and not confusing. This is like the Ayah:\nكِتَابٌ أُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ\n((This is) a Book, the Ayat whereof are completed, and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise Well-Acquainted) (11:1). meaning, it is miraculous in its wording and in its meanings.\nلاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ\n(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.) (41:42).\nلِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(for people who know.) means, this clear style will be readily understood by scholars who are thoroughly versed in knowledge.\nبَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً\n(Giving glad tidings and warning,) means, sometimes it brings glad tidings to the believers, and sometimes it brings a warning to the disbelievers.\nفَأَعْرَضَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ\n(but most of them turn away, so they hear not.) means, most of the Quraysh did not understand anything of it at all, despite the fact that it was so clear.\nوَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا فِى أَكِنَّةٍ\n(And they say: \"Our hearts are under coverings...\") meaning, they are wrapped and screened,\nمِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ وَفِى ءَاذانِنَا وَقْرٌ\n(from that to which you invite us; and in our ears is deafness,) means, `we are deaf to the message you bring to us.'\nوَمِن بَيْنِنَا وَبَيْنِكَ حِجَابٌ\n(and between us and you is a screen,) `so nothing of what you say reaches us.'\nفَاعْمَلْ إِنَّنَا عَـمِلُونَ\n(so work you (on your way); verily, we are working) means, go your way, and we will go our way, and we will not follow you."

      "text": "Some Details of the Creation of this Universe Here\nAllah denounces the idolators who worship other gods apart from Him although He is the Creator, Subduer and Controller of all things. He says:\nقُلْ أَءِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِى خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ وَتَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ أَندَاداً\n(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days And you set up rivals with Him\") meaning, `false gods whom you worship alongside Him'\nذَلِكَ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That is the Lord of the that exists.) the Creator of all things is the Lord of all the creatures. Here the Ayah;\nخَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ\n(Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days) (7:54). is explained in more detail; the creation of the earth and the creation of the heaven are discussed separately. Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:\nهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَاتٍ\n(He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth. Then He rose over (Istawa ila) the heaven and made them seven heavens) (2:29). With regard to the Ayat:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا - وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا - مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed He raised its height, and has perfected it. Its night He covers with darkness and its forenoon He brings out (with light). And after that He spread the earth, And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly, (to be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) (79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something. And Allah says:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed) until;\nوَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا\n(And after that He spread the earth.) (79:27-30) So He mentioned the creation of the heavens before the earth, then He said:\nقُلْ أَءِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِى خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days...\") until;\nطَآئِعِينَ\n(We come willingly.) Here He mentioned the creation of the earth before the creation of the heavens. And He says:\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23).\nعَزِيزاً حَكِيماً\n(Most Powerful, All-Wise) (4:56).\nسَمِيعاً بَصِيراً\n(All-Hearer, All-Seer) (4:58). It is as if He was and is no longer.' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, replied:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101), this will happen when the Trumpet is blown for the first time.\nفَصَعِقَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ اللَّهُ\n(And all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills) (39:68), and at that time there will be no kinship among them, nor will they ask of one another. Then when the Sur will be blown again,\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27). With regard to the Ayat,\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) and\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42), Allah will forgive the sincere believers their sins, then the idolators will say, `Let us say that we never joined others in worship with Allah.' Then a seal will be placed over their mouths, and their hands will speak. Then it will be known that not a single fact can be hidden from Allah, and at that point,\nيَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(those who disbelieved will wish) (4:42). Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:\nدَحَـهَا\n((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23). This is how He described Himself, and this is how He still is. Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, so do not be confused about the Qur'an, for all of it comes from Allah.\"' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari.\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) means, on Sunday and Monday.\nوَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِىَ مِن فَوْقِهَا وَبَـرَكَ فِيهَا\n(He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it,) means, He blessed it and gave it the potential to be planted with seeds and bring forth produce.\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(And measured therein its sustenance) means, what its people need of provision and places in which to plant things and grow crops. This was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which together with the two previous days add up to four days.\nفِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(in four Days equal for all those who ask.) meaning, for those who want to ask about that, so that they might know. `Ikrimah and Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(and measured therein its sustenance): \"He placed in every land that which is not suited for any other land.\" Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, concerning the Ayah,\nسَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(equal for all those who ask): this means, \"For whoever wants to ask about that.\" Ibn Zayd said:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا فِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask. ) \"According to whatever a person who is need of provision wants, Allah measures out for him what he needs.\" This is like what they said concerning the Ayah:\nوَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ\n(And He gave you of all that you asked for) (14:34). And Allah knows best.\nثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ وَهِىَ دُخَانٌ\n(Then He rose over (Istawa ila) towards the heaven when it was smoke,) i.e., steam which arose from it when the earth was created.\nفَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلاٌّرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً\n(and said to it and to the earth: \"Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.\") meaning, `respond to My command and be subjected to this action, willingly or unwillingly.'\nقَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ\n(They both said: \"We come willingly.\") meaning, `we will respond to You willingly and everything that You want to create in us -- angels, Jinn and men -- will all be obedient to You.'\nفَقَضَاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Then He completed and finished their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days) means, He finished forming them as seven heavens in two more days, which were Thursday and Friday.\nوَأَوْحَى فِى كُلِّ سَمَآءٍ أَمْرَهَا\n(and He decreed in each heaven its affair. ) means, He placed in each heaven whatever it needs of angels and things which are known only unto Him.\nوَزَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ\n(And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps) means, the stars and planets which shine on the people of the earth.\nوَحِفْظاً\n(as well as to guard.) means, as protection against the Shayatin, lest they listen to the angels on high.\nذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ\n(Such is the Decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower) means, the Almighty Who has subjugated all things to His control, the All-Knower Who knows all the movements of His creatures."

Here the Ayah;\nخَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ\n(Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days) (7:54). is explained in more detail; the creation of the earth and the creation of the heaven are discussed separately. Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:\nهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَاتٍ\n(He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth. Then He rose over (Istawa ila) the heaven and made them seven heavens) (2:29). With regard to the Ayat:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا - وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا - مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed He raised its height, and has perfected it. Its night He covers with darkness and its forenoon He brings out (with light). And after that He spread the earth, And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly, (to be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) (79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something. And Allah says:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed) until;\nوَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا\n(And after that He spread the earth.) (79:27-30) So He mentioned the creation of the heavens before the earth, then He said:\nقُلْ أَءِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِى خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days...\") until;\nطَآئِعِينَ\n(We come willingly.) Here He mentioned the creation of the earth before the creation of the heavens. And He says:\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23).\nعَزِيزاً حَكِيماً\n(Most Powerful, All-Wise) (4:56).\nسَمِيعاً بَصِيراً\n(All-Hearer, All-Seer) (4:58). It is as if He was and is no longer.' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, replied:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101), this will happen when the Trumpet is blown for the first time.\nفَصَعِقَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ اللَّهُ\n(And all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills) (39:68), and at that time there will be no kinship among them, nor will they ask of one another. Then when the Sur will be blown again,\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27). With regard to the Ayat,\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) and\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42), Allah will forgive the sincere believers their sins, then the idolators will say, `Let us say that we never joined others in worship with Allah.' Then a seal will be placed over their mouths, and their hands will speak. Then it will be known that not a single fact can be hidden from Allah, and at that point,\nيَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(those who disbelieved will wish) (4:42). Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:\nدَحَـهَا\n((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23). This is how He described Himself, and this is how He still is. Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, so do not be confused about the Qur'an, for all of it comes from Allah.\"' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari.\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) means, on Sunday and Monday.\nوَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِىَ مِن فَوْقِهَا وَبَـرَكَ فِيهَا\n(He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it,) means, He blessed it and gave it the potential to be planted with seeds and bring forth produce.\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(And measured therein its sustenance) means, what its people need of provision and places in which to plant things and grow crops. This was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which together with the two previous days add up to four days.\nفِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(in four Days equal for all those who ask.) meaning, for those who want to ask about that, so that they might know. `Ikrimah and Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(and measured therein its sustenance): \"He placed in every land that which is not suited for any other land.\" Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, concerning the Ayah,\nسَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(equal for all those who ask): this means, \"For whoever wants to ask about that.\" Ibn Zayd said:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا فِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask. ) \"According to whatever a person who is need of provision wants, Allah measures out for him what he needs.\" This is like what they said concerning the Ayah:\nوَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ\n(And He gave you of all that you asked for) (14:34). And Allah knows best.\nثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ وَهِىَ دُخَانٌ\n(Then He rose over (Istawa ila) towards the heaven when it was smoke,) i.e., steam which arose from it when the earth was created.\nفَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلاٌّرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً\n(and said to it and to the earth: \"Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.\") meaning, `respond to My command and be subjected to this action, willingly or unwillingly.'\nقَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ\n(They both said: \"We come willingly.\") meaning, `we will respond to You willingly and everything that You want to create in us -- angels, Jinn and men -- will all be obedient to You.'\nفَقَضَاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Then He completed and finished their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days) means, He finished forming them as seven heavens in two more days, which were Thursday and Friday.\nوَأَوْحَى فِى كُلِّ سَمَآءٍ أَمْرَهَا\n(and He decreed in each heaven its affair. ) means, He placed in each heaven whatever it needs of angels and things which are known only unto Him.\nوَزَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ\n(And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps) means, the stars and planets which shine on the people of the earth.\nوَحِفْظاً\n(as well as to guard.) means, as protection against the Shayatin, lest they listen to the angels on high.\nذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ\n(Such is the Decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower) means, the Almighty Who has subjugated all things to His control, the All-Knower Who knows all the movements of His creatures."

And surely, there have passed away warners before him and after him) (46:21). which means that in the neighboring towns and cities, Allah sent Messengers who commanded the people to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they brought good news as well as warnings. They saw the punishment Allah sent upon His enemies, and the blessings which He bestowed upon His friends, yet despite all of this, they did not believe in them. On the contrary, they denied them and rejected them, and said:\nلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّنَا لاّنزَلَ مَلَـئِكَةً\n(If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels.) meaning, if Allah were to send Messengers, they would be angels sent from His presence.\nفَإِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ\n(So, indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.) means, `because you are a mere human; we will not follow you because you are just men like us.'\nفَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ\n(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right.) means, they were arrogant, stubborn and disobedient.\nوَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً\n(and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\") They boasted of their physical strength, and power; they thought that this would protect them from Allah's punishment.\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً\n(See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them.) means, do they not realize, when they are showing enmity, that He is the Almighty Who created all things and gave them whatever strength they have, and that His onslaught will be far greater This is like the Ayah:\nوَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ\n(With Hands did We construct the heaven. Verily, We are able to extend the vastness of space thereof.) (51:47) They openly opposed the Almighty and denied His signs and disobeyed His Messenger.

It was also said that it is the wind that makes a noise. The truth that it was all of these things, for it was a strong wind that was an apt punishment for their being deceived by their physical strength. It was also intensely cold, as Allah says:\nبِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ\n(with a Sarsar wind!) (69:6), meaning a very cold wind. It also made a furious sound. Additionally, there is a famous river in the east which is called Sarsar because of the noise it makes as it flows.\nفِى أَيَّامٍ نَّحِسَاتٍ\n(in days of calamity) means, consecutive days.\nسَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَـنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُوماً\n(seven nights and eight days in succession) (69: 7). This is like the Ayah:\nفِى يَوْمِ نَحْسٍ مُّسْتَمِرٍّ\n(on a day of calamity, continuous) (54:19) i.e., the punishment began on a day which was of evil omen for them, and this evil omen continued for them,\nسَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَـنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُوماً\n(seven nights and eight days in succession) (69:7) until they were destroyed, every last one of them, and their humiliation in this world was joined to their punishment in the Hereafter.

On the contrary, they denied them and rejected them, and said:\nلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّنَا لاّنزَلَ مَلَـئِكَةً\n(If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels.) meaning, if Allah were to send Messengers, they would be angels sent from His presence.\nفَإِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ\n(So, indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.) means, `because you are a mere human; we will not follow you because you are just men like us.'\nفَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ\n(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right.) means, they were arrogant, stubborn and disobedient.\nوَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً\n(and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\") They boasted of their physical strength, and power; they thought that this would protect them from Allah's punishment.\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً\n(See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them.) means, do they not realize, when they are showing enmity, that He is the Almighty Who created all things and gave them whatever strength they have, and that His onslaught will be far greater This is like the Ayah:\nوَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ\n(With Hands did We construct the heaven.

It was also intensely cold, as Allah says:\nبِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ\n(with a Sarsar wind!) (69:6), meaning a very cold wind. It also made a furious sound.

Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar narrated that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ laughed and smiled one day, and said:\n«أَلَا تَسْأَلُونِّي عَنْ أَيِّ شَيْءٍ ضَحِكْتُ؟»\n(Will you not ask about why I laughed)\" They said, \"O Messenger of Allah, why did you laugh\" He said:\n«عَجِبْتُ مِنْ مُجَادَلَةِ الْعَبْدِ رَبَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَقُولُ: أَيْ رَبِّي أَلَيْسَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنْ لَا تَظْلِمَنِي، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَيَقُولُ: فَإِنِّي لَا أَقْبَلُ عَلَيَّ شَاهِدًا إِلَّا مِنْ نَفْسِي، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى: أَوَلَيْسَ كَفَى بِي شَهِيدًا وَبِالْمَلَائِكَةِ الْكِرَام الْكَاتِبِينَ قال : فَيُرَدِّدُ هذَا الْكَلَامَ مِرَارًا قال : فَيُخْتَمُ عَلى فِيهِ وَتَتَكَلَّمُ أَرْكَانُهُ بِمَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ، فَيَقُولُ: بُعْدًا لَكُنَّ وَسُحْقًا، عَنْكُنَّ كُنْتُ أُجَادِل»\n(I was amazed at how a servant will dispute with his Lord on the Day of Resurrection. He will say, \"My Lord, did You not promise me that you would not treat me unjustly\" Allah will say, \"Yes.\" The man will say, \"I will not accept any witness against me except from myself.\" Allah will say, \"Is it not sufficient that I and the angels, the noble scribes, are witnesses\" These words will be repeated several times, then a seal will be placed over his mouth and his organs (or limbs) will speak about what he used to do. Then he will say, \"Away with you! It was only for your sake that I was arguing!\")\" It was recorded by him and Ibn Abi Hatim. It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Burdah said that Abu Musa said, \"The disbeliever or the hypocrite will be called to account and his Lord will show him his deeds, but he will deny them and say, `O Lord, by Your glory, this angel has written about me something that I did not do.' The angel will say to him, `Did you not do such and such on such and such a day in such and such a place' He will say, `No, by Your glory O Lord, I did not do it.' When he does that, a seal will be placed over his mouth.\" Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I think that the first part of his body to speak will be his right thigh.\" Allah's saying:\nوَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُكُمْ وَلاَ جُلُودُكُمْ\n(And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you;) means, their organs and skins will say to them, when they blame them for testifying against them, `you did not hide from us what you used to do, on the contrary, you openly committed disbelief and sin, and you claimed that you did not care, because you did not believe that Allah knew about all your deeds.' Allah says:\nوَلَـكِن ظَنَنتُمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَعْلَمُ كَثِيراً مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَوَذَلِكُمْ ظَنُّكُمُ الَّذِى ظَنَنتُم بِرَبِّكُمْ أَرْدَاكُمْ\n(but you thought that Allah knew not much of what you were doing. And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction;) meaning, `this evil thought, i.e., your belief that Allah did not know much of what you were doing, is what has caused you to be doomed and has made your losers before your Lord.'\nفَأَصْبَحْتُمْ مِّنَ الُخَـسِرِينَ\n(and you have become of those utterly lost!) means, `in the place of Resurrection, you have lost your own selves and your families.' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I was hiding beneath the covering of the Ka`bah, and three men came along -- a man from the Quraysh and two of his brothers-in-law from Thaqif, or a man from Thaqif and two of his brothers-in-law from the Quraysh. Their bellies were very fat, and did not have much understanding. They said some words I could not hear, then one of them said, `Do you think that Allah can hear what we are saying now' The other said, `If we raise our voices, He will hear it, but if we do not raise our voices, He will not hear it.' The other said, `If He can hear one thing from us, He can hear everything.' I mentioned this to the Prophet , then Allah revealed the words:\nوَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُكُمْ وَلاَ جُلُودُكُمْ\n(And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you) until;\nمِّنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ\n(of those utterly lost!) This is how it was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain).\nفَإِن يَصْبِرُواْ فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ\n(Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.) means, whether they bear it patiently or not, they are in the Fire and they will have no escape or way out from it, and even if they try to please Allah and offer excuses, nothing of that will be accepted from them. Ibn Jarir said, \"The meaning of the Ayah,\nوَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ\n(and if they seek to please Allah,) is: They will ask to go back to this world, but this plea will not be answered. This is like the Ayah:\nقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ - قَالَ اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ\n(They will say: \"Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.\" He will say: \"Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!\")\" (23:106-108)."

(26:192-194).\nكِتَـبٌ فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَـتُهُ\n(A Book whereof the Ayat are explained in detail) means, its meanings are clear and its rulings are sound and wise.\nقُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً\n(a Qur'an in Arabic) means, because it is a clear Arabic Qur'an, its meanings are precise and detailed and its words are clear and not confusing.

(41:42).\nلِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(for people who know.) means, this clear style will be readily understood by scholars who are thoroughly versed in knowledge.\nبَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً\n(Giving glad tidings and warning,) means, sometimes it brings glad tidings to the believers, and sometimes it brings a warning to the disbelievers.\nفَأَعْرَضَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ\n(but most of them turn away, so they hear not.) means, most of the Quraysh did not understand anything of it at all, despite the fact that it was so clear.\nوَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا فِى أَكِنَّةٍ\n(And they say: \"Our hearts are under coverings...\") meaning, they are wrapped and screened,\nمِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ وَفِى ءَاذانِنَا وَقْرٌ\n(from that to which you invite us; and in our ears is deafness,) means, `we are deaf to the message you bring to us.'\nوَمِن بَيْنِنَا وَبَيْنِكَ حِجَابٌ\n(and between us and you is a screen,) `so nothing of what you say reaches us.'\nفَاعْمَلْ إِنَّنَا عَـمِلُونَ\n(so work you (on your way); verily, we are working) means, go your way, and we will go our way, and we will not follow you."

They said some words I could not hear, then one of them said, `Do you think that Allah can hear what we are saying now' The other said, `If we raise our voices, He will hear it, but if we do not raise our voices, He will not hear it.' The other said, `If He can hear one thing from us, He can hear everything.' I mentioned this to the Prophet , then Allah revealed the words:\nوَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُكُمْ وَلاَ جُلُودُكُمْ\n(And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you) until;\nمِّنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ\n(of those utterly lost!) This is how it was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain).\nفَإِن يَصْبِرُواْ فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ\n(Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.) means, whether they bear it patiently or not, they are in the Fire and they will have no escape or way out from it, and even if they try to please Allah and offer excuses, nothing of that will be accepted from them. Ibn Jarir said, \"The meaning of the Ayah,\nوَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ\n(and if they seek to please Allah,) is: They will ask to go back to this world, but this plea will not be answered. This is like the Ayah:\nقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ - قَالَ اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ\n(They will say: \"Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.\" He will say: \"Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!\")\" (23:106-108)."

A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain).\nفَإِن يَصْبِرُواْ فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ\n(Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.) means, whether they bear it patiently or not, they are in the Fire and they will have no escape or way out from it, and even if they try to please Allah and offer excuses, nothing of that will be accepted from them. Ibn Jarir said, \"The meaning of the Ayah,\nوَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ\n(and if they seek to please Allah,) is: They will ask to go back to this world, but this plea will not be answered. This is like the Ayah:\nقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ - قَالَ اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ\n(They will say: \"Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.\" He will say: \"Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!\")\" (23:106-108)."

Allah commanded us to be different from that, and said:\nوَإِذَا قُرِىءَ الْقُرْءَانُ فَاسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ وَأَنصِتُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ\n(So, when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.)

Then Allah says:\nفَلَنُذِيقَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً\n(But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, ) meaning, in return for what they do when they hear the Qur'an.\nوَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَسْوَأَ الَّذِى كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.) means, for their evil deeds.\nذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ أَعْدَآءِ اللَّهِ النَّارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا دَارُ الخُلْدِ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُوا بِـَايـتِنَا يَجْحَدُون - وَقَال الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَرِنَا اللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّـنَا مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ نَجْعَلْهُمَا تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِنَا لِيَكُونَا مِنَ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ\n(That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire.

So Iblis is the one who calls people to every evil thing, such as Shirk and lesser sins.\" As for the first son of Adam, it is as confirmed in the Hadith:\n«مَا قُتِلَتْ نَفْسٌ ظُلْمًا إِلَّا كَانَ عَلَى ابْنِ آدَمَ الْأَوَّلِ كِفْلٌ مِنْ دَمِهَا،لِأَنَّهُ أَوَّلُ مَنْ سَنَّ الْقَتْل»\n(No soul is wrongfully killed, but a share of the burden of that sin will be upon the first son of Adam, because he was the first one who set the precedent of killing another.)\nنَجْعَلْهُمَا تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِنَا\n(that we may crush them under our feet) means, `make them beneath us in the torment, so that they will be punished more severely than us.'\nلِيَكُونَا مِنَ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ\n(so that they become the lowest.) means, in the lowest level of Hell, as already mentioned in Al-A`raf, where the followers ask Allah to multiply the torment for their leaders:\nقَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَعْلَمُونَ\n((Allah) said: \"For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.\") (7:38) i.e., Allah will give each of them the torment and punishment they deserve for their deeds.

This is like the Ayah:\nالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يُفْسِدُونَ\n(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption.)

He isthe All-Wise in His actions, when He appoints for them closecompanions from among the devils of men and Jinn.\nفَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ\n(who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them.) means, they made their deeds attractive to them in the past. As far as the future is concerned, they only see themselves as doing good, as Allah says:\nوَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ - وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ\n(And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Shaytan to be a companion for him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!) (43:36-37)\nوَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ\n(And the Word is justified against them) means, the Word of torment, just as it was justified against the nations of the past who did what they did, men and Jinn alike.\nإِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَـسِرِينَ\n(Indeed they (all) were the losers.) means, they are all equal in terms of loss and being doomed.\nHow the disbelievers advised One Another not to listen to the Qur'an, and the Recompense for that\nوَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَسْمَعُواْ لِهَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ\n(And those who disbelieve say: \"Listen not to this Qur'an...\") means, they advised one another not to pay heed to the Qur'an or obey its commands.\nوَالْغَوْاْ فِيهِ\n(and make noise in the midst of its) means, when it is recited, do not listen to it. This was the view of Mujahid. \"And make noise in the midst of its (recitation)\" means whistling and trying to make the Messenger of Allah ﷺ confused when he recited Qur'an, which is what the Quraysh did.\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ\n(that you may overcome.) means, this is the practice of these ignorant disbelievers and those who follow in their footsteps, when they hear the Qur'an. Allah commanded us to be different from that, and said:\nوَإِذَا قُرِىءَ الْقُرْءَانُ فَاسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ وَأَنصِتُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ\n(So, when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.) (7:204). Then Allah says:\nفَلَنُذِيقَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً\n(But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, ) meaning, in return for what they do when they hear the Qur'an.\nوَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَسْوَأَ الَّذِى كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.) means, for their evil deeds.\nذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ أَعْدَآءِ اللَّهِ النَّارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا دَارُ الخُلْدِ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُوا بِـَايـتِنَا يَجْحَدُون - وَقَال الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَرِنَا اللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّـنَا مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ نَجْعَلْهُمَا تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِنَا لِيَكُونَا مِنَ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ\n(That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a recompense for that they used to deny Our Ayat. And those who disbelieve will say: \"Our Lord! Show us those among Jinn and men who led us astray, that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest.\") It was reported that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said, concerning the phrase,\nاللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّـنَا\n(those who led us astray): \"Iblis and the son of Adam who killed his brother.\" As-Suddi reported that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"Iblis is followed by everyone who commits Shirk and the son of Adam is followed by everyone who commits a major sin.

This is like what is said in the Hadith narrated by Al-Bara', may Allah be pleased with him:\n«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَقُولُ لِرُوحِ الْمُؤْمِنِ: اخْرُجِي أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّـبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَهُ، اخْرُجِي إِلى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»\n(The angels say to the soul of the believer, \"Come out, O good soul from the good body in which you used to dwell, come out to rest, and provision and a Lord Who is not angry.\") It was said that the angels will come down to them on the Day when they are brought out of their graves. Zayd bin Aslam said, \"They will give him glad tidings when he dies, in his grave, and when he is resurrected.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim, and this view reconciles all the opinions; it is a good view and it is true.\nنَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. ) means, the angels will say to the believers when death approaches: \"We have been your friends, i.e., your close companions, in this world, protecting you and helping you by the command of Allah, and we will be with you in the Hereafter, keeping you from feeling lonely in your graves and when the Trumpet is blown; we will reassure you on the Day of Resurrection and will take you across the Sirat and bring you to the Gardens of delight.\"\nوَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ\n(Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire,) means, `in Paradise you will have all that you wish for and that will delight you.'\nوَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ\n(and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask.) means, `whatever you ask for, it will appear before you as you wish it to be.'\nنُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ\n(An entertainment from the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) means, `a welcoming gift and a blessing from the One Who has forgiven your sins and Who is Merciful and Kind towards you, Who has forgiven you, concealed your faults and been Kind and Merciful.'"

He is not one of those who enjoin good but do not do it themselves, or who forbid evil yet they do it themselves. He does good and avoids doing evil, and he calls people to their Creator, may He be blessed and exalted. This is general in meaning and applies to everyone who calls people to what is good and is himself guided by what he says. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ is the foremost among people in this regard, as Muhammad bin Sirin, As-Suddi and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said. It was also said that what was meant here is the righteous Mu'adhdhin, as it was mentioned in Sahih Muslim:\n«الْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The Mu'adhdhins will be the ones with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.)\" In As-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet said:\n«الْإِمَامُ ضَامِنٌ، وَالْمُؤَذِّنُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ، فَأَرْشَدَ اللهُ الْأَئِمَّةَ وَغَفَرَ لِلْمُؤَذِّنِين»\n(The Imam is a guarantor and the Mu'adhdhin is in a position of trust. May Allah guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhin.)\" The correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, and includes the Mu'adhdhin and others. When this Ayah was revealed, the Adhan had not been prescribed at all. The Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and the Adhan was prescribed in Al-Madinah after the Hijrah, when it was shown to `Abdullah bin `Abd Rabbihi Al-Ansari in a dream. He told the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it, and he told him to teach it to Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him, who had a more beautiful voice, as we have discussed elsewhere. So the correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, as `Abdur-Razzaq said, narrating from Ma`mar, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, who recited this Ayah:\nوَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\") and said, \"This is the beloved of Allah, this is the close friend of Allah, this is the chosen one of Allah, this is the most beloved of the all the people of earth to Allah. He responded to the call of Allah and called mankind to that to which he had responded. He did righteous deeds in response and said, `I am one of the Muslims.' This is Allah's Khalifah.\"\nWisdom in Da`wah etc\nوَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ\n(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal.) means, there is a huge difference between them.\nادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ\n(Repel (the evil) with one which is better,) means, `when someone does you wrong, repel him by treating him well,' as `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"There is no better punishment for one who has disobeyed Allah with regard to you, than your obeying Allah with regard to him.\"\nفَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ\n(then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.) means, `if you treat well those who treat you badly, this good deed will lead to reconciliation, love and empathy, and it will be as if he is a close friend to you and he will feel pity for you and be kind to you.' Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ\n(But none is granted it except those who are patient) meaning, no one accepts this advice and works according to it, except for those who can be patient in doing so, for it is difficult for people to do.\nوَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ\n(and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, the one who has a great portion of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas explained this Ayah: \"Allah commands the believers to be patient when they feel angry, to be forbearing when confronted with ignorance, and to forgive when they are mistreated. If they do this, Allah will save them from the Shaytan and subdue their enemies to them until they become like close friends.\"\nوَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ\n(And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah.) means, the devils among men may be deceived by your kind treatment of him, but the devils among the Jinn, when they insinuate their evil whispers, cannot be dealt with except by seeking refuge with the Creator Who gave him power over you. If you seek refuge with Allah and turn to Him, He will stop him from harming you and bring his efforts to naught. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up to pray, he would say:\n«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ، مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِه»\n(I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan and his evil insinuations, breath and impurity.)\" We have already stated that there is nothing like this in the Qur'an, apart from the passage in Surat Al-A`raf, where Allah says:\nخُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِض عَنِ الْجَـهِلِينَ - وَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ\n(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish. And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower.) (7:199-200) and the passage in Surat Al-Mu'minun where Allah says:\nادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيـطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ\n(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: \"My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin. And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.\") (23:96-98)\nوَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ - فَإِنِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَالَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْـَمُونَ"

It was also said that what was meant here is the righteous Mu'adhdhin, as it was mentioned in Sahih Muslim:\n«الْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(The Mu'adhdhins will be the ones with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.)\" In As-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet said:\n«الْإِمَامُ ضَامِنٌ، وَالْمُؤَذِّنُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ، فَأَرْشَدَ اللهُ الْأَئِمَّةَ وَغَفَرَ لِلْمُؤَذِّنِين»\n(The Imam is a guarantor and the Mu'adhdhin is in a position of trust. May Allah guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhin.)\" The correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, and includes the Mu'adhdhin and others. When this Ayah was revealed, the Adhan had not been prescribed at all. The Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and the Adhan was prescribed in Al-Madinah after the Hijrah, when it was shown to `Abdullah bin `Abd Rabbihi Al-Ansari in a dream. He told the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it, and he told him to teach it to Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him, who had a more beautiful voice, as we have discussed elsewhere. So the correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, as `Abdur-Razzaq said, narrating from Ma`mar, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, who recited this Ayah:\nوَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\") and said, \"This is the beloved of Allah, this is the close friend of Allah, this is the chosen one of Allah, this is the most beloved of the all the people of earth to Allah. He responded to the call of Allah and called mankind to that to which he had responded. He did righteous deeds in response and said, `I am one of the Muslims.' This is Allah's Khalifah.\"\nWisdom in Da`wah etc\nوَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ\n(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal.) means, there is a huge difference between them.\nادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ\n(Repel (the evil) with one which is better,) means, `when someone does you wrong, repel him by treating him well,' as `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"There is no better punishment for one who has disobeyed Allah with regard to you, than your obeying Allah with regard to him.\"\nفَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ\n(then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.) means, `if you treat well those who treat you badly, this good deed will lead to reconciliation, love and empathy, and it will be as if he is a close friend to you and he will feel pity for you and be kind to you.' Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ\n(But none is granted it except those who are patient) meaning, no one accepts this advice and works according to it, except for those who can be patient in doing so, for it is difficult for people to do.\nوَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ\n(and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, the one who has a great portion of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas explained this Ayah: \"Allah commands the believers to be patient when they feel angry, to be forbearing when confronted with ignorance, and to forgive when they are mistreated. If they do this, Allah will save them from the Shaytan and subdue their enemies to them until they become like close friends.\"\nوَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ\n(And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah.) means, the devils among men may be deceived by your kind treatment of him, but the devils among the Jinn, when they insinuate their evil whispers, cannot be dealt with except by seeking refuge with the Creator Who gave him power over you. If you seek refuge with Allah and turn to Him, He will stop him from harming you and bring his efforts to naught. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up to pray, he would say:\n«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ، مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِه»\n(I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan and his evil insinuations, breath and impurity.)\" We have already stated that there is nothing like this in the Qur'an, apart from the passage in Surat Al-A`raf, where Allah says:\nخُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِض عَنِ الْجَـهِلِينَ - وَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ\n(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish. And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower.) (7:199-200) and the passage in Surat Al-Mu'minun where Allah says:\nادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيـطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ\n(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: \"My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin. And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.\") (23:96-98)\nوَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ - فَإِنِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَالَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْـَمُونَ"

So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says:\nكَلاَّ إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَيَطْغَى - أَن رَّءَاهُ اسْتَغْنَى\n(Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.)

So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. Allah says:\nفَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ\n(Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.)

This is like the Ayah:\nفَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ\n(But Fir`awn turned away along with his hosts) (51:39).\nوَإِذَا مَسَّهُ الشَّرُّ\n(but when evil touches him,) means, difficulties,\nفَذُو دُعَآءٍ عَرِيضٍ\n(then he has recourse to long supplications.) means, he asks at length for one thing. Long supplications are those which are long on words and short on meaning. The opposite is concise speech which is brief but full of meaning. And Allah says:\nوَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ الضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنبِهِ أَوْ قَاعِدًا أَوْ قَآئِمًا فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُ مَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ\n(And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing.

Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said, \"And signs within themselves means, the battle of Badr, the conquest of Makkah, and other events which befell them, where Allah granted victory to Muhammad  ﷺ and his Companions, and inflicted a humiliating defeat on falsehood and its followers.\" It may also be that what is meant here is man and his physical composition. As detailed in the science of anatomy, which indicates the wisdom of the Creator -- may He be blessed and exalted -- and the different inclinations and opposite natures that people have, good and bad, etc., and the (divine) decrees to which man is subjected, having no power to change and over which he has no control.\nحَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ\n(until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Qur'an) is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things) means, sufficient is Allah as a Witness over the words and deeds of His servants, and He bears witness that Muhammad ﷺ  is telling the truth in what he says, as Allah says:\nلَّـكِنِ اللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ أَنزَلَهُ بِعِلْمِهِ\n(But Allah bears witness to that which He has sent down unto you; He has sent it down with His knowledge) (4:166).\nأَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ\n(Lo, Verily, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord.) means, they doubt that the Hour will come, they do not think about it or strive for it or pay heed to it; on the contrary, they regard it as irrelevant and do not care about it. But it will undoubtedly come to pass. Then Allah states that He is Able to do all things and He encompasses all things, and it is very easy for Him to bring about the Hour:\nأَلاَ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّحِيطُ\n(Verily, He is surrounding all things!) means, all of creation is subject to His control, dominion and knowledge; He is controlling all things by His power, so whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen, and there is no god worthy of worship apart from Him. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Fussilat. To Allah be praise and blessings."

This was also the view of `Ikrimah. This is like the Ayat:\nقَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا\n(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself.

(87:14-15) And;\nفَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَى أَن تَزَكَّى\n(And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself\") (79:18) What is meant by Zakah here is purification of the soul, ridding oneself of all bad qualities, the worst of which is Shirk. The Zakah paid on one's wealth is so called because it purifies wealth, and it is a means of increasing it, blessing it and making it more beneficial, and a means of assisting one to use it in doing good deeds. Qatadah said, \"They withheld the Zakah of their wealth.\" This is the apparent meaning according to many of the scholars of Tafsir, and this is the view favored by Ibn Jarir. But the matter is subject to further examination, because the obligation of Zakah was instituted during the second year after the Hijrah to Al-Madinah, according to what is stated by several scholars. Yet this Ayah was revealed in Makkah. However, it is not unlikely that the principle of giving charity and Zakah was already in place and had been enjoined at the beginning of the Prophet's mission, as Allah says:\nوَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ\n(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest) (6:141). As for the details of Zakah and how it is to be calculated according to the Nusub, were explained in Al-Madinah. This is how we may reconcile between the two opinions. Similarly, prayer was originally enjoined before sunrise and before sunset at the beginning of the Prophet's mission; it was only on the Night of the Isra', a year and a half before the Hijrah, that Allah enjoined upon His Messenger the five daily prayers. The conditions and essential elements of prayer were explained later, in stages. And Allah knows best.

Mujahid and others said, \"It will never be cut off or decrease.\" This is like the Ayat:\nمَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًا\n(They shall abide therein for ever.)

      "text": "Some Details of the Creation of this Universe Here\nAllah denounces the idolators who worship other gods apart from Him although He is the Creator, Subduer and Controller of all things. He says:\nقُلْ أَءِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِى خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ وَتَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ أَندَاداً\n(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days And you set up rivals with Him\") meaning, `false gods whom you worship alongside Him'\nذَلِكَ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That is the Lord of the that exists.) the Creator of all things is the Lord of all the creatures. Here the Ayah;\nخَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ\n(Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days) (7:54). is explained in more detail; the creation of the earth and the creation of the heaven are discussed separately. Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:\nهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَاتٍ\n(He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth. Then He rose over (Istawa ila) the heaven and made them seven heavens) (2:29). With regard to the Ayat:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا - وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا - مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed He raised its height, and has perfected it. Its night He covers with darkness and its forenoon He brings out (with light). And after that He spread the earth, And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly, (to be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) (79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something. And Allah says:\nأَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا\n(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed) until;\nوَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا\n(And after that He spread the earth.) (79:27-30) So He mentioned the creation of the heavens before the earth, then He said:\nقُلْ أَءِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِى خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days...\") until;\nطَآئِعِينَ\n(We come willingly.) Here He mentioned the creation of the earth before the creation of the heavens. And He says:\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23).\nعَزِيزاً حَكِيماً\n(Most Powerful, All-Wise) (4:56).\nسَمِيعاً بَصِيراً\n(All-Hearer, All-Seer) (4:58). It is as if He was and is no longer.' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, replied:\nفَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101), this will happen when the Trumpet is blown for the first time.\nفَصَعِقَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ اللَّهُ\n(And all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills) (39:68), and at that time there will be no kinship among them, nor will they ask of one another. Then when the Sur will be blown again,\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27). With regard to the Ayat,\nوَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ\n(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) and\nوَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً\n(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42), Allah will forgive the sincere believers their sins, then the idolators will say, `Let us say that we never joined others in worship with Allah.' Then a seal will be placed over their mouths, and their hands will speak. Then it will be known that not a single fact can be hidden from Allah, and at that point,\nيَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ\n(those who disbelieved will wish) (4:42). Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:\nدَحَـهَا\n((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.\nوَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23). This is how He described Himself, and this is how He still is. Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, so do not be confused about the Qur'an, for all of it comes from Allah.\"' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari.\nخَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n((He) created the earth in two Days) means, on Sunday and Monday.\nوَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِىَ مِن فَوْقِهَا وَبَـرَكَ فِيهَا\n(He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it,) means, He blessed it and gave it the potential to be planted with seeds and bring forth produce.\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(And measured therein its sustenance) means, what its people need of provision and places in which to plant things and grow crops. This was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which together with the two previous days add up to four days.\nفِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(in four Days equal for all those who ask.) meaning, for those who want to ask about that, so that they might know. `Ikrimah and Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا\n(and measured therein its sustenance): \"He placed in every land that which is not suited for any other land.\" Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, concerning the Ayah,\nسَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(equal for all those who ask): this means, \"For whoever wants to ask about that.\" Ibn Zayd said:\nوَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَتَهَا فِى أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ\n(and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask. ) \"According to whatever a person who is need of provision wants, Allah measures out for him what he needs.\" This is like what they said concerning the Ayah:\nوَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ\n(And He gave you of all that you asked for) (14:34). And Allah knows best.\nثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ وَهِىَ دُخَانٌ\n(Then He rose over (Istawa ila) towards the heaven when it was smoke,) i.e., steam which arose from it when the earth was created.\nفَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلاٌّرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً\n(and said to it and to the earth: \"Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.\") meaning, `respond to My command and be subjected to this action, willingly or unwillingly.'\nقَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ\n(They both said: \"We come willingly.\") meaning, `we will respond to You willingly and everything that You want to create in us -- angels, Jinn and men -- will all be obedient to You.'\nفَقَضَاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ\n(Then He completed and finished their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days) means, He finished forming them as seven heavens in two more days, which were Thursday and Friday.\nوَأَوْحَى فِى كُلِّ سَمَآءٍ أَمْرَهَا\n(and He decreed in each heaven its affair. ) means, He placed in each heaven whatever it needs of angels and things which are known only unto Him.\nوَزَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ\n(And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps) means, the stars and planets which shine on the people of the earth.\nوَحِفْظاً\n(as well as to guard.) means, as protection against the Shayatin, lest they listen to the angels on high.\nذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ\n(Such is the Decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower) means, the Almighty Who has subjugated all things to His control, the All-Knower Who knows all the movements of His creatures."
