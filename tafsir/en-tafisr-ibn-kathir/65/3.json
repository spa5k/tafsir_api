  "text": "Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women\nAllah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,\nبِمَعْرُوفٍ\n(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.\nThe Command to have Witnesses for the Return\nAllah said,\nوَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ\n(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, \"His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.\" Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata' commented on the Ayah,\nوَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ\n(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) \"It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.\" Allah's statement,\nذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ\n(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.' This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah's punishment in the Hereafter.\nAllah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa\nAllah said,\nوَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an is,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ\n(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur'an that contains relief is,\nوَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)\" `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, \"Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.\" Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,\nوَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) \"It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,\nمِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ\n(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate\" Qatadah said,\nوَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) \"meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,\nوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ\n(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated.\" Allah said,\nوَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ\n(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet's camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,\n«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»\n(O boy! I will teach you words so learn them. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ\n(Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.) meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses,\nقَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) This is like His saying:\nوَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ\n(Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.) (13:8)",
