Have Taqwa of your Lord.) Until His saying,\nوَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(but Allah's torment is severe.) were revealed, the Prophet was on a journey, and he said:\n«أَتَدْرُونَ أَيُّ يَوْمٍ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: اللهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ. قَالَ: ذَلِكَ يَوْمٌ يَقُولُ اللهُ لِآدَمَ: ابْعَثْ بَعْثَ النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قالَ: تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَوَاحِدٌ إِلَى الْجَنَّة»\n(Do you know what Day that is) They said, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" (He said: That is the Day on which Allah will say to Adam, \"Send forth (those of your progeny) who are to be sent to the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, how many are to be sent to the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise.\") The Muslims started to weep, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«قَارِبُوا وَسَدِّدُوا، فَإِنَّهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ نُبُوَّةٌ قَطُّ إِلَّا كَانَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا جَاهِلِيَّةٌ، قَالَ: فَيُؤْخَذُ الْعَدَدُ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ، فَإِنْ تَمَّتْ، وَإِلَّا كُمِّلَتْ مِنَ الْمُنَافِقِينَ، وَمَا مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ الْأُمَمِ إِلَّا كَمَثَلِ الرَّقْمَةِ فِي ذِرَاعِ الدَّابَّةِ، أَوْ كَالشَّامَةِ فِي جَنْبِ الْبَعِير»\n(Be close in your rank and be straight forward, for there was never any Prophet but there was a time of ignorance just before his advent, so the number will be taken from that time of ignorance, and if that is not enough, it will be made up from the hypocrites. A parable of yours in comparison to the other nations is that, you are like a mark on the foreleg of an animal, or a mole on the flank of a camel.) Then he said,\n«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he the narrator said, \"I do not know if he said two-thirds or not.\" This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad. Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:\n«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ\nوَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change. The Prophet said:\n«مِنْ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، وَمِنْكُمْ وَاحِدٌ، أَنْتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَالشَّعْرَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَبْيَضِ، أَوْ كَالشَّعْرَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَسْوَدِ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: شَطْرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَكَبَّرْنا»\n(Nine hundred and ninety-nine from Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and one from you. Among mankind you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or a white hair on the side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise.) We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.\nإِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ\n(Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event. This earthquake is what will happen to people when they are filled with terror, as Allah says:\nهُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِىَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً\n(There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.) 33:11. Then Allah says:\nيَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ\n(The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling,) means, she will be distracted by the horror of what she is seeing, which will make her forget the one who is the dearest of all to her and to whom she shows the most compassion. Her shock will make her neglect her infant at the very moment of breastfeeding, Allah says,\nكُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ\n(every nursing mother), and He did not say a mother who has an infant of breastfeeding age.\nعَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ\n(her nursling) means, her nursing infant that has not yet been weaned.\nوَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا\n(and every pregnant one will drop her load,) means, before the pre- gnancy has reached full term, because of the intensity of the horror.\nوَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى\n(and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state,) means, because of the severity of their situa- tion, when they will lose their minds, so that whoever sees them, will think, that they are drunk,\nوَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)"

      "text": "Clarifying the State of the Leaders of the Innovators and Those Who lead People astray\nAllah has already told us about the ignorant imitators who are led astray:\nوَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍ\n(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious Shaytan.) And here He tells us about those who call others to misguidance, the leaders of disbelief and innovation:\nومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ\n(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah).) meaning, with no correct rational thought, and no clear transmitted text; what they say is based only on their opinions and whims. Allah's saying,\nثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ\n(Bending his neck in pride,) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"Too proud to follow the truth when he is called to it.\" Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:\nثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ\n(Bending his neck in pride,) means, twisting his neck, i.e., turning away from the truth to which he is called, bending his neck out of pride and arrogance. This is like the Ayat:\nوَفِى مُوسَى إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ\n(And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority. But (Fir`awn) turned away along with his hosts) 51:38-39,\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَى مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ وَإِلَى الرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً\n(And when it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,\" you see the hypocrites turn away from you with aversion.) 4:61,\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ لَوَّوْاْ رُءُوسَهُمْ وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ\n(And when it is said to them: \"Come, so that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ may ask forgiveness from Allah for you,\" they twist their heads, and you would see them turning away their faces in pride.) 63:5, And Luqman said to his son:\nوَلاَ تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ\n(And turn not your face away from men with pride) 31:18 meaning, do not turn away from them in an arrogant manner. And Allah says:\nوَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا وَلَّى مُسْتَكْبِراً\n(And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in pride) 31:7.\nلِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah.) This either refers to those who are stubborn, or it means that the person who does this has been created like this so that he will be one of those who lead others astray from the path of Allah. Then Allah says:\nلَهُ فِى الدُّنْيَا خِزْىٌ\n(For him there is disgrace in this worldly life,) meaning, humiliation and shame, such as when he is too arrogant to heed the signs of Allah, so Allah will send humiliation upon him in this world and will punish him in this world, before he reaches the Hereafter, because this world is all he cares about and all he knows.\nوَنُذِيقُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاكَ\n(and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the torment of burning. That is because of what your hands have sent forth,) means, this will be said to him by way of rebuke.\nوَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ\n(and verily, Allah is not unjust to the servants.) This is like the Ayah:\nخُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n((It will be said: ) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\") 44:47-50"

      "text": "The meaning of worshipping Allah as it were upon the edge\nMujahid, Qatadah and others said:\nعَلَى حَرْفٍ\n(upon the edge) means, in doubt. Others said that it meant on the edge, such as on the edge or side of a mountain, i.e., (this person) enters Islam on the edge, and if he finds what he likes he will continue, otherwise he will leave. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said:\nوَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ\n(And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge.) \"People would come to Al-Madinah to declare their Islam and if their wives gave birth to sons and their mares gave birth to foals, they would say, `This is a good religion,' but if their wives and their mares did not give birth, they would say, `This is a bad religion.\"' Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"One of them would come to Al-Madinah, which was a land that was infected with a contagious disease. If he remained healthy there, and his mare foaled and his wife gave birth to a boy, he would be content, and would say, `I have not experienced anything but good since I started to follow this religion.\"\nوَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ\n(but if a Fitnah strikes him), Fitnah here means affliction, i.e., if the disease of Al-Madinah befalls him, and his wife gives birth to a babe girl and charity is delayed in coming to him, the Shaytan comes to him and says: `By Allah, since you started to follow this religion of yours, you have experienced nothing but bad things,' and this is the Fitnah.\" This was also mentioned by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Jurayj and others among the Salaf when explaining this Ayah.

      "text": "Allah will judge between the Sects on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah tells us about the followers of these various religions, the believers (Muslims) and others such as the Jews and Sabians. We have already seen a definition of them in Surat Al-Baqarah and have noted how people differ over who they are. There are also the Christians, Majus and others who worship others alongside Allah. Allah will\nيَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ\n(judge between them on the Day of Resurrection) with justice; He will admit those who believed in Him to Paradise and will send those who disbelieved in Him to Hell, for He is a Witness over their deeds, and He knows all that they say and all that they do in secret, and conceal in their breast."

      "text": "Everything prostrates to Allah\nAllah tells us that He alone, with no partner or associate, is deserving of worship. Everything prostrates to His might, willingly or unwillingly, and everything prostrates in a manner that befits its nature, as Allah says:\nأَوَ لَمْيَرَوْاْ إِلَىخَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّأُ ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَالْشَّمَآئِلِ سُجَّدًا لِلَّهِ وَهُمْ\n(Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly) 16:48. And Allah says here:\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(See you not that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth prostrate themselves to Him) means, the angels in the regions of the heavens, and all the living creatures, men, Jinn, animals and birds.\nوَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ\n(and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise) 17:44.\nوَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ\n(and the sun, and the moon, and the stars,) These are mentioned by name, because they are worshipped instead of Allah, so Allah explains that they too prostrate to their Creator and that they are subjected to Him.\nلاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ\n(Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them) 41:37. In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«أَتَدْرِي أَيْنَ تَذْهَبُ هَذِهِ الشَّمْسُ؟»\n(Do you know where this sun goes) I said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,\n«فَإِنَّهَا تَذْهَبُ فَتَسْجُدُ تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ، ثُمَّ تَسْتَأْمِرُ فَيُوشِكُ أَنْ يُقَالَ لَهَا: ارْجِعِي مِنْ حَيْثُ جِئْت»\n(It goes (sets) and prostrates beneath the Throne, then it awaits the command. Soon it will be told, \"Go back the way whence you came.\")\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"A man came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I saw myself in a dream last night, as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated, and the tree prostrated when I did, and I heard it saying, \"O Allah, write down a reward for me for that, and remove a sin from me for that, store it with You for me and accept it from me as You accepted from Your servant Dawud.\"' Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited an Ayah mentioning a prostration, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had told him the tree said.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban in his Sahih.\nوَالدَّوَآبِّ\n(Ad-Dawabb) means all the animals. It was reported in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade using the backs of animals as platforms for speaking, for, perhaps the one who was being ridden was better and remembered Allah more than the one who was riding.\nوَكَثِيرٌ مِّنَ النَّاسِ\n(and many of mankind) means, they prostrate willingly, submitting themselves to Allah of their own free will.\nوَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ الْعَذَابُ\n(But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.) means, those who refuse prostration, are stubborn and arrogant.\nوَمَن يُهِنِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّكْرِمٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ\n(And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honor him. Verily, Allah does what He wills.) It was recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِذَا قَرَأَ ابْنُ آدَمَ السَّجْدَةَ اعْتَزَلَ الشَّيْطَانُ يَبْكِي، يَقُولُ: يَا وَيْلَهُ أُمِرَ ابْنُ آدَمَ بِالسُّجُودِ فَسَجَدَ فَلَهُ الْجَنَّةُ، وَأُمِرْتُ بِالسُّجُودِ فَأَبَيْتُ فَلِيَ النَّار»\n(When the son of Adam recites the Ayat containing the prostration, the Shaytan withdraws weeping and says, \"Ah! Woe (to me)! the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate and he prostrated, so Paradise is his; I was commanded to prostrate and I refused, so I am doomed to Hell.\") This was recorded by Muslim. In his book Al-Marasil, Abu Dawud recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan, may Allah have mercy upon him, reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْقُرْآنِ بِسَجْدَتَيْن»\n(Surat Al-Hajj has been favored over the rest of the Qur'an with two prostrations.\") Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Isma`ili recorded from Abu Al-Jahm that `Umar did the two prostrations of Surat Al-Hajj when he was in Al-Jabiyah, and he said, \"This Surah has been favored with two prostrations.\""

Have Taqwa of your Lord.) Until His saying,\nوَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(but Allah's torment is severe.) were revealed, the Prophet was on a journey, and he said:\n«أَتَدْرُونَ أَيُّ يَوْمٍ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: اللهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ. قَالَ: ذَلِكَ يَوْمٌ يَقُولُ اللهُ لِآدَمَ: ابْعَثْ بَعْثَ النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قالَ: تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَوَاحِدٌ إِلَى الْجَنَّة»\n(Do you know what Day that is) They said, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" (He said: That is the Day on which Allah will say to Adam, \"Send forth (those of your progeny) who are to be sent to the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, how many are to be sent to the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise.\") The Muslims started to weep, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«قَارِبُوا وَسَدِّدُوا، فَإِنَّهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ نُبُوَّةٌ قَطُّ إِلَّا كَانَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا جَاهِلِيَّةٌ، قَالَ: فَيُؤْخَذُ الْعَدَدُ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ، فَإِنْ تَمَّتْ، وَإِلَّا كُمِّلَتْ مِنَ الْمُنَافِقِينَ، وَمَا مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ الْأُمَمِ إِلَّا كَمَثَلِ الرَّقْمَةِ فِي ذِرَاعِ الدَّابَّةِ، أَوْ كَالشَّامَةِ فِي جَنْبِ الْبَعِير»\n(Be close in your rank and be straight forward, for there was never any Prophet but there was a time of ignorance just before his advent, so the number will be taken from that time of ignorance, and if that is not enough, it will be made up from the hypocrites. A parable of yours in comparison to the other nations is that, you are like a mark on the foreleg of an animal, or a mole on the flank of a camel.) Then he said,\n«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he the narrator said, \"I do not know if he said two-thirds or not.\" This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad. Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:\n«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ\nوَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change. The Prophet said:\n«مِنْ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، وَمِنْكُمْ وَاحِدٌ، أَنْتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَالشَّعْرَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَبْيَضِ، أَوْ كَالشَّعْرَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَسْوَدِ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: شَطْرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَكَبَّرْنا»\n(Nine hundred and ninety-nine from Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and one from you. Among mankind you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or a white hair on the side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise.) We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.\nإِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ\n(Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event. This earthquake is what will happen to people when they are filled with terror, as Allah says:\nهُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِىَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً\n(There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.) 33:11. Then Allah says:\nيَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ\n(The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling,) means, she will be distracted by the horror of what she is seeing, which will make her forget the one who is the dearest of all to her and to whom she shows the most compassion. Her shock will make her neglect her infant at the very moment of breastfeeding, Allah says,\nكُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ\n(every nursing mother), and He did not say a mother who has an infant of breastfeeding age.\nعَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ\n(her nursling) means, her nursing infant that has not yet been weaned.\nوَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا\n(and every pregnant one will drop her load,) means, before the pre- gnancy has reached full term, because of the intensity of the horror.\nوَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى\n(and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state,) means, because of the severity of their situa- tion, when they will lose their minds, so that whoever sees them, will think, that they are drunk,\nوَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)"

      "text": "The Reason for Revelation\nIt was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Dharr swore that this Ayah --\nهَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ\n(These two opponents dispute with each other about their Lord;) was revealed concerning Hamzah and his two companions, and `Utbah and his two companions, on the day of Badr when they came forward to engage in single combat. This is the wording of Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah. Then Al-Bukhari recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"I will be the first one to kneel down before the Most Merciful so that the dispute may be settled on the Day of Resurrection.\" Qays (sub-narrator) said, \"Concerning them the Ayah was revealed:\nهَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ\n(These two opponents dispute with each other about their Lord;) He (Qays) said, \"They are the ones who came forward (for single combat) on the day of Badr: `Ali, Hamzah and `Ubaydah vs., Shaybah bin Rabi`ah, `Utbah bin Rabi`ah and Al-Walid bin `Utbah.\" This was reported only by Al-Bukhari. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on this Ayah, \"Such as the disbeliever and the believer disputing about the Resurrection.\" According to one report Mujahid and `Ata' commented on this Ayah, \"This refers to the believers and the disbelievers.\" The view of Mujahid and `Ata' that this refers to the disbelievers and the believers, includes all opinions, the story of Badr as well as the others. For the believers want to support the religion of Allah, while the disbelievers want to extinguish the light of faith and to defeat the truth and cause falsehood to prevail. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is good.\nThe Punishment of the Disbelievers\nفَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارِ\n(then as for those who disbelieved, garments of fire will be cut out for them,) meaning, pieces of fire will be prepared for them. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Of copper, for it is the hottest of things when it is heated.\" n\nهَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارِ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ - يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِى بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ\n(boiling water will be poured down over their heads. With it will melt (or vanish away) what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins.) meaning, when the boiling water --which is water that has been heated to the ultimate degree- is poured down over their heads. Ibn Jarir recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ الْحَمِيمَ لَيُصَبُّ عَلَى رُؤُوسِهِمْ فَيَنْفُذُ الْجُمْجُمَةَ حَتَّى يَخْلُصَ إِلَى جَوْفِهِ، فَيَسْلُتَ مَا فِي جَوْفِهِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ قَدَمَيْهِ، وَهُوَ الصِّهْرُ، ثُمَّ يُعَادُ كَمَا كَان»\n(The boiling water will be poured over their heads and will penetrate their skulls until it reaches what is inside, and what is inside will melt until it reaches their feet. This is the melting, then he will be restored to the state he was before.) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said it is Hasan Sahih. This was also recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim, who then recorded that `Abdullah bin As-Sariy said, \"The angel will come to him, carrying the vessel with a pair of tongs because of its heat. When he brings it near to his face, he will shy away from it. He will raise a hammer that he is carrying and will strike his head with it, and his brains will spill out, then he will pour the brains back into his head. This is what Allah says in the Ayah:\nيُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِى بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ\n(With it will melt what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins.)\"\nوَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ\n(And for them are hooked rods of iron.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They will be struck with them, and with each blow, a limb will be severed, and they will cry out for oblivion.\"\nكُلَّمَآ أَرَادُواْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا\n(Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be driven back therein,) Al-A`mash reported from Abu Zibiyan that Salman said, \"The fire of Hell is black and dark; its flames and coals do not glow or shine.\" Then he recited:\nكُلَّمَآ أَرَادُواْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا\n(Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be driven back therein,)\nوَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ\n(\"Taste the torment of burning!\") This is like the Ayah:\nوَقِيلَ لَهُمْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ النَّارِ الَّذِي كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ\n(and it will be said to them: \"Taste you the torment of the Fire which you used to deny.\") 32:20. The meaning is that they will be humiliated by words and actions."

He tells us:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ جَنَـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ\n(Truly, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds, to Gardens underneath which rivers flow,) means, these rivers flow throughout its regions, beneath its trees and palaces, and its inhabitants direct them to go wherever they want.\nيُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا\n(wherein they will be adorned) -- with jewelry --\nمِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤاً\n(with bracelets of gold and pearls) means, on their arms, as the Prophet said in the agreed-upon Hadith:\n«تَبْلُغُ الْحِلْيَةُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ حَيْثُ يَبْلُغُ الْوَضُوء»\n(The jewelry of the believer in Paradise will reach as far as his Wudu' reached.)\nوَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ\n(and their garments therein will be of silk. ) in contrast to the garments of fire worn by the inhabitants of Hell, the people of Paradise will have garments of silk, Sundus and Istabraq fine green silk and gold embroidery, as Allah says:\nعَـلِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ وَحُلُّواْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ وَسَقَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَاباً طَهُوراً - إِنَّ هَـذَا كَانَ لَكُمْ جَزَآءً وَكَانَ سَعْيُكُم مَّشْكُوراً\n(Their garments will be of green Sundus, and Istabraq. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a pure drink. (And it will be said to them): \"Verily, this is a reward for you, and your endeavor has been accepted.\") 76:21-22. In the Sahih, it says:\n«لَا تَلْبَسُوا الْحَرِيرَ وَلَا الدِّيبَاجَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ لَبِسَهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا لَمْ يَلْبَسْهُ فِي الْآخِرَة»\n(Do not wear fine silk or gold embroidery in this world, for whoever wears them in this world, will not wear them in the Hereafter.) `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said, \"Those who do not wear silk in the Hereafter are those who will not enter Paradise. Allah says:\nوَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ\n(and their garments therein will be of silk)\"\nوَهُدُواْ إِلَى الطَّيِّبِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ\n(And they are guided unto goodly speech.)

Some scholars of Tafsir said that the Ayah,\nوَهُدُواْ إِلَى الطَّيِّبِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ\n(And they are guided unto goodly speech) refers to the Qur'an; and it was said that it means La ilaha illallah or words of remembrance prescribed in Islam.

      "text": "A Warning to Those Who hinder Others from the Path of Allah and from Al-Masj id Al-Haram and Who seek to do Evil Actions therein\nAllah rebukes the disbelievers for preventing the believers from coming to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and performing their rites and rituals there, claiming that they were its guardians,\nوَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ\n(and they are not its guardians. None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa) 8:34. In this Ayah there is proof that it was revealed in Al-Madinah, as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah:\nيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and to drive out its inhabitants) 2:217 And Allah says here:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ\n(Verily, those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram) meaning, not only are they disbelievers, but they also hinder people from the path of Allah and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram. They prevent the believers who want to go there from reaching it, although the believers have more right than anyone else to go there. The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ\n(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah.\nThe Issue of renting Houses in Makkah\nالَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,\n«وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»\n(Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,\n«لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»\n(A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best.\nA Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)\nبِظُلْمٍ\n(or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you. If a person does this, then he deserves to suffer a painful torment.\"\nبِظُلْمٍ\n(or to do wrong,) Mujahid said, \"To do some bad action therein. This is one of the unique features of Al-Haram, that the person who is about to do some evil action should be punished if this is his intention, even if he has not yet commenced the action.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded in his Tafsir that `Abdullah (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud) commented about the Ayah,\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"If a man intends to do some evil action therein, Allah will make him taste a painful torment.\" This was also recorded by Ahmad. I say, its chain is Sahih according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari, and it is more likely Mawquf than Marfu`. And Allah knows best. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent him with two men, one of whom was a Muhajir and the other from among the Ansar. They began to boast about their lineages and `Abdullah bin Unays got angry and killed the Ansari. Then he reverted from Islam (became an apostate) and fled to Makkah. Then these words were revealed concerning him:\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) meaning, whoever flees to Al-Haram to do evil actions, i.e., by leaving Islam.\" These reports indicate some meanings of the phrase \"evil actions\", but the meaning is more general than that and includes things which are more serious. Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,\nتَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ\n(Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»\n(This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.)"

Allah tells us that He showed Ibrahim the site of the `Atiq House, i.e., He guided him to it, entrusted it to him and granted him permission to build it. Many scholars take this as evidence to support their view that Ibrahim was the first one to build the House and that it was not built before his time. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Dharr said, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, which Masjid was the first to be built' He said,\n«الْمَسْجِدُ الْحَرَام»\n(Al-Masjid Al-Haram.) I said, `Then which' He said,\n«بَيْتُ الْمَقْدِس»\n(Bayt Al-Maqdis.)

Allah says:\nوَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ\n(and those who bow, and make prostration.) Tawaf and prayer are mentioned together because they are not prescribed together anywhere except in relation to the House. Tawaf is done around the Ka`bah and prayer is offered facing its direction in the majority of cases, with a few exceptions, such as when one is uncertain of the direction of the Qiblah, during battle and when praying optional prayers while traveling. And Allah knows best.\nوَأَذِّن فِى النَّاسِ بِالْحَجِّ\n(And proclaim to mankind the Hajj) meaning, `announce the pilgrimage to mankind and call them to perform pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build.'

Your Lord has established a House so come on pilgrimage to it.\" It is said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice would reach all the regions of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers' wombs and their fathers' loins would hear the call. The response came from everyone in the cities, deserts and countryside, and those whom Allah has decreed will make the pilgrimage, until the Day of Resurrection: \"At Your service, O Allah, at Your service.\" This is a summary of the narrations from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among the Salaf. And Allah knows best. This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and by Ibn Abi Hatim at length.\nيَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً وَعَلَى كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ\n(They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel,) This Ayah was used as evidence by those scholars whose view is that Hajj performed on foot by those who are able, is better than Hajj performed riding, because the phrase \"on foot\" is mentioned first, and because it is an indication of their keenness and resolve. Waki` narrated from Abu Al-`Umays from Abu Halhalah from Muhammad bin Ka`b that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I do not regret anything except for the fact that I wish I had performed Hajj on foot, because Allah says,\nيَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً\n(They will come to you on foot).\" But the majority are of the view that performing Hajj while riding is better, following the example of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, because he performed Hajj riding, although his physical ability was sound.\nيَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ\n(they will come from every Fajj) means every route, as Allah says:\nوَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً\n(and We placed therein Fijaj for them to pass) 21:31.\nعَميِقٍ\n(`Amiq) means dis- tant.

      "text": "The Reward for avoiding Sin\nAllah says: `This is what We have commanded you to do in the rituals (of Hajj), and this is the great reward that the person who does that will gain.'\nوَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَـتِ اللَّهِ\n(whoever honors the sacred things of Allah,) means, whoever avoids disobeying Him and does not transgress that which is sacred, and regards committing sin as a very serious matter,\nفَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ\n(then that is better for him with his Lord.) means, he will attain much good and a great reward for doing that. Just as the one who does acts of obedience will earn a great reward, so too, the one who avoids sin will earn a great reward.\nCattle are Lawful\nوَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الاٌّنْعَـمُ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ\n(The cattle are lawful to you, except those (that will be) mentioned to you.) means, `We have made permissible for you all the An`am (cattle etc.),' and Allah has not instituted things like Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Ham.\nإِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ\n(except those mentioned to you.) the prohibition of Al-Maytah, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns -- and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal -- unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub. This was the view of Ibn Jarir, who recorded it from Qatadah.\nThe Command to shun Shirk and Lying\nفَاجْتَنِبُواْ الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاٌّوْثَـنِ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِ\n(So shun the Rijis of the idols, and shun false speech.) From this it is clear what Ar-Rijs means, i.e., avoid the abomination, which means idols. Shirk is mentioned in conjunction with false speech, as in the Ayah:\nقُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ\n(Say: \"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge\".) 7:33 This includes bearing false witness. In the Two Sahihs it was reported from Abu Bakrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا أُنَبِّــئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you about the worst of major sins) We said, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said:\n«الْإِشْرَاكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ (Associating others with Allah, disobeying one's parents.) He was reclining, then he sat up and said: أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ،أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور»\n(and indeed giving false statements, and indeed bearing false witness...) and he kept on repeating it until we wished that he would stop.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Khuraym bin Fatik Al-Asadi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ prayed As-Subh (Al-Fajr), and when he had finished, he stood up and said:\n«عَدَلَتْ شَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ الْإِشْرَاكَ بِاللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»\n(Bearing false witness is on a par with the association of others with Allah.) Then he recited this Ayah:\nفَاجْتَنِبُواْ الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاٌّوْثَـنِ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِحُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ\n(So shun the Rijs of the idols, and shun lying speech. Hunafa' Lillah, not associating partners unto Him;)\nحُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ\n(Hunafa' Lillah) means, sincerely submitting to Him Alone, shunning falsehood and seeking the truth. Allah says:\nغَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ\n(not associating partners unto Him;) Then Allah gives a likeness of the idolator in his misguidance and being doomed and being far away from true guidance, and says:\nوَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky,) meaning,\nفَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ\n(the birds caught him in midair,)\nأَوْ تَهْوِى بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِى مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ\n(or the wind had thrown him to a far off place.) means, remote and desolate, dangerous for anyone who lands there. Hence it says in the Hadith of Al-Bara':\n«إِنَّ الْكَافِرَ إِذَا تَوَفَّتْهُ مَلَائِكَةُ الْمَوْتِ وَصَعِدُوا بِرُوحِهِ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ، فَلَا تُفْتَحُ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ السَّمَاءِ بَلْ تُطْرَحُ رُوحُهُ طَرْحًا مِنْ هُنَاك»\n(When the angels of death take the soul of the disbeliever in death, they take his soul up to the heaven, but the gates of heaven are not opened for him; on the contrary, his soul is thrown down from there.) Then he recited this Ayah. The Hadith has already been quoted in our explanation of Surah Ibrahim. Allah gives another parable of the idolators in Surat Al-An`am, where He says:\nقُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَـبٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى الْهُدَى ائْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَى\n(Say: \"Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor can harm us, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us -- like one whom the Shayaلtin have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): `Come to us.\"' Say: \"Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance.\") 6:71"

Just as the one who does acts of obedience will earn a great reward, so too, the one who avoids sin will earn a great reward.\nCattle are Lawful\nوَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الاٌّنْعَـمُ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ\n(The cattle are lawful to you, except those (that will be) mentioned to you.) means, `We have made permissible for you all the An`am (cattle etc.),' and Allah has not instituted things like Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Ham.\nإِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ\n(except those mentioned to you.) the prohibition of Al-Maytah, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns -- and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal -- unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub. This was the view of Ibn Jarir, who recorded it from Qatadah.\nThe Command to shun Shirk and Lying\nفَاجْتَنِبُواْ الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاٌّوْثَـنِ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِ\n(So shun the Rijis of the idols, and shun false speech.) From this it is clear what Ar-Rijs means, i.e., avoid the abomination, which means idols. Shirk is mentioned in conjunction with false speech, as in the Ayah:\nقُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ\n(Say: \"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge\".) 7:33 This includes bearing false witness. In the Two Sahihs it was reported from Abu Bakrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا أُنَبِّــئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»\n(Shall I not tell you about the worst of major sins) We said, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said:\n«الْإِشْرَاكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ (Associating others with Allah, disobeying one's parents.) He was reclining, then he sat up and said: أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ،أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور»\n(and indeed giving false statements, and indeed bearing false witness...) and he kept on repeating it until we wished that he would stop.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Khuraym bin Fatik Al-Asadi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ prayed As-Subh (Al-Fajr), and when he had finished, he stood up and said:\n«عَدَلَتْ شَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ الْإِشْرَاكَ بِاللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»\n(Bearing false witness is on a par with the association of others with Allah.) Then he recited this Ayah:\nفَاجْتَنِبُواْ الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاٌّوْثَـنِ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِحُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ\n(So shun the Rijs of the idols, and shun lying speech. Hunafa' Lillah, not associating partners unto Him;)\nحُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ\n(Hunafa' Lillah) means, sincerely submitting to Him Alone, shunning falsehood and seeking the truth. Allah says:\nغَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ\n(not associating partners unto Him;) Then Allah gives a likeness of the idolator in his misguidance and being doomed and being far away from true guidance, and says:\nوَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky,) meaning,\nفَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ\n(the birds caught him in midair,)\nأَوْ تَهْوِى بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِى مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ\n(or the wind had thrown him to a far off place.) means, remote and desolate, dangerous for anyone who lands there. Hence it says in the Hadith of Al-Bara':\n«إِنَّ الْكَافِرَ إِذَا تَوَفَّتْهُ مَلَائِكَةُ الْمَوْتِ وَصَعِدُوا بِرُوحِهِ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ، فَلَا تُفْتَحُ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ السَّمَاءِ بَلْ تُطْرَحُ رُوحُهُ طَرْحًا مِنْ هُنَاك»\n(When the angels of death take the soul of the disbeliever in death, they take his soul up to the heaven, but the gates of heaven are not opened for him; on the contrary, his soul is thrown down from there.) Then he recited this Ayah. The Hadith has already been quoted in our explanation of Surah Ibrahim. Allah gives another parable of the idolators in Surat Al-An`am, where He says:\nقُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَـبٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى الْهُدَى ائْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَى\n(Say: \"Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor can harm us, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us -- like one whom the Shayaلtin have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): `Come to us.\"' Say: \"Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance.\") 6:71"

      "text": "Condemnation of the Followers of the Shaytan\nAllah condemns those who deny the Resurrection and who deny that Allah is able to restore life to the dead, those who turn away from that which Allah has revealed to His Prophets and, in their views -- denial and disbelief -- follow every rebellious Shaytan among men and Jinn. This is the state of the followers of innovation and misguidance, who turn away from the truth and follow falsehood, following the words of the leaders of misguidance who call people to follow innovation and their own desires and opinions. Allah says concerning them and their like,\nوَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ\n(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge,) meaning, without sound knowledge.\nوَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍكُتِبَ عَلَيْهِ\n(and follows every rebellious Shaytan. For him it is decreed.) Mujahid said, \"This refers to that Shaytan.\" meaning that is a matter written in the decree.\nأَنَّهُ مَن تَوَلاَّهُ\n(that whosoever follows him,) and imitates him,\nفَأَنَّهُ يُضِلُّهُ وَيَهْدِيهِ إِلَى عَذَابِ السَّعِيرِ\n(he will mislead him, and will drive him to the torment of the Fire.) means, he will mislead him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will drive him to the torment of the Fire, which is unbearably hot, painful and agonizing. As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said, \"This Ayah was revealed about An-Nadr bin Al-Harith. This was also the view of Ibn Jurayj."

In Sunan Ibn Majah, it was recorded from Abu Rafi` that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two castrated, fat, horned rams.

As for the Muqabilah, it is the one whose ear is cut at the front, Mudabirah is the one whose ear is cut at the back, the Shurqa is the one whose ear is split, as Ash-Shafi`i said. The Kharqa' is the one whose ear is pierced with a hole. And Allah knows best.

This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih.\nThe Benefits of the Sacrificial Camels\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ\n(In them are benefits for you) meaning, in the Budn (sacrificial camels) you find benefits such as their milk their wool and hair, and their use for riding.\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(In them are benefits for you for an appointed term,) Miqsam reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"Until you decide to offer them as a sacrifice.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw a man driving his sacrificial camel and said,\n«ارْكَبْهَا»\n(Ride it.) The man said, \"It is a sacrificial camel.\" He said,\n«ارْكَبْهَا وَيْحَك»\n(Ride it, woe to you!) the second or third time. According to a report recorded by Muslim from Jabir, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«ارْكَبْهَا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ إِذَا أُلْجِئْتَ إِلَيْهَا»\n(Ride it gently accor- ding to your needs.)\nثُمَّ مَحِلُّهَآ إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ\n(and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice to the `Atiq House.) meaning, they are eventually brought to the `Atiq House -- which is the Ka`bah -- as Allah says:\nهَدْياً بَـلِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ\n(an offering, brought to the Ka`bah) 5:95\nوَالْهَدْىَ مَعْكُوفاً أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ\n(and detained the Hady, from reaching their place of sacrifice) 48:25"

Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded from Jabir: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two castrated, fat, horned rams.\" It was said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded us to examine their eyes and ears, and not to sacrifice the Muqabilah, the Mudabirah, the Sharqa, nor the Kharqa'.\" This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. As for the Muqabilah, it is the one whose ear is cut at the front, Mudabirah is the one whose ear is cut at the back, the Shurqa is the one whose ear is split, as Ash-Shafi`i said. The Kharqa' is the one whose ear is pierced with a hole. And Allah knows best. It was recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَرْبَعٌ لَاتَجُوزُ فِي الْأَضَاحِي: الْعَوْرَاءُ الْبَيِّنُ عَوَرُهَا، وَالْمَرِيضَةُ الْبَيِّنُ مَرَضُهَا، وَالْعَرْجَاءُ الْبَيِّنُ ظَلَعُهَا، وَالْكَسِيرَةُ الَّتِي لَاتُنْقِي»\n(Four are not permitted for sacrifice: those that are obviously one-eyed, those that are obviously sick, those that are obviously lame and those that have broken bones, which no one would choose.) This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih.\nThe Benefits of the Sacrificial Camels\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ\n(In them are benefits for you) meaning, in the Budn (sacrificial camels) you find benefits such as their milk their wool and hair, and their use for riding.\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(In them are benefits for you for an appointed term,) Miqsam reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"Until you decide to offer them as a sacrifice.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw a man driving his sacrificial camel and said,\n«ارْكَبْهَا»\n(Ride it.) The man said, \"It is a sacrificial camel.\" He said,\n«ارْكَبْهَا وَيْحَك»\n(Ride it, woe to you!) the second or third time. According to a report recorded by Muslim from Jabir, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«ارْكَبْهَا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ إِذَا أُلْجِئْتَ إِلَيْهَا»\n(Ride it gently accor- ding to your needs.)\nثُمَّ مَحِلُّهَآ إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ\n(and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice to the `Atiq House.) meaning, they are eventually brought to the `Atiq House -- which is the Ka`bah -- as Allah says:\nهَدْياً بَـلِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ\n(an offering, brought to the Ka`bah) 5:95\nوَالْهَدْىَ مَعْكُوفاً أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ\n(and detained the Hady, from reaching their place of sacrifice) 48:25"

For He has decreed that they should be brought to His Sacred House; indeed, they are the best of that which may be offered as a sacrifice to Allah, as He says:\nلاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ اللَّهِ وَلاَ الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ وَلاَ الْهَدْىَ وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ\n(Violate not the sanctity of the Sha`a'ir of Allah, nor of the Sacred Month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlanded people or animals, and others, nor the people coming to the Sacred House)5:2\nوَالْبُدْنَ جَعَلْنَـهَا لَكُمْ مِّن شَعَـئِرِ اللَّهِ\n(And the Budn, We have made them for you as among the symbols of Allah,) Ibn Jurayj said: \"Ata' commented on this Ayah, `Cattle and camels.\"' A similar view was also reported from Ibn `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Mujahid said: \"Al-Budn means camels.\" According to Muslim, Jabir bin `Abdullah and others said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded us to share in offering the sacrifice, a Budn (camel) for seven people, and one cow for seven people.\"\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ\n(wherein you have much good. ) means, reward in the Hereafter.\nفَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ\n(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice).) It was reported from Al-Muttalib bin `Abdullah bin Hantab that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"I prayed with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on `Id Al-Adha. When he finished, he brought a ram and slaughtered it, saying,\n«بِاسْمِ اللهِ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنِّي وَعَمَّنْ لَمْ يُضَحِّ مِنْ أُمَّتِي»\n(Bismillah, and Allahu Akbar. O Allah, this is on behalf of me and anyone of my Ummah who has not offered a sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Yazid bin Abi Habib from Ibn `Abbas that Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two rams on the day of `Id, and when he lay them down to sacrifice them, he said:\n«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ مِنْكَ وَلَكَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأُمَّتِه»\n(I turn my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, being true and sincere in faith submitting myself to Him Alone, and I am not of the idolators. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists for, with no partner or associate for Him. Thus am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O Allah, from You and to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his Ummah.) Then he said, `Bismillah' and `Allahu Akbar' and slaughtered them.\" It was reported from `Ali bin Al-Husayn from Abu Rafi` that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wanted to offer a sacrifice, he would buy two fat, horned, fine rams. When he had prayed and addressed the people, he would bring one of them to where he was standing in the prayer place, and would sacrifice it himself with a knife, then he would say:\n«اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنْ أُمَّتِي جَمِيعِهَا: مَنْ شَهِدَ لَكَ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لِي بِالْبَلَاغ»\n(O Allah, this is on behalf of all of my Ummah, whoever bears witness of Tawhid of You and bears witness that I have conveyed.) Then he would bring the other ram and sacrifice it himself, and say,\n«هَذَا عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّد»\n(This is on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.) He would give them to the poor and he and his family would eat from it as well. This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Zabiyan from Ibn `Abbas,\nفَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ\n(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). ) \"When they are standing on three legs, with the left foreleg tied up. He says Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah, Allahumma Minka wa Laka (In the Name of Allah and Allah is Most Great; there is no God but Allah. O Allah, from You and to You).\" In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Umar came to a man who had made his camel kneel down in order to sacrifice it. He said, \"Make it stand up fettered, (this is) the Sunnah of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\"\nفَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا\n(Then, when they are down on their sides,) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"This means, when it has fallen to the ground.\" This was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and a similar view was narrated from Muqatil bin Hayyan. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,\nفَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا\n(Then, when they are down on their sides,) \"Meaning, when they have died.\" This is what was meant by the comment of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid, for it is not permitted to eat from the sacrifice when it has been slaughtered until it has died and its movements have ceased. It was reported in a Marfu` Hadith:\n«لَا تُعَجِّلُوا النُّفُوسَ أَنْ تَزْهَق»\n(Do not rush until you are sure that the animal is dead. ) Ath-Thawri narrated in his Jami` that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that, and he supported it with the Hadith of Shaddad bin `Aws in Sahih Muslim:\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَه»\n(Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. If you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.) It was recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا قُطِعَ مِنَ الْبَهِيمَةِ وَهِيَ حَيَّةٌ فَهُوَ مَيْتَة»\n(Whatever is cut from an animal while it is still alive is Maytah (dead flesh).) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.\nفَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ\n(eat thereof, and feed Qani` and the Mu`tarr...) This is a command which implies that this is permissible. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is content with what he is given and he stays in his house, and the Mu`tarr is the one who comes to you and rubs shoulders with you so that you will give him some meat, but he does not ask for it. \" This was also the view of Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is too proud to ask, and Mu`tarr is the one who does ask.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mujahid, according to one report narrated from him. And the opposite was also suggested. This Ayah has been quoted as evidence by those scholars who said that the sacrifice should be divided into three: a third for the one who offers the sacrifice to eat from, a third to be given as gifts to his friends, and a third to be given in charity to the poor, because Allah says:\nفَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ\n(eat thereof, and feed the poor who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.) But there is no evidence in this Ayah for this view. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people: c\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنِ ادِّخَارِ لُحُومِ الْأَضَاحِي فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا مَا بَدَا لَكُم»\n(I used to forbid you to keep the meat of the sacrifice for more than three days, but now eat from it and keep it as you see fit.) According to another report:\n«فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»\n(Eat some, keep some and give some in charity.) According to another report:\n«فَكُلُوا وَأَطْعِمُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»\n(Eat some, feed others, and give some in charity.) As for the animal skins, it was recorded in Musnad Ahmad from Qatadah bin An-Nu`man in the Hadith about the sacrifice:\n«فَكُلُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا، وَاسْتَمْتِعُوا بِجُلُودِهَا وَلَا تَبِيعُوهَا»\n(Eat and give in charity, and make use of the skins, but do not sell them.) (Note) It was recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا نَبْدَأُ بِهِ فِي يَوْمِنَا هَذَا أَنْ نُصَلِّيَ، ثُمَّ نَرْجِعَ فَنَنْحَرَ، فَمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ أَصَابَ سُنَّتَنَا، وَمَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ لَحْمٌ قَدَّمَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ لَيْسَ مِنَ النُّسُكِ فِي شَيْء»\n(The first thing that we should do on this day of ours (`Id) is to pray, then we return and offer the sacrifice. Whoever does that will have followed our Sunnah. Whoever slaughters his animal before the prayer, this is just meat which he has brought for his family, it is not a sacrifice at all.) This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And in Sahih Muslim, it is mentioned that one is not to offer the sacrifice until the Imam (leader) has offered his. It is prescribed to offer the sacrifice on the day of Nahr and the following three days of Tashriq, because of the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»\n(The days of Tashriq are all (for) sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Hibban.\nكَذلِكَ سَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ\n(Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.) means, for this reason.\nسَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ\n(Thus have We made them subject to you) means, `We have subjugated them to you, i.e., We have made them submissive towards you, so that if you wish you can ride them, or if you wish you can milk them, or if you wish you can slaughter them,' as Allah says:\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ\n(Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners.)36:71 until He said:\nأَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ\n(Will they not then be grateful) 36:73 And Allah says in this Ayah:\nكَذلِكَ سَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ\n(Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.)"

      "text": "The Goal of the Udhiyyah (Sacrifice) according to Allah is the Sincerity and Taqwa of His Servant\nAllah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:\nلَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا\n(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, \"The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"We have more right to do that.\" Then Allah revealed the words:\nلَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ\n(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.) That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَلَا إِلَى أَلْوَانِكُمْ، وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُم»\n(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.) And in the Hadith; (Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)\nكَذَلِكَ سَخَّرَهَا لَكُمْ\n(Thus have We made them subject to you) meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,'\nلِتُكَبِّرُواْ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ\n(that you may proclaim Allah's greatness for His guidance to you.) means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.\nوَبَشِّرِ الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,' i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.\n(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ continued to offer sacrifice for ten years.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: \"At the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting by sacrificing more than one and things reached the stage that you see now.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«لَا تَذْبَحُوا إِلَّا مُسِنَّةً، إِلَّا أَنْ تَعْسُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَذْبَحُوا جَذَعَةً مِنَ الضَّأْن»\n(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)"

Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; surely they are doomed.\"' Ibn `Abbas said, \"Then Allah revealed the words:\nأُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ\n(Permission (to fight) is given to those (believers) fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.)\" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Then I knew that there would be fighting.\" Imam Ahmad added: \"Ibn `Abbas said, `This was the first Ayah to be revealed concerning fighting.\"' This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the Book of Tafsir of their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said: \"It is a Hasan Hadith.\"\nوَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ\n(and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.) means, He is able to grant victory to His believing servants without any fighting taking place, but He wants His servants to strive their utmost in obeying Him, as He says:\nفَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّى إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ - سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ - وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ\n(So, when you meet those who disbelieve, strike necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly. Thereafter either for generosity, or ransom, until war lays down its burden. Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them. But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them.) 47:4-6\nقَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ\n(Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people, and remove the anger of their (believers') hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) 9:14-15\nوَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّى نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّـبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَـرَكُمْ\n(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard and the patient, and We shall test your facts.) 47:31. And there are many similar Ayat. Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,\nوَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ\n(and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.) \"And this is what He did.\" Allah prescribed Jihad at an appropriate time, because when they were in Makkah, the idolators outnumbered them by more than ten to one. Were they to engage in fighting at that time, the results would have been disastrous. When the idolators went to extremes to persecute Muslims, to expel the Prophet and resolving to kill him; when they sent his Companions into exile here and there, so that some went to Ethiopia and others went to Al-Madinah; when they settled in Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ joined them there, and they gathered around him and lent him their support, and they had a place where Islam prevailed, and a stronghold to which they could retreat; then Allah prescribed Jihad against the enemy, and this was the first Ayah to be revealed for it. Allah said:\nأُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ\n(Permission (to fight) is given to those fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said; \"They were driven out of Makkah to Al-Madinah unjustly, i.e., Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions.\"\nإِلاَّ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ\n(only because they said: \"Our Lord is Allah.\") means, they had not done anything to their people or committed any wrongs against them, apart from the fact that they believed in the Oneness of Allah and they worshipped Him Alone, with no partner or associate. But for the idolators, this was the worst of sins, as Allah says:\nيُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ أَن تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ\n(and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) 60:1. Then Allah says:\nوَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ\n(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another,) meaning, were it not for the fact that He repels one people by means of another, and restrains the evil of people towards others by means of whatever circumstances He creates and decrees, the earth would have been corrupted and the strong would have destroyed the weak.\nلَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَمِعُ\n(Sawami` surely have been pulled down) means the small temples used by monks. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Qatadah said, \"This refers to the places of worship of the Sabians;\" according to another report, he said, \"The Sawami` of the Zoroastrians.\" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"These are houses along the roads.\"\nوَبِيَعٌ\n(Biya`.) These are larger than the Sawami` and accommodate more worshippers; the Christians also have these. This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Sakhr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Khusayf and others. Ibn Jubayr reported from Mujahid and others that this referred to the synagogues of the Jews which are known to them as Salut. And Allah knows best.\nوَصَلَوَتِ\n(Salawat) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Salawat means churches.\" `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said that it referred to the synagogues of the Jews. Abu Al-`Aliyah and others said, \"Salawat refers to the places of worship of the Sabians.\" Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"Salawat refers to places of worship of the People of the Book and of the people of Islam along the roads.\" Masjids belong to the Muslims.\nيُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً\n(wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much,) It was said that the pronoun refers to Masjids, because this is the closest of the words mentioned. Ad-Dahhak said, \"In all of them the Name of Allah is often mentioned.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"The correct view is that the monasteries of the monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and the Masjids of the Muslims, in which the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would have been destroyed -- because this is the usual usage in Arabic.\" Some of the scholars said, \"This is a sequence listing the smallest to the greatest, because the Masjids are more frequented by more worshippers who have the correct intention and way.\"\nوَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ\n(Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause).) This is like the Ayah:\nيأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ - وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ\n(O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.) 47:7-8\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) Allah describes Himself as being All-Strong and All-Mighty. By His strength He created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements; by His might nothing can overpower Him or overwhelm Him, rather everything is humbled before Him and is in need of Him. Whoever is supported by the All-Strong, the All-Mighty, is indeed supported and helped, and his enemy will be overpowered. Allah says:\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our soldiers! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) 58:21"

This is the state of the followers of innovation and misguidance, who turn away from the truth and follow falsehood, following the words of the leaders of misguidance who call people to follow innovation and their own desires and opinions. Allah says concerning them and their like,\nوَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ\n(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge,) meaning, without sound knowledge.\nوَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍكُتِبَ عَلَيْهِ\n(and follows every rebellious Shaytan. For him it is decreed.)

Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) 11:102 Then Allah says:\nفَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا\n(And many a township did We destroy)\nوَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ\n(while they were given wrongdoing,) meaning, they were rejecting their Messengers.\nفَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا\n(so that it lie in ruins,) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Leveled to their roofs,\" i.e., their houses and cities were destroyed.\nوَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ\n(and (many) a deserted well) means, they draw no water from it, and no one comes to it, after it had been frequented often by crowds of people.\nوَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ\n(and a castle Mashid!) `Ikrimah said, \"This means whitened with plaster.\" Something similar was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib, Mujahid, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Mulayh and Ad-Dahhak. Others said that it means high and impenetrable fortresses. All of these suggestions are close in meaning and do not contradict one another, for this sturdy construction and great height did not help their occupants or afford them any protection when the punishment of Allah came upon them, as He says:\nأَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ\n(\"Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in Buruj Mushayyadah!\") 4:78\nأَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Have they not traveled through the land,) means, have they not traveled in the physical sense and also used their minds to ponder That is sufficient, as Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya said in his book At-Tafakkur wal-I`tibar, \"Some of the wise people said, `Give life to your heart with lessons, illuminate it with thought, kill it with asceticism, strengthen it with certain faith, remind it of its mortality, make it aware of the calamities of this world, warn it of the disasters that life may bring, show it how things may suddenly change with the passing of days, tell it the stories of the people of the past, and remind it what happened to those who came before.\"' Walk through their ruins, see what they did and what became of them, meaning, look at the punishments and divine wrath that struck the nations of the past who belied,\nفَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا\n(and have they hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear) meaning, let them learn a lesson from that.\nفَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ\n(Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) means, the blind person is not the one whose eyes cannot see, but rather the one who has no insight. Even if the physical eyes are sound, they still cannot learn the lesson."

This is like the Ayat:\nوَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.\") 8:32 H\nوَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْحِسَابِ\n(They say: \"Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana (our punishment) before the Day of Reckoning!\") 38:16.\nوَلَن يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ\n(And Allah fails not His promise.) means, His promise to bring about the Hour and wreak vengeance upon His enemies, and to honor His close friends.\nوَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ\n(And verily a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon. ) means, He does not hasten, for what is counted as a thousand years with His creation is as one day with Him, and He knows that He is able to exact revenge and that He will not miss a thing, even if He delays and waits and postpones. Hence He then says:\nوَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ\n(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing.

This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i from the Hadith of Ath-Thawri from Muhammad bin `Amr. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Abu Dawud recorded at the end of Book of Al-Malahim in his Sunan from Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas that the Prophet said:\n«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ لَا تَعْجِزَ أُمَّتِي عِنْدَ رَبِّهَا أَنْ يُؤَخِّرَهُمْ نِصْفَ يَوْم»\n(I hope that it will not be too much for my Ummah if Allah delays them for half a day.) It was said to Sa`d, \"What does half a day mean\" He said, \"Five hundred years.\""

In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Abu Musa that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»\n(Allah lets the wrongdoer carry on until, when He seizes him, He will never let him go.) Then he recited:\nوَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ\n(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) 11:102 Then Allah says:\nفَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا\n(And many a township did We destroy)\nوَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ\n(while they were given wrongdoing,) meaning, they were rejecting their Messengers.\nفَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا\n(so that it lie in ruins,) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Leveled to their roofs,\" i.e., their houses and cities were destroyed.\nوَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ\n(and (many) a deserted well) means, they draw no water from it, and no one comes to it, after it had been frequented often by crowds of people.\nوَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ\n(and a castle Mashid!) `Ikrimah said, \"This means whitened with plaster.\" Something similar was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib, Mujahid, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Mulayh and Ad-Dahhak. Others said that it means high and impenetrable fortresses. All of these suggestions are close in meaning and do not contradict one another, for this sturdy construction and great height did not help their occupants or afford them any protection when the punishment of Allah came upon them, as He says:\nأَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ\n(\"Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in Buruj Mushayyadah!\") 4:78\nأَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Have they not traveled through the land,) means, have they not traveled in the physical sense and also used their minds to ponder That is sufficient, as Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya said in his book At-Tafakkur wal-I`tibar, \"Some of the wise people said, `Give life to your heart with lessons, illuminate it with thought, kill it with asceticism, strengthen it with certain faith, remind it of its mortality, make it aware of the calamities of this world, warn it of the disasters that life may bring, show it how things may suddenly change with the passing of days, tell it the stories of the people of the past, and remind it what happened to those who came before.\"' Walk through their ruins, see what they did and what became of them, meaning, look at the punishments and divine wrath that struck the nations of the past who belied,\nفَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا\n(and have they hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear) meaning, let them learn a lesson from that.\nفَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ\n(Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) means, the blind person is not the one whose eyes cannot see, but rather the one who has no insight. Even if the physical eyes are sound, they still cannot learn the lesson.\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَلَن يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ - وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ\n(47.

Allah says:\nيَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ\n(O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection,) which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection,\nفَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ\n(then verily, We have created you from dust,) meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from.\nثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ\n(then from a Nutfah,) 32:8 meaning, then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.\nThe Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb\nثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ\n(then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh) if the Nutfah establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says:\nثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ\n(then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed) meaning, as you see.\nلِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(that We may make (it) clear to you.

When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us:\n«إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»\n(Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.)\"\nMan's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;\nثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً\n(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:\nثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ\n(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.\nوَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى\n(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.\nوَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ\n(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:\nلِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً\n(so that he knows nothing after having known.)\nاللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ\n(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) 30:54\nAnother Parable of the Resurrection from Plants\nوَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ هَامِدَةً\n(And you see the earth Hamidatan,) This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. Qatadah said, \"(This means) the eroded, dusty earth.\" As-Suddi said, \"Dead.\"\nفَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. Allah says:\nوَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.\nذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ\n(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.\nوَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى\n(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.\nإِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39\nإِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ\n(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" -- and it is!) 36:82.\nوَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا\n(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.\nوَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ\n(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.\nوَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ\nقُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ\n(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation.

He is the One Who does whatsoever He wills and wants and chooses.\nلاَ مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ\n(There is none to put back His judgement and He is swift at reckoning.) 13:41\nإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌفَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(I am (sent) to you only as a plain warner. So those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) means, whose hearts believe and whose actions confirm their faith.\nلَّهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ\n(for them is forgiveness and Rizq Karim. ) means, forgiveness for their previous bad deeds, and a great reward in return for a few good deeds. Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said, \"When you hear Allah's saying:\nوَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ\n(Rizq Karim) this means Paradise.\"\nوَالَّذِينَ سَعَوْاْ فِى ءَايَـتِنَا مُعَـجِزِينَ\n(But those who strive against Our Ayat to frustrate them,) Mujahid said, \"To discourage people from following the Prophet .\" This was also the view of `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, \"to discourage.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"To frustrate them means to resist the believers stubbornly.\"\nأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ\n(they will be dwellers of the Hellfire.) This refers to the agonizingly hot Fire with its severe punish- ment, may Allah save us from it. Allah says:\nالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يُفْسِدُونَ\n(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption) 16:88"

      "text": "Evidence of the Resurrection in the creation of Man and of Plants\nWhen Allah speaks of disbelief in the Resurrection, He also mentions the evidence of His power and ability to resurrect that is evident from the way He initiates creation. Allah says:\nيَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ\n(O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection,) which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection,\nفَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ\n(then verily, We have created you from dust,) meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from.\nثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ\n(then from a Nutfah,) 32:8 meaning, then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.\nThe Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb\nثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ\n(then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh) if the Nutfah establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says:\nثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ\n(then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed) meaning, as you see.\nلِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term,) meaning that sometimes the fetus remains in the womb and is not miscarried.\nمُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ\n(some formed and some unformed, ) Mujahid said, \"This means the miscarried fetus, formed or unformed. When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us:\n«إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»\n(Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.)\"\nMan's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;\nثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً\n(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:\nثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ\n(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.\nوَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى\n(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.\nوَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ\n(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:\nلِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً\n(so that he knows nothing after having known.)\nاللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ\n(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) 30:54\nAnother Parable of the Resurrection from Plants\nوَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ هَامِدَةً\n(And you see the earth Hamidatan,) This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. Qatadah said, \"(This means) the eroded, dusty earth.\" As-Suddi said, \"Dead.\"\nفَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. Allah says:\nوَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.\nذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ\n(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.\nوَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى\n(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.\nإِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39\nإِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ\n(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" -- and it is!) 36:82.\nوَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا\n(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.\nوَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ\n(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.\nوَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ\nقُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ\n(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: \"Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust\" Say: \"He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!\" He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle there- with.) 36:78-80. And there are many similar Ayat.\nومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ"

Fadalah bin `Ubayd sat by the grave of the man who had passed away and someone said to him, \"Are you neglecting the martyr and not sitting by his grave\" He said, \"I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from, for Allah says:\nوَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُواْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً\n(Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)\" And he recited these two Ayat, then said, \"What should I seek, O you servant, if I were to enter an entrance to His pleasure, and be provided good provisions By Allah, I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from.\"\nذلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ\n(That is so. And whoever has retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer....) Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators. The Muslims urged them not to fight during the Sacred Months, but the idolators insisted on fighting and initiated the aggression. So the Muslims fought them and Allah granted them victory.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ\n(Verily, Allah indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.)"

If it be equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Verily, Allah is Subtle, Well-Aware.) 31:16 And Allah says:\nأَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ الَّذِى يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(...so they do not worship Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth.) 27:25\nوَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(not a leaf falls, but He knows it.

In the raging sea with its tempestuous waves, the ships sail gently with their passengers and carry them wherever they want to go for trading and other purposes from one land to another, so that they bring goods from here to there, or vice versa, whatever people want or need.\nوَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ\n(He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His leave.) If He willed, He could give the sky permission to fall on the earth, and whoever is in it would be killed, but by His kindness, mercy and power, He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth, except by His leave. He says:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(Verily, Allah is for mankind, full of kindness, Most Merciful.) meaning, even though they do wrong. As Allah says elsewhere:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing.

Verily, man is indeed Kafurun.) This is like the Ayat:\nكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life and then unto Him you will return.) 2:28,\nقُلِ اللَّهُ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(Say: \"Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.\") 45:26,\nقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ\n(They will say: \"Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!\") 40:11 So how can you set up rivals to Allah and worship others besides Him when He is the One Who is independent in His powers of creation, provision and control of the existence\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى أَحْيَاكُمْ\n(It is He, Who gave you life,) means, He gave you life after you were nothing, and brought you into existence.\nثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ\n(and then will cause you to die, and will again give you life.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.\nإِنَّ الإِنْسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ\n(Verily, man is indeed Kafurun.) meaning, denying."

Verily, Allah is Subtle, Well-Aware.) 31:16 And Allah says:\nأَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ الَّذِى يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(...so they do not worship Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth.) 27:25\nوَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.) 6:59\nوَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَن رَّبِّكَ مِن مِّثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى السَّمَآءِ وَلاَ أَصْغَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْبَرَ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(And nothing is hidden from your Lord, the weight of a speck of dust on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but it is (written) in a Clear Record.) 10:61\nلَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَت وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.) He owns all things, and He has no need of anything besides Himself, everything is in need of Him and in a state of submission to Him.\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(See you not that Allah has subjected to you all that is on the earth,) animals, inanimate things, crops and fruits. This is like the Ayah:\nوَسَخَّرَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً مِّنْهُ\n(And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) 45:13, meaning that all of this is a blessing and out of His kindness.\nوَالْفُلْكَ تَجْرِى فِى الْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ\n(and the ships that sail through the sea by His command) That is because He subjugates it to them and makes it easy for them. In the raging sea with its tempestuous waves, the ships sail gently with their passengers and carry them wherever they want to go for trading and other purposes from one land to another, so that they bring goods from here to there, or vice versa, whatever people want or need.\nوَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ\n(He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His leave.) If He willed, He could give the sky permission to fall on the earth, and whoever is in it would be killed, but by His kindness, mercy and power, He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth, except by His leave. He says:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(Verily, Allah is for mankind, full of kindness, Most Merciful.) meaning, even though they do wrong. As Allah says elsewhere:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is severe in punishment) 13:6.\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى أَحْيَاكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ إِنَّ الإِنْسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ\n(It is He, Who gave you life, and then will cause you to die, and will again give you life. Verily, man is indeed Kafurun.) This is like the Ayat:\nكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life and then unto Him you will return.) 2:28,\nقُلِ اللَّهُ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(Say: \"Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.\") 45:26,\nقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ\n(They will say: \"Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!\") 40:11 So how can you set up rivals to Allah and worship others besides Him when He is the One Who is independent in His powers of creation, provision and control of the existence\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى أَحْيَاكُمْ\n(It is He, Who gave you life,) means, He gave you life after you were nothing, and brought you into existence.\nثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ\n(and then will cause you to die, and will again give you life.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.\nإِنَّ الإِنْسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ\n(Verily, man is indeed Kafurun.) meaning, denying."

This is like the Ayah:\nثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً\n(Then We made the Nutfah into a clot , then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh) 23:14. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that between each stage there are forty days. Allah's saying,\nفَتُصْبِحُ الاٌّرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً\n(and then the earth becomes green) means, it becomes green after being dry and lifeless. It was reported from some of the people of Al-Hijaz that the land turns green after rainfall. And Allah knows best.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ\n(Verily, Allah is the Most Kind and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things.)

Each of those seeds receives its share of water and begins to grow, as Luqman said:\nيبُنَىَّ إِنَّهَآ إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ فَتَكُنْ فِى صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ أَوْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا اللَّهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ\n(\"O my son!

As Allah says elsewhere:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing.

Verily, man is indeed Kafurun.) This is like the Ayat:\nكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life.

Allah says:\nيَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ\n(O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection,) which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection,\nفَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ\n(then verily, We have created you from dust,) meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from.\nثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ\n(then from a Nutfah,) 32:8 meaning, then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.\nThe Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb\nثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ\n(then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh) if the Nutfah establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says:\nثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ\n(then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed) meaning, as you see.\nلِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term,) meaning that sometimes the fetus remains in the womb and is not miscarried.\nمُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ\n(some formed and some unformed, ) Mujahid said, \"This means the miscarried fetus, formed or unformed. When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us:\n«إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»\n(Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.)\"\nMan's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;\nثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً\n(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:\nثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ\n(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.\nوَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى\n(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.\nوَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ\n(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:\nلِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً\n(so that he knows nothing after having known.)\nاللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ\n(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) 30:54\nAnother Parable of the Resurrection from Plants\nوَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ هَامِدَةً\n(And you see the earth Hamidatan,) This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. Qatadah said, \"(This means) the eroded, dusty earth.\" As-Suddi said, \"Dead.\"\nفَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. Allah says:\nوَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.\nذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ\n(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.\nوَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى\n(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.\nإِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39\nإِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ\n(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" -- and it is!) 36:82.\nوَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا\n(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.\nوَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ\n(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.\nوَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ\nقُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ\n(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: \"Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust\" Say: \"He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!\" He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle there- with.) 36:78-80. And there are many similar Ayat.\nومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ"

He said to it, \"Write!\" It said, \"What should I write\" He said, \"Write what will happen,\" so the Pen wrote everything that will happen until the Day of Resurrection.) Allah says:\nإِنَّ ذلِكَ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ\n(Verily, it is (all) in the Book. Verily, that is easy for Allah.)"

Even if all the idols and false gods whom you worship were to come together to create a single fly, they would not be able to do that. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah recorded the Marfu` report:\n«وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ (خَلْقًا) كَخَلْقِي، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا مِثْلَ خَلْقِي ذَرَّةً أَوْ ذُبَابَةً أَوْ حَبَّة»\n(\"Who does more wrong than one who tries to create something like My creation Let them create an ant or a fly or a seed like My creation!\") This was also recorded by the authors of the Two Sahihs via `Umarah from Abu Zur`ah from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said: a\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ ذَهَبَ يَخْلُقُ كَخَلْقِي، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا ذَرَّةً، فَلْيَخْلُقُوا شَعِيرَة»\n(Allah says: \"Who does more wrong than one who tries to create (something) like My creation Let them create an ant, let them create a grain of barley.\") Then Allah says:\nوَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ الذُّبَابُ شَيْئاً لاَّ يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ\n(And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly.)

      "text": "The Command to worship Allah and engage in Jihad\nIt was reported from `Uqbah bin `Amir that the Prophet said:\n«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ بِسَجْدَتَيْنِ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْجُدْهُمَا فَلَا يَقْرَأْهُمَا»\n(Surat Al-Hajj has been blessed with two Sajdahs, so whoever does not prostrate them should not read them.)\nوَجَـهِدُوا فِى اللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَـدِهِ\n(And strive hard in Allah's cause as you ought to strive.) means, with your wealth and your tongues and your bodies. This is like the Ayah:\nاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ\n(Have Taqwa of Allah as is His due.) 3:102\nهُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ\n(He has chosen you,) means, `O Ummah of Islam, Allah has selected you and chosen you over all other nations, and has favored you and blessed you and honored you with the noblest of Messengers and the noblest of Laws.'\nوَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) He has not given you more than you can bear and He has not obliged you to do anything that will cause you difficulty except that He has created for you a way out. So the Salah, which is the most important pillar of Islam after the two testimonies of faith, is obligatory, four Rak`ahs when one is settled, which are shortened to two Rak`ah when one is traveling. According to some Imams, only one Rak`ahs is obligatory at times of fear, as was recorded in the Hadith. A person may pray while walking or riding, facing the Qiblah or otherwise. When praying optional prayers while traveling, one may face the Qiblah or not. A person is not obliged to stand during the prayer if he is sick; the sick person may pray sitting down, and if he is not able to do that then he may pray lying on his side. And there are other exemptions and dispensations which may apply to the obligatory prayers and other duties. So the Prophet said:\n«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»\n(I have been sent with the easy Hanifi way.) And he said to Mu`adh and Abu Musa, when he sent them as governors to Yemen:\n«بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرا وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا»\n(Give good news and do not repel them. Make things easy for the people and do not make the things difficult for them.) And there are many similar Hadiths. Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah,\nوَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship), \"This means difficulty.\"\nمِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ\n(It is the religion of your father Ibrahim. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This refers back to the Ayah,\nوَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) meaning, any difficulty.\" On the contrary, He has made it easy for you, like the religion of your father Ibrahim. He said, \"It may be that it means: adhere to the religion of your father Ibrahim.\" I say: This interpretation of the Ayah is like the Ayah:\nقُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا\n(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif) 6:161\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا\n(He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an),) Imam `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj, from `Ata', from Ibn `Abbas: concerning Allah's saying,\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ\n(He has named you Muslims before) \"This refers to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Qatadah. Mujahid said, \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous Books and in Adh-Dhikr,\nوَفِى هَـذَا\n(and in this) means, the Qur'an.\" This was also the view of others, because Allah says:\nهُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) Then He urged them to follow the Message which His Messenger brought, by reminding them that this was the religion of their father Ibrahim. Then He mentioned His blessings to this Ummah, whereby He mentioned them and praised them long ago in the Books of the Prophets which were recited to the rabbis and monks. Allah says:\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ\n(He has named you Muslims both before) meaning, before the Qur'an,\nوَفِى هَـذَا\n(and in this.) Under the explanation of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded from Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:\n«مَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ جِثِيِّ جَهَنَّم»\n(Whoever adopts the call of Jahiliyyah, will be one of those who will crawl on their knees in Hell.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, even if he fasts and performs Salah\" He said,\n«نَعَمْ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى ، فَادْعُوا بِدَعْوَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي سَمَّاكُمْ بِهَا الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»\n(Yes, even if he fasts and performs Salah. So adopt the call of Allah whereby He called you Muslims and believers and servants of Allah.)\nلِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ\n(that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) means, `thus We have made you a just and fair nation, the best of nations, and all other nations will testify to your justice. On the Day of Resurrection you will be,\nشُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ\n(witnesses over mankind),' because on that Day all the nations will acknowledge its leadership and its precedence over all others. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection the testimony of the members of this community will be accepted as proof that the Messengers ﷺ conveyed the Message of their Lord to them, and the Messenger will testify that he conveyed the Message to them.\nفَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ\n(So perform the Salah, give Zakah) means, respond to this great blessing with gratitude by fulfilling your duties towards Allah, doing that which He has enjoined upon you and avoiding that which He had forbidden. Among the most important duties are establishing regular prayer and giving Zakah. Zakah is a form of beneficence towards Allah's creatures, whereby He has enjoined upon the rich to give a little of their wealth to the poor each year, to help the weak and needy. We have already mentioned its explanation in the Ayah of Zakah in Surat At-Tawbah (9:5).\nوَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِاللَّهِ\n(and hold fast to Allah.) means, seek the help and support of Allah and put your trust in Him, and get strength from Him.\nهُوَ مَوْلَـكُمْ\n(He is your Mawla,) meaning, He is your Protector and your Helper, He is the One Who will cause you to prevail against your enemies.\nفَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ\n(what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper!) He is the best Mawla and the best Helper against your enemies. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hajj. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family and Companions, and grant them peace; may Allah honor and be pleased with the Companions and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Resurrection."

Allah's saying,\nثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ\n(Bending his neck in pride,) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"Too proud to follow the truth when he is called to it.\" Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:\nثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ\n(Bending his neck in pride,) means, twisting his neck, i.e., turning away from the truth to which he is called, bending his neck out of pride and arrogance. This is like the Ayat:\nوَفِى مُوسَى إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ\n(And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority.

This is like the Ayah:\nخُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ\n((It will be said: ) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\") 44:47-50"
