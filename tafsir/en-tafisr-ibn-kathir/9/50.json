Allah directed His Prophet to reply to the perfect enmity they have towards him,\nقُلْ\n(Say), to them,\nلَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَنَا\n(Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us.) for we are under His control and decree,\nهُوَ مَوْلَـنَا\n(He is our Mawla.), Master and protector,\nوَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ\n(And in Allah let the believers put their trust) 9:51, and we trust in Him. Verily, He is sufficient for us and what an excellent guardian.",
