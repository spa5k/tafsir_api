  "text": "Hypocrites annoy the Prophet\nAllah says, some hypocrites bother the Messenger of Allah ﷺ by questioning his character, saying,\nهُوَ أُذُنٌ\n(he is (lending his) ear), to those who say anything about us; he believes whoever talks to him. Therefore, if we went to him and swore, he would believe us. Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. Allah said,\nقُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَّكُمْ\n(Say: \"He listens to what is best for you\"), he knows who's saying the truth and who is lying,\nيُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(he believes in Allah; has faith in the believers), he believes the believers,\nوَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ\n(and is a mercy to those of you who believe\"), and a proof against the disbelievers,\nوَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(But those who annoy Allah's Messenger, will have a painful torment.)",
