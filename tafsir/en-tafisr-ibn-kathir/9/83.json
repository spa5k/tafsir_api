Allah mentioned the reason for this decision,\nإِنَّكُمْ رَضِيتُمْ بِالْقُعُودِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ\n(\"You were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion...\") Allah said in a similar Ayah,\nوَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ\n(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time. ) 6:110 The recompense of an evil deed includes being directed to follow it with another evil deed, while the reward of a good deed includes being directed to another good deed after it. For instance, Allah said concerning the `Umrah of Hudaybiyyah,\nسَيَقُولُ الْمُخَلَّفُونَ إِذَا انطَلَقْتُمْ إِلَى مَغَانِمَ لِتَأْخُذُوهَا\n(Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils.)48:15 Allah said next,\nفَاقْعُدُواْ مَعَ الْخَـلِفِينَ\n(\"...then you sit (now) with those who lag behind.\") in reference to the men who lagged behind from Tabuk battle, according to Ibn `Abbas.",
