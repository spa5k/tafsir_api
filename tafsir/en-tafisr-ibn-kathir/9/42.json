  "text": "Why Hypocrites would not join in Jihad\nAllah admonishes those who lagged behind and did not join the Prophet for the battle of Tabuk, those who asked the Prophet for permission to remain behind, falsely pretending to have legitimate reasons to do so,\nلَوْ كَانَ عَرَضًا قَرِيبًا\n(Had it been a near gain), booty right in front of them, according to Ibn `Abbas,\nوَسَفَرًا قَاصِدًا\n(and an easy journey), travel for only a short distance,\nلاَّتَّبَعُوكَ\n(they would have followed you.) But,\nوَلَـكِن بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّقَّةُ\n(the distance was long for them), to Ash-Sham,\nوَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ\n(and they would swear by Allah), when you return to them,\nلَوِ اسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ\n(If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you), had not there been a valid excuse, we would have gone out with you,\nيُهْلِكُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ\n(They destroy themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.)",
