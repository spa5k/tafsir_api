  "text": "Moderately criticizing the Prophet for allowing the Hypocrites to stay behind\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that `Awn said, \"Have you heard criticism softer than this, starting with forgiveness before criticism,\nعَفَا اللَّهُ عَنكَ لِمَ أَذِنتَ لَهُمْ\n(May Allah forgive you. Why did you grant them leave...)\" Muwarriq Al-`Ijli and others said similarly. Qatadah said, \"Allah criticized him as you read here, then later revealed to him the permission to allow them to lag behind if he wants, in Surat An-Nur,\nفَإِذَا اسْتَـْذَنُوكَ لِبَعْضِ شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَن لِّمَن شِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ\n(So if they ask your permission for some affairs of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them) 24:62.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said similarly. Mujahid said, \"This Ayah was revealed about some people who said, `Ask permission from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to stay behind, and whether he agrees, or disagrees, remain behind!\"' Allah said,\nحَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ\n(...until those who told the truth were manifest to you), in reference to valid excuses,\nوَتَعْلَمَ الْكَـذِبِينَ\n(and you had known the liars) Allah says, `Why did you not refuse to give them permission to remain behind when they asked you, so that you know those who truly obey you and the liars, who were intent on remaining behind even if you do not give them permission to do so, Allah asserts that none who believe in Allah and His Messenger seek his permission to remain behind from fighting,\nلاَ يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ\n(would not ask your leave), to stay behind from Jihad,\nالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ أَن يُجَـهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ\n(Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, to be exempted from fighting with their properties and their lives.) because they consider Jihad an act of worship. This is why when Allah called them to perform Jihad, they obeyed and hasten to act in His obedience,\nوَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالْمُتَّقِينَإِنَّمَا يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ\n(and Allah is the All-Knower of those who have Taqwa. Those who ask your leave), to remain behind, without a valid excuse,\nالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ\n(those who believe not in Allah and the Last Day), they do not hope for Allah's reward in the Hereafter for their good actions,\nوَارْتَابَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ\n(and whose hearts are in doubt), about the validity of what you brought them,\nفَهُمْ فِى رَيْبِهِمْ يَتَرَدَّدُونَ\n(so in their doubts they waver.) They waver in doubt, taking one step forward and one step back. They do not have a firm stance in anything, for they are unsure and destroyed, neither belonging to these nor to those. Verily, those whom Allah misguides, will never find a way for themselves to guidance.",
