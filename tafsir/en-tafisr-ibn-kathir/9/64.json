  "text": "The Hypocrites fear Public Exposure of Their Secrets\nMujahid said, \"The hypocrites would say something to each other then declare, `We wish that Allah does not expose this secret of ours,\" There is a similar Ayah to this one, that is, Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ وَيَقُولُونَ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ\n(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: \"Why should Allah punish us not for what we say\" Hell will be sufficient for them; they will burn therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) 58:8. Allah said in this Ayah,\nقُلِ اسْتَهْزِءُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا تَحْذَرُونَ\n(Say: \"(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.\"), He will expose and explain your reality to His Messenger through revelation. Allah said in other Ayat,\nأَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ أَن لَّن يُخْرِجَ اللَّهُ أَضْغَـنَهُمْ\n(Or do those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy), think that Allah will not bring to light all their hidden ill-wills) 47:29, until,\nوَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ\n(but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!)47:30. This is why, according to Qatadah, this Surah is called `Al-Fadihah' (the Exposing), because it exposed the hypocrites.",
