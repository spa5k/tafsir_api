  "text": "Exposing Hypocrites' Fright and Fear\nAllah describes to His Prophet the fright, fear, anxiety and nervousness of the hypocrites,\nيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِإِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ\n(They swear by Allah that they are truly of you), swearing a sure oath,\nوَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ\n(while they are not of you), in reality,\nوَلَـكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ\n(but they are a people who are afraid), and this is what made them swear.\nلَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً\n(Should they find a refuge), such as a fort in which they hide and fortify themselves,\nأَوْ مَغَـرَاتٍ\n(or caves), in some mountains,\nأَوْ مُدَّخَلاً\n(or a place of concealment), a tunnel or a hole in the ground, according to the explanation given by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah,\nلَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ\n(they would turn straightway thereto with a swift rush) away from you because they associate with you unwillingly, not because they are fond of you. They prefer that they do not have to mix with you, but necessity has its rules! It is because of this that they feel grief, sadness and sorrow, seeing Islam and its people enjoying ever more might, triumph and glory. Therefore, whatever pleases Muslims brings them grief, and this is why they prefer to disassociate themselves from the believers. Hence Allah's statement,\nلَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً أَوْ مَغَـرَاتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلاً لَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ\n(Should they find a refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto with a swift rush.)\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَلْمِزُكَ فِي الصَّدَقَـتِ فَإِنْ أُعْطُواْ مِنْهَا رَضُواْ وَإِن لَّمْ يُعْطَوْاْ مِنهَا إِذَا هُمْ يَسْخَطُونَ",
