We stated that every Surah that starts with separate letters, affirms that the Qur'an is miraculous and is an evidence that it is a revelation from Allah, and that there is no doubt or denying in this fact. This is why Allah said next,\nتِلْكَ آيَـتُ الْكِتَـبِ\n(These are the verses of the Book), the Qur'an, which Allah described afterwards,\nوَالَّذِى أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ\n(and that which has been revealed unto you), O Muhammad,\nمِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ\n(from your Lord is the truth,) Allah said next,\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(but most men believe not.) just as He said in another Ayah,\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) 12:103 Allah declares that even after this clear, plain and unequivocal explanation (the Qur'an), most men will still not believe, due to their rebellion, stubbornness and hypocrisy.\nاللَّهُ الَّذِى رَفَعَ السَّمَـوَتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّـى يُدَبَّرُ الاٌّمْرَ يُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ"

Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى\n(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.)20:7, and,\nوَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ\n(And (Allah) knows what you conceal and what you reveal.) `A'ishah said, \"All praise is due to Allah Whose hearing has encompassed all voices! By Allah, she who came to complain about her husband to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was speaking while I was in another part of the room, yet I did not hear some of what she said. Allah sent down,\nقَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِى إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ\n(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband and complains to Allah.

They guard him by the command of Allah.) Allah states that there are angels who take turns guarding each servant, some by night and some by day. These angels protect each person from harm and accidents. There are also angels who take turns recording the good and evil deeds, some angels do this by day and some by night. There are two angels, one to the right and one to the left of each person, recording the deeds. The angel to the right records the good deeds, while the angel to the left records the evil deeds. There are also two angels that guard and protect each person, one from the back and one from in front. Therefore, there are four angels that surround each person by day and they are replaced by four others at night, two scribes and two guards. An authentic Hadith states,\n«يَتَعَاقَبُونَ فِيكُمْ مَلَائِكَةٌ بِاللَّيْلِ وَمَلَائِكَةٌ بالنَّهَارِ، وَيَجْتَمِعُونَ فِي صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ وَصَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ، فَيَصْعَدُ إِلَيْهِ الَّذِينَ بَاتُوا فِيكُمْ فَيَسْأَلُهُمْ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ: كَيْفَ تَرَكْتُمْ عِبَادِي؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَتَيْنَاهُمْ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ، وَتَرَكْنَاهُمْ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّون»\n(Angels take turns around you, some at night and some by day, and all of them assemble together at the time of the Fajr and `Asr prayers. Then those who have stayed with you throughout the night, ascend to Allah Who asks them, and He knows the answer better than they about you, \"How have you left My servants\" They reply, \"As we have found them praying, we have left them praying.\") Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَقَدْ وُكِّلَ بِهِ قَرِينُهُ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَقَرِينُهُ مِنَ الْمَلَائِكَة»\n(Verily, every one among you has his companion from the Jinn and his companion from the angels.\") They said, \"And you too, O Allah's Messenger\" He said,\n«وَإِيَّايَ، وَلَكِنَّ اللهَ أَعَانَنِي عَلَيْهِ، فَلَا يَأْمُرُنِي إِلَّا بِخَيْر»\n(And I too, except that Allah has helped me against him, so he only orders me to do good.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibrahim said, \"Allah revealed to a Prophet from among the Children of Israel, `Say to your nation: every people of a village or a house who used to obey Allah but changed their behavior to disobeying Him, then He will take away from them what they like and exchange it for what they dislike.\" Ibrahim next said that this statement has proof in Allah's Book,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُواْ مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ\n(Verily, Allah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves.)"

      "text": "Clouds, Thunder and Lightning are Signs of Allah's Power\nAllah states that He has full power over Al-Barq (lightning), which is the bright light that originates from within clouds. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas once wrote to Abu Al-Jald asking about the meaning of Al-Barq, and he said that it is water. Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,\nخَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا\n(as a fear and as a hope.) \"Fear for travelers, for they feel afraid of its harm and hardship, and hope for residents, awaiting its blessing and benefit and anticipating Allah's provisions.\" Allah said next,\nوَيُنْشِىءُ السَّحَابَ الثِّقَالَ\n(And it is He Who brings up the clouds, heavy.) meaning, He originates the clouds that are heavy and close to the ground because of being laden with rain. Mujahid said that this part of the Ayah is about clouds that are heavy with rain. Allah's statement,\nوَيُسَبِّحُ الرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ\n(And Ar-Ra'd (thunder) glorifies and praises Him), is similar to His other statement,\nوَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ\n(And there is not a thing but glorifies His praise.) 17:44 Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibrahim bin Sa`d said, \"My father told me that he was sitting next to Hamid bin `Abdur Rahman in the Masjid. A man from the tribe of Ghifar passed and Hamid sent someone to him to please come to them. When he came, Hamid said to me, `My nephew! Make space for him between me and you, for he had accompanied Allah's Messenger ﷺ.' When that man came, he sat between me and Hamid and Hamid said to him, `What was the Hadith that you narrated to me from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ' He said, `A man from Ghifar said that he heard the Prophet say, i\n«إِنَّ اللهَ يُنْشِىءُ السَّحَابَ فَيَنْطِقُ أَحْسَنَ النُّطْقِ، وَيَضْحَكُ أَحْسَنَ الضَّحِك»\n(Verily, Allah originates the clouds, and they speak in the most beautiful voice and laugh in the most beautiful manner.) It appears, and Allah has the best knowledge, that the cloud's voice is in reference to thunder and its laughter is the lightning. Musa bin `Ubaydah narrated that Sa`d bin Ibrahim said, \"Allah sends the rain and indeed, none has a better smile than it, nor more comforting voice. Its smile is lightning and its voice is thunder.\"\nSupplicating to Allah upon hearing Ar-Ra`d (Thunder)\nImam Ahmad recorded that Salim bin `Abdullah narrated that his father said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say upon hearing the thunder and thunderbolts,\n«اللَّهُمَّ لَا تَقْتُلْنَا بِغَضَبِكَ، وَلَا تُهْلِكْنَا بِعَذَابِكَ، وَعَافِنَا قَبْل ذَلِك»\n(O Allah! Do not kill us with Your anger, nor destroy us with Your torment, and save us before that.\" This Hadith was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Bukhari in his book Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak. When `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr used to hear thunder, he would stop talking and would supplicate, \"All praise is to He Whom Ar-Ra`d (thunder) glorifies and praises, and so do the angels because of His awe.\" He would then say, \"This is a stern warning to the people of earth.\" Malik collected this Hadith in Al-Muwatta', and Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: لَوْ أَنَّ عَبِيدِي أَطَاعُونِي لَأَسْقَيْتُهُمُ الْمَطَرَ بِاللَّيْلِ، وَأَطْلَعْتُ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّمْسَ بِالنَّهَارِ، وَلَمَا أَسْمَعْتُهُمْ صَوْتَ الرَّعْد»\n(Your Lord, the Exalted and Most High, said, `Had My servants obeyed Me, I would have given them rain by night and the sun by day, and would not have made them hear the sound of the Ra`d (thunder).') Allah's statement,\nوَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ\n(He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills,) indicates that He sends thunderbolts as punishment upon whom He wills, and this is why thunderbolts increase as time comes to an end. Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that Arbad bin Qays bin Juzu' bin Julayd bin Ja`far bin Kulab, and `Amir bin At-Tufayl bin Malik came to Al-Madinah to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and sat where he was sitting. `Amir bin At-Tufayl said, \"O Muhammad! What will you give me if I embrace Islam\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَكَ مَا لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَعَلَيْكَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(You will have the rights and duties of all Muslims.) `Amir bin At-Tufayl said, \"Will you make me your successor if I embrace Islam\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لَكَ وَلَا لِقَوْمِكَ، وَلَكِنْ لَكَ أَعِنَّةَ الْخَيْل»\n(That is not your right, nor your people's right. However, I could appoint you a commander of the horsemen (i.e., war).) `Amir said, \"I am already the commander of the horsemen of Najd (in the north of Arabia). Give me control over the desert and you keep the cities.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused. When these two men were leaving the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Amir said, \"By Allah! I will fill it (Al-Madinah) with horses and men (hostile to Muslims).\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,\n«يَمْنَعُكَ الله»\n(Rather, Allah will prevent you. ) When `Amir and Arbad left, `Amir said, \"O Arbad! I will keep Muhammad busy while talking to him, so you can strike him with the sword. Verily, if you kill Muhammad, the people (Muslims) will agree to take blood money and will hate to wage war over his murder. Then we will give them the blood money.\" Arbad said, \"I will do that,\" and they went back to the Messenger ﷺ. `Amir said, \"O Muhammad! Stand next to me so that I can talk to you.\" The Messenger ﷺ stood up, and they both stood next to a wall talking to each other. Arbad wanted to grab his sword, but his hand froze when it touched the sword's handle and he could not take the sword out of its sheath. Arbad did not strike the Messenger ﷺ as `Amir suggested, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at Arbad and realized what he was doing, so he departed. When Arbad and `Amir left the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and arrived at Al-Harrah of Waqim area, they dismounted from their horses. However, Sa`d bin Mu`adh and Usayd bin Hudayr came out saying, \"Come, O enemies of Allah! May Allah curse you.\" `Amir asked, \"Who is this with you, O Sa`d\" Sa`d said, \"This is Usayd bin Hudayr.\" They fled until they reached the Riqm area, where Allah struck Arbad with a bolt of lightning and he met his demise. As for `Amir, he went on until he reached the Kharim area, where Allah sent an open ulcer that struck him. During that night, `Amir took refuge in a woman's house, from Banu Salul. `Amir kept touching his open ulcer and saying, \"An ulcer as big as a camel's hump, while I am at the house of a woman from Bani Salul, seeking to bring my death in her house!\" He rode his horse, but he died while riding it headed to his area. Allah sent down these Ayat (13:8-11) in their case,\nاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى\n(Allah knows what every female bears) until,\nوَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَالٍ\n(..and they will find besides Him no protector.) Ibn `Abbas commented, \"The angels in succession, guard Muhammad ﷺ, by the command of Allah.\" He next mentioned the demise of Arbad by Allah's command, reciting this Ayah,\nوَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَعِقَ\n(He sends the thunderbolts,)\" Allah said next,\nوَهُمْ يُجَـدِلُونَ فِى اللَّهِ\n(yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allah.) they doubt Allah's greatness and that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him,\nوَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ\n(And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment.) Allah's torment is severe against those who rebel against Him, defy Him and persist in disbelief, according to the Tafsir of Ibn Jarir At-Tabari. There is a similar Ayah in the Qur'an,\nوَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ - فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَـهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily, We destroyed them and their nation all together.)27:50-51 `Ali bin Abi Talib said that,\nوَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ\n(And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment (Al-Mihal)), means, His punishment is severe."

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: لَوْ أَنَّ عَبِيدِي أَطَاعُونِي لَأَسْقَيْتُهُمُ الْمَطَرَ بِاللَّيْلِ، وَأَطْلَعْتُ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّمْسَ بِالنَّهَارِ، وَلَمَا أَسْمَعْتُهُمْ صَوْتَ الرَّعْد»\n(Your Lord, the Exalted and Most High, said, `Had My servants obeyed Me, I would have given them rain by night and the sun by day, and would not have made them hear the sound of the Ra`d (thunder).') Allah's statement,\nوَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ\n(He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills,) indicates that He sends thunderbolts as punishment upon whom He wills, and this is why thunderbolts increase as time comes to an end. Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that Arbad bin Qays bin Juzu' bin Julayd bin Ja`far bin Kulab, and `Amir bin At-Tufayl bin Malik came to Al-Madinah to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and sat where he was sitting. `Amir bin At-Tufayl said, \"O Muhammad! What will you give me if I embrace Islam\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَكَ مَا لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَعَلَيْكَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(You will have the rights and duties of all Muslims.) `Amir bin At-Tufayl said, \"Will you make me your successor if I embrace Islam\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لَكَ وَلَا لِقَوْمِكَ، وَلَكِنْ لَكَ أَعِنَّةَ الْخَيْل»\n(That is not your right, nor your people's right. However, I could appoint you a commander of the horsemen (i.e., war).) `Amir said, \"I am already the commander of the horsemen of Najd (in the north of Arabia). Give me control over the desert and you keep the cities.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused. When these two men were leaving the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Amir said, \"By Allah! I will fill it (Al-Madinah) with horses and men (hostile to Muslims).\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,\n«يَمْنَعُكَ الله»\n(Rather, Allah will prevent you. ) When `Amir and Arbad left, `Amir said, \"O Arbad! I will keep Muhammad busy while talking to him, so you can strike him with the sword. Verily, if you kill Muhammad, the people (Muslims) will agree to take blood money and will hate to wage war over his murder. Then we will give them the blood money.\" Arbad said, \"I will do that,\" and they went back to the Messenger ﷺ. `Amir said, \"O Muhammad! Stand next to me so that I can talk to you.\" The Messenger ﷺ stood up, and they both stood next to a wall talking to each other. Arbad wanted to grab his sword, but his hand froze when it touched the sword's handle and he could not take the sword out of its sheath. Arbad did not strike the Messenger ﷺ as `Amir suggested, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at Arbad and realized what he was doing, so he departed. When Arbad and `Amir left the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and arrived at Al-Harrah of Waqim area, they dismounted from their horses. However, Sa`d bin Mu`adh and Usayd bin Hudayr came out saying, \"Come, O enemies of Allah! May Allah curse you.\" `Amir asked, \"Who is this with you, O Sa`d\" Sa`d said, \"This is Usayd bin Hudayr.\" They fled until they reached the Riqm area, where Allah struck Arbad with a bolt of lightning and he met his demise. As for `Amir, he went on until he reached the Kharim area, where Allah sent an open ulcer that struck him. During that night, `Amir took refuge in a woman's house, from Banu Salul. `Amir kept touching his open ulcer and saying, \"An ulcer as big as a camel's hump, while I am at the house of a woman from Bani Salul, seeking to bring my death in her house!\" He rode his horse, but he died while riding it headed to his area. Allah sent down these Ayat (13:8-11) in their case,\nاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى\n(Allah knows what every female bears) until,\nوَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَالٍ\n(..and they will find besides Him no protector.) Ibn `Abbas commented, \"The angels in succession, guard Muhammad ﷺ, by the command of Allah.\" He next mentioned the demise of Arbad by Allah's command, reciting this Ayah,\nوَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَعِقَ\n(He sends the thunderbolts,)\" Allah said next,\nوَهُمْ يُجَـدِلُونَ فِى اللَّهِ\n(yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allah.) they doubt Allah's greatness and that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him,\nوَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ\n(And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment.) Allah's torment is severe against those who rebel against Him, defy Him and persist in disbelief, according to the Tafsir of Ibn Jarir At-Tabari. There is a similar Ayah in the Qur'an,\nوَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ - فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَـهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily, We destroyed them and their nation all together.)27:50-51 `Ali bin Abi Talib said that,\nوَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ\n(And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment (Al-Mihal)), means, His punishment is severe."

Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, and Malik who narrated it from Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, said that,\nلَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ\n(For Him is the Word of Truth.) means, \"La ilaha illallah.\" Allah said next,\nوَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ\n(And those whom they invoke besides Him...), meaning, the example of those who worship others besides Allah,\nكَبَـسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ إِلَى الْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُغَ فَاهُ\n(like one who stretches forth his hand for water to reach his mouth,) `Ali bin Abi Talib commented, \"Like he who stretches his hand on the edge of a deep well to reach the water, even though his hands do not reach it; so how can the water reach his mouth\" Mujahid said about,\nكَبَـسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ\n(like one who stretches forth his hand) \"Calling the water with his words and pointing at it, but it will never come to him this way.\" The meaning of this Ayah is that he who stretches his hand to water from far away, to either collect some or draw some from far away, will not benefit from the water which will not reach his mouth, where water should be consumed. Likewise, those idolators who call another deity besides Allah, will never benefit from these deities in this life or the Hereafter, hence Allah's statement,\nوَمَا دُعَآءُ الْكَـفِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِى ضَلَـلٍ\n(and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but misguidance.)"

      "text": "Affirming Tawhid\nAllah affirms here that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, since they admit that He alone created the heavens and the earth and that He is their Lord and the Disposer of all affairs. Yet, they take as lords others besides Allah and worship them, even though these false gods do not have the power to benefit or harm themselves, or those who worship them. Therefore, the polytheists will not benefit or have harm removed from them by these false deities. Are those who worship the false deities instead of Allah equal to those who worship Him alone, without partners, and thus have a light from their Lord This is why Allah said here,\nقُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الاٌّعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَـتُ وَالنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُواْ للَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ\n(Say: \"Is the blind equal to the one who sees Or darkness equal to light Or do they assign to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creations seemed alike to them\") Allah asks, `Do these polytheists worship gods besides Him that rival Him in what He created Have their false deities created similar creations to those Allah created and, thus, they are confused between the two types of creations, not knowing which was created by others besides Allah' Rather, the Ayah proves that the truth is nothing like this. There is none similar to Allah, nor does He have an equal, a rival, anyone like Him, a minister, a son, or a wife. Allah is glorified in that He is far away from all that is ascribed to Him. These idolators worship gods that they themselves admit were created by Allah and are subservient to Him. They used to say during their Talbiyah: \"Here we rush to Your obedience. There is no partner for You, except Your partner, You own him and he owns not.\" Allah also mentioned their polytheistic statements in other Ayat,\nمَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى\n(We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.) 39:3 Allah admonished them for this false creed, stating that only those whom He chooses are allowed to intercede with Him,\nوَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ\n(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) 34:23\nوَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ\n(And there are many angels in the heavens.....)53:26, and,\nإِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً\n(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) 19:93-95 If all are Allah's servants, then why do any of them worships each other without proof or evidence that allows them to do so Rather, they rely on sheer opinion and innovation in the religion, even though Allah has sent all of His Prophets and Messengers, from beginning to end, prohibiting this practice (polytheism) and ordering them to refrain from worshipping others besides Allah. They defied their Messengers and rebelled against them, and this is why the word of punishment struck them as a worthy recompense, e\nوَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا\n(And your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49"

      "text": "Two Parables proving that Truth remains and Falsehood perishes\nThis honorable Ayah contains two parables which affirm that truth remains and increases, while falsehood diminishes and perishes. Allah said,\nأَنزَلَ مِنَ الْسَّمَآءِ مَآءً\n(He sends down water from the sky,) He sends rain,\nفَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا\n(and the valleys flow according to their measure,) each valley taking its share according to its capacity, for some valleys are wider and can retain more water than others which are small and thus retain smaller measures of water. This Ayah indicates that hearts differ, for some of them can retain substantial knowledge while others cannot entertain knowledge, but rather are bothered by knowledge,\nفَاحْتَمَلَ السَّيْلُ زَبَدًا رَّابِيًا\n(but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface) of the water that ran down the valleys; this is the first parable. Allah said next,\nوَمِمَّا يُوقِدُونَ عَلَيْهِ فِى النَّارِ ابْتِغَآءَ حِلْيَةٍ أَوْ مَتَـعٍ\n(and (also) from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils...) This is the second parable, whereas gold and silver ore is heated with fire to make adornments with it, and iron and copper ore are heated to make pots and the like with it. Foam also rises to the surface of these ores, just as in the case with water,\nكَذَلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْحَقَّ وَالْبَـطِلَ\n(thus does Allah (by parables) show forth truth and falsehood.) when they both exist, falsehood does not remain, just as foam does not remain with the water or the gold and silver ores which are heated in fire. Rather, foam dissipates and vanishes,\nفَأَمَّا الزَّبَدُ فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً\n(Then, as for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks,) for it carries no benefit and dissipates and scatters on the banks of the valley. The foam also sticks to trees or is dissipated by wind, just as the case with the scum that rises on the surface of gold, silver, iron and copper ores; it all goes away and never returns. However, water, gold and silver remain and are used to man's benefit. This is why Allah said next,\nوَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ كَذلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ\n(while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allah sets forth parables.) Allah said in a similar Ayah,\nوَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ\n(And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge.) 29:43 Some of the Salaf (rightly guided ancestors) said, \"When I would read a parable in the Qur'an that I could not comprehend, I would cry for myself because Allah the Exalted says,\nوَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ\n(But none will understand them except those who have knowledge.)\" 29:43 `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nأَنَزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا\n(He sends down water from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure,) \"This is a parable that Allah has set; the hearts carry knowledge from Him, and certainty according to the amount of doubt. As for doubt, working good deeds does not benefit while it exists. As for certainty, Allah benefits its people by it, hence Allah's statement,\nفَأَمَّا الزَّبَدُ\n(Then, as for the foam), which refers to doubt,\nفَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً وَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth.) in reference to certainty. And just as when jewelry is heated in fire and is rid of its impurity, which remains in the fire, similarly Allah accepts certainty and discards doubt.\"\nThe Qur'an and the Sunnah contain Parables that use Water and Fire\nAllah has set two examples in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah (chapter 2) about the hypocrites, one using fire and another using water. Allah said,\nمَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى اسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً فَلَمَّآ أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ\n(Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it illuminated all around him.) 2:17 then He said,\nأَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَـتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ\n(Or like a rainstorm in the sky, bringing darkness, thunder, and lightning.) 2:19 Allah also has set two parables for the disbelievers in Surat An-Nur (chapter 24), one of them is,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ\n(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert.)24:39 The mirage occurs during intense heat. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«فَيُقَالُ لِلْيَهُودِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: فَمَا تُرِيدُون؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَيْ رَبَّنَا عَطِشْنَا فَاسْقِنَا. فَيُقَالُ: أَلَا تَرِدُونَ؟ فَيَرِدُونَ النَّارَ فَإِذَا هِيَ كَسَرَابٍ يَحْطِمُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا»\n(It will be said to the Jews on the Day of Resurrection, \"What do you desire\" They will reply, \"We need to drink, for we have become thirsty, O our Lord!\" It will be said, \"Will you then proceed to drink,\" and they will head towards the Fire, which will appear as a mirage, its various parts consuming the other parts.\") Allah said in the second parable (in Surat An-Nur);\nأَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ\n(Or is like the darkness in a vast deep sea.)24:40 In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ مَثَلَ مَا بَعَثَنِي اللهُ بِهِ مِنَ الْهُدَى وَالْعِلْمِ، كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَصَابَ أَرْضًا، فَكَانَ مِنْهَا طَائِفَةٌ قَبِلَتِ الْمَاءَ فَأَنْبَتَتِ الْكَلَأَ وَالْعُشْبَ الْكَثِيرَ، وَكَانَتْ مِنْهَا أَجَادِبُ أَمْسَكَتِ الْمَاءَ، فَنَفَعَ اللهُ بِهَا النَّاسَ، فَشَرِبُوا، وَرَعَوْا، وَسَقُوا، وَزَرَعُوا، وَأَصَابَتْ طَائِفَةً مِنْهَا أُخْرَى، إِنَّمَااِهيَ قِيعَانٌ لَا تُمْسِكُ مَاءً وَلَا تُنْبِتُ كَلَأً، فَذَلِكَ مَثَلُ مَنْ فَقُهَ فِي دِينِ اللهِ وَنَفَعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا بَعَثَنِي وَنَفَعَ بِهِ، فَعَلِمَ وَعَلَّمَ، وَمَثَلُ مَنْ لَمْ يَرْفَعْ بِذَلِكَ رَأْسًا وَلَمْ يَقْبَلْ هُدَى اللهِ الَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِه»\n(The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed the rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. And another portion of it was hard, it held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, grazing, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation purposes. And another portion of it fell on barren land, which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation. The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit, as well as benefiting others (from the knowledge and guidance) which Allah has revealed through me and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not embrace Allah's guidance revealed through me.) This parable uses water in it. In another Hadith that Imam Ahmad collected, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said,\n«مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ، جَعَلَ الْفَرَاشُ وَهَذِهِ الدَّوَابُّ الَّتِي يَقَعْنَ فِي النَّارِ يَقَعْنَ فِيهَا، وَجَعَلَ يَحْجُزُهُنَّ وَيغْلِبْنَهُ فَيَقْتَحِمْنَ فِيهَا قَالَ : فَذَلِكُمْ مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ، أَنَا آخِذٌ بِحُجَزِكُمْ عَنِ النَّارِ، هَلُمَّ عَنِ النَّارِ، فَتَغْلِبُونِي، فَتَقْتَحِمُونَ فِيهَا»\n(My example and the example of you is like that of a person who lit a fire. When the fire illuminated his surroundings, butterflies and insects started falling into it, as they usually do, and he started swatting at them to prevent them from falling; but they overwhelmed him and kept falling into the fire. This is the parable of me and you, I am holding you by the waist trying to save you from the Fire, saying, \"Go away from the Fire,\" yet you overwhelm me and fall into it.) The Two Sahihs also collected this Hadith. This is a parable using fire."

Allah said in another Ayah,\nلاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ\n(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) 59:20 Allah said in this honorable Ayah,\nأَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى\n(Shall he then who knows that what has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind) They are not equal. Allah said next,\nإِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ\n(But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.) meaning, it is those who have sound minds who draw lessons, gain wisdom and understand. We ask Allah to make us among them."

      "text": "Clarifying Allah's Perfect Ability\nAllah mentions His perfect ability and infinite authority, since it is He Who has raised the heavens without pillars by His permission and order. He, by His leave, order and power, has elevated the heavens high above the earth, distant and far away from reach. The heaven nearest to the present world encompasses the earth from all directions, and is also high above it from every direction. The distance between the first heaven and the earth is five hundred years from every direction, and its thickness is also five hundred years. The second heaven surrounds the first heaven from every direction, encompassing everything that the latter carries, with a thickness also of five hundred years and a distance between them of five hundred years. The same is also true about the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh heavens. Allah said,\nاللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ\n(It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof.) 65:12 Allah said next,\nبِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا\n(..without any pillars that you can see.) meaning, `there are pillars, but you cannot see them,' according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and several other scholars. Iyas bin Mu`awiyah said, \"The heaven is like a dome over the earth,\" meaning, without pillars. Similar was reported from Qatadah, and this meaning is better for this part of the Ayah, especially since Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ\n(He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His permission. )22:65 Therefore, Allah's statement,\nتَرَوْنَهَا\n(..that you can see), affirms that there are no pillars. Rather, the heaven is elevated (above the earth) without pillars, as you see. This meaning best affirms Allah's ability and power.\nAl-Istawa', Rising above the Throne\nAllah said next,\nثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ\n(Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne.) We explained the meaning of the Istawa' in Surat Al-A`raf (7:54), and stated that it should be accepted as it is without altering, equating, annulling its meaning, or attempts to explain its true nature. Allah is glorified and praised from all that they attribute to Him.\nAllah subjected the Sun and the Moon to rotate continuously\nAllah said,\nوَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّـى\n(He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running (its course) for a term appointed.) It was said that the sun and the moon continue their course until they cease doing so upon the commencement of the Final Hour, as Allah stated,\nوَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا\n(And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed).)36:38 It was also said that the meaning is: until they settle under the Throne of Allah after passing the other side of the earth. So when they, and the rest of the planetary bodies reach there, they are at the furthest distance from the Throne. Because according to the correct view, which the texts prove, it is shaped like a domb, under which is all of the creation. It is not circular like the celestial bodies, because it has pillars by which it is carried. This fact is clear to those who correctly understand the Ayat and authentic Hadiths. All the (praise is due to) Allah and all the favors are from Him. Allah mentioned the sun and the moon here because they are among the brightest seven heavenly objects. Therefore, if Allah subjected these to His power, then it is clear that He has also subjected all other heavenly objects. Allah said in other Ayat,\nلاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ\n(Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.) 41:37 and,\nوَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54 Allah's statement next,\nيُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ\n(He explains the Ayat in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the Meeting with your Lord.) means, He explains the signs and clear evidences that testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. These evidences prove that He will resurrect creation if He wills, just as He started it."

Allah said next,\nوَالَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ\n(And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined) they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship. They are also kind to the poor and the needy and generous in nature,\nوَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ\n(and fear their Lord), in what they do or do not do of actions and statements. They remember that Allah is watching during all of this and are afraid of His terrifying reckoning in the Hereafter. Therefore, all their affairs are on the straight path and correct, whether they are active or idle, and in all of their affairs, including those that affect others,\nوَالَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِمْ\n(And those who remain patient, seeking their Lord's Face,) They observe patience while staying away from sins and evil deeds, doing so while dedicating themselves to the service of their Lord the Exalted and Most Honored and seeking His pleasure and generous reward,\nوَأَقَامُواْ الصَّلَوةَ\n(and perform the Salah), preserving its limits, times, bowing, prostration and humbleness, according to the established limits and rulings of the religion,\nوَأَنْفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ\n(and spend out of that which We have bestowed on them,) They spend on those whom they are obliged to spend on them, such as their spouses, relatives and the poor and needy in general,\nسِرًّا وَعَلاَنِيَةً\n(secretly and openly,) They spend during all conditions and times, whether during the night or the day, secretly and openly,\nوَيَدْرَءُونَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ السَّيِّئَةَ\n(and repel evil with good) they resist evil with good conduct. When the people harm them they face their harm with good patience, forbearing, forgiveness and pardon. Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ - وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ\n(Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient - and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion in this world.)41:34-35 This is why Allah states here that those who have these good qualities, the blessed ones, will earn the final home, which He explained next,\nجَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ\n(`Adn Gardens), where, `Adn, indicates continuous residence; they will reside in the gardens of everlasting life. Allah said next,\nوَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ ءَابَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ\n(and (also) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring.) Allah will gather them with their loved ones, from among their fathers, family members and offspring, those who are righteous and deserve to enter Paradise, so that their eyes are comforted by seeing them. He will also elevate the grade of those who are lower, to the grades of those who are higher, a favor from Him out of His kindness, without decreasing the grade of those who are higher up (in Paradise). Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith: to them shall We join their offspring.) 52:21 Allah said next,\nجَنَّـتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ ءَابَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ وَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ - سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُم بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ\n(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience!

The angels will welcome them with the Islamic greeting and commend them for earning Allah's closeness and rewards, as well as, being admitted into the Dwelling of Peace, neighbors to the honorable Messengers, the Prophets and the truthful believers. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As, may Allah be pleased with them both, narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللهِ؟»\n(Do you know who among Allah's creation will enter Paradise first) They said, \"Allah and His Messenger have more knowledge.\" He said,\n«أَوَّلُ مَنْ يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللهِ الْفُقَرَاءُ الْمُهَاجِرُونَ الَّذِينَ تُسَدُّ بِهِمُ الثُّغُورُ، وَتُتَّقَى بِهِمُ الْمَكَارِهُ، وَيَمُوتُ أَحَدُهُمْ وَحَاجَتُهُ فِي صَدْرِهِ، لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ لَهَا قَضَاءً، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ مَلَائِكَتِهِ: ائْتُوهُمْ فَحَيُّوهُمْ، فَتَقُولُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: نَحْنُ سُكَّانُ سَمَائِكَ، وَخِيرَتُكَ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ، أَفَتَأْمُرُنَا أَنْ نَأْتِي هؤُلَاءِ وَنُسَلِّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ؟ فَيَقُولُ: إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا عِبَادًا يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئًا، وَتُسَدُّ بِهِمُ الثُّغُورُ، وَتُتَّقَى بِهِمُ الْمَكَارِهُ، وَيَمُوتُ أَحَدُهُمْ وَحَاجَتُهُ فِي صَدْرِهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ لَهَا قَضَاءً قَالَ : فَتَأْتِيهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ فَيَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ كُلِّ بَاب»\n(The first among Allah's creation to enter Paradise are the poor emigrants (in Allah's cause) with whom the outposts (of the land) are secured and the various afflictions are warded off.

The Hereafter is (far) better for him who has Taqwa, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to the amount of a Fatila.)4:77 and,\nبَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - وَالاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى\n(Nay, you prefer the life of this world, although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.)87:16-17 Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Mustawrid, from Bani Fihr, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَا الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا كَمَا يَجْعَلُ أَحَدُكُمْ إصْبَعَهُ هَذِهِ فِي الْيَمِّ، فَلْيَنْظُرْ بِمَ تَرْجِع»\n(The life of the present world, compared to the Hereafter, is just like when one of you inserts his finger in the sea, so let him contemplate how much of it will it carry.) and he pointed with the index finger. Imam Muslim also collected this Hadith in his Sahih. In another Hadith, the Prophet passed by a dead sheep, whose ears were small, and said,\n«وَاللهِ لَلدُّنْيَا أَهْوَنُ عَلَى اللهِ مِنْ هَذَا عَلَى أَهْلِهِ حِينَ أَلْقَوه»\n(By Allah! The life of this present world is as insignificant to Allah as this sheep was to its owners when they threw it away.)\nوَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ - الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ - الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ طُوبَى لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَـَابٍ"

There is a Hadith which mentions that the idolators asked the Prophet to turn Mount As-Safa into gold and, they also asked him for a spring to gush forth for them and to remove the mountains from around Makkah and replace them with green fields and gardens. Allah revealed to His Messenger : \"If You wish, O Muhammad, I will give them what they asked for. However, if they disbelieve thereafter, I will punish them with a punishment that I did not punish any among the `Alamin (mankind and the Jinns). Or, if you wish, I will open for them the door to repentance and mercy.\" The Prophet said,\n«بَلْ تَفْتَحُ لَهُمْ بَابَ التَّوبَةِ وَالرَّحْمَة»\n(Rather, open for them the door to repentance and mercy.) This is why Allah said to His Messenger next,\nقُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ\n(Say: \"Verily, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance.\") Allah states that He brings misguidance or guidance whether the Messenger ﷺ was given a sign (a miracle) according to their asking or not. Verily, earning the misguidance or the guidance are not connected to the miracles or the lack of them. Allah said in other Ayat, f\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.) 10:101\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ\n(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.)10:96-97, and,\nوَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ قُبُلاً مَّا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ\n(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allah willed, but most of them behave ignorantly.) 6:111 Allah said here,\nقُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ\n(Say: \"Verily, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance.\") meaning, He guides to Him those who repent, turn to Him, beg Him, seek His help and humbly submit to Him.\nThe Believer's Heart finds Comfort in the Remembrance of Allah\nAllah said,\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ\n(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah.) for their hearts find comfort on the side of Allah, become tranquil when He is remembered and pleased to have Him as their Protector and Supporter. So Allah said,\nأَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ\n(Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) and surely, He is worthy of it.\nThe Meaning of Tuba\nAllah said,\nالَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ طُوبَى لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَـَابٍ\n(Those who believed, and work righteousness, Tuba is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Tuba means, \"Happiness and comfort or refreshment of the eye.\" `Ikrimah said that Tuba means, \"How excellent is what they earned,\" while Ad-Dahhak said, \"A joy for them.\" Furthermore, Ibrahim An-Nakh`i said that Tuba means, \"Better for them,\" while Qatadah said that it is an Arabic word that means, `you have earned a good thing.' In another narration, Qatadah said that `Tuba for them' means, \"It is excellent for them,\"\nوَحُسْنُ مَـَابٍ\n(and a beautiful place of return.) and final destination. These meanings for Tuba are all synonymous and they do not contradict one another. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri said that a man asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Tuba for those who saw you and believed in you!\" The Prophet said,\n«طُوبَى لِمَنْ رَآنِي وَآمَنَ بِي، وَطُوبَى ثُمَّ طُوبَى ثُمَّ طُوبَى لِمَنْ آمَنَ بِي وَلَمْ يَرَنِي»\n(Tuba is for he who saw me and believed in me. Tuba, and another Tuba, and another Tuba for he who believed in me, but did not see me.) A man asked, \"What is Tuba\" The Prophet said,\n«شَجَرَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ مَسِيرَتُهَا مِائَةُ عَامٍ ثِيَابُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَكْمَامِهَا»\n(A tree in Paradise whose width is a hundred years, and the clothes of the people of Paradise are taken from its bark.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا»\n(There is a tree in Paradise, if a rider travels in its shade for one hundred years, he would not be able to cross it.) An-Nu`man bin Abi `Ayyash Az-Zuraqi added, \"Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated to me that the Prophet said,\n«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ الْجَوَادَ الْمُضَمَّرَ السَّرِيعَ مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا»\n(There is a tree in Paradise, if a rider travels in its shade on a fast, sleek horse for one hundred years, he would not be able to cross it.)\" In his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,\n«يَا عِبَادِي لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ قَامُوا فِي صَعِيدٍ وَاحِدٍ فَسَأَلُونِي فَأَعْطَيْتُ كُلَّ إِنْسَانٍ مَسْأَلَتَهُ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا إِلَّا كَمَا يَنْقُصُ الْمِخْيَطُ إِذَا أُدْخِلَ فِي الْبَحْر»\n(O My slaves! If the first and the last among you, mankind and Jinns among you, stood in one spot and asked Me and I gave each person what he asked, it will not decrease from My dominion, except what the needle decreases (or carries) when entered into the sea.) Khalid bin Ma`ddan said, \"There is a tree in Paradise called Tuba, that has breasts that nurse the children of the people of Paradise. Verily, the miscarriage of a woman will be swimming in one of the rivers of Paradise until the Day of Resurrection commences, when he will be gathered with people while forty years of age.\" Ibn Abi Hatim collected this statement.\nكَذَلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِى أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَآ أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَ عَلَيْهِمُ الَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّى لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ"

An-Nu`man bin Abi `Ayyash Az-Zuraqi added, \"Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated to me that the Prophet said,\n«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ الْجَوَادَ الْمُضَمَّرَ السَّرِيعَ مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا»\n(There is a tree in Paradise, if a rider travels in its shade on a fast, sleek horse for one hundred years, he would not be able to cross it.)\" In his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,\n«يَا عِبَادِي لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ قَامُوا فِي صَعِيدٍ وَاحِدٍ فَسَأَلُونِي فَأَعْطَيْتُ كُلَّ إِنْسَانٍ مَسْأَلَتَهُ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا إِلَّا كَمَا يَنْقُصُ الْمِخْيَطُ إِذَا أُدْخِلَ فِي الْبَحْر»\n(O My slaves! If the first and the last among you, mankind and Jinns among you, stood in one spot and asked Me and I gave each person what he asked, it will not decrease from My dominion, except what the needle decreases (or carries) when entered into the sea.) Khalid bin Ma`ddan said, \"There is a tree in Paradise called Tuba, that has breasts that nurse the children of the people of Paradise. Verily, the miscarriage of a woman will be swimming in one of the rivers of Paradise until the Day of Resurrection commences, when he will be gathered with people while forty years of age.\" Ibn Abi Hatim collected this statement.\nكَذَلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِى أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَآ أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَ عَلَيْهِمُ الَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّى لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ"

      "text": "Allah's Signs on the Earth\nAfter Allah mentioned the higher worlds, He started asserting His power, wisdom and control over the lower parts of the world. Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى مَدَّ الاٌّرْضَ\n(And it is He Who spread out the earth) made it spacious in length and width. Allah has placed on the earth firm mountains and made rivers, springs and water streams run through it, so that the various kinds of fruits and plants of every color, shape, taste and scent are watered with this water,\nمِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ\n(and of every kind of fruit He made Zawjayn Ithnayn.), two types from every kind of fruit,\nيُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ\n(He brings the night as a cover over the day.) Allah made the day and night pursue each other, when one is about to depart, the other overcomes it, and vice versa. Allah controls time just as He controls space and matter,\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ\n(Verily, in these things, there are Ayat for people who reflect.) who reflect on Allah's signs and the evidences of His wisdom. Allah said,\nوَفِى الاٌّرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَـوِرَتٌ\n(And in the earth are neighboring tracts, ) Meaning, next to each other, some of them are fertile and produce what benefits people, while others are dead, salty and do not produce anything. This meaning was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and several others. This also covers the various colors and types of diverse areas on the earth; some red, some white, or yellow, or black, some are stony, or flat, or sandy, or thick, or thin, all made to neighbor each other while preserving their own qualities. All this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills, there is no deity or lord except Him. Allah said next,\nوَجَنَّـتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ\n(and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date palms...) Allah's statement, next,\nصِنْوَنٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَنٍ\n(Sinwanun wa (or) Ghayru Sinwan.) `Sinwan' means, growing into two or three from a single stem, such as figs, pomegranate and dates. `Ghayru Sinwan' means, having one stem for every tree, as is the case with most plants. From this meaning, the paternal uncle is called one's `Sinw' of his father. There is an authentic Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab,\n«أَمَا شَعَرْتَ أَنَّ عَمَّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيه»\n(Do you not know that man's paternal uncle is the Sinw of his father) Allah said next,\nوَحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ\n(watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.) Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet commented on Allah's statement,\nوَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ\n(yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.)\n«الدَّقَلُ، وَالْفَارِسِيُّ، وَالْحُلْوُ، وَالْحَامِض»\n(The Dagal, the Persian, the sweet, the bitter...\") At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Therefore, there are differences between plants and fruits with regards to shape, color, taste, scent, blossoms and the shape of their leaves. There are plants that are very sweet or sour, bitter or mild, fresh; some plants have a combination of these attributes, and the taste then changes and becomes another taste, by Allah's will. There is also some that are yellow in color, or red, or white, or black, or blue, and the same can be said about their flowers; and all these variances and complex diversities are watered by the same water. Surely, in this there are signs for those who have sound reasoning, and surely, all this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills and Whose power made distinctions between various things and created them as He wills. So Allah said,\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(Verily, in these things there are Ayat for the people who understand.)\nوَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدونَ"

Likewise, We sent others to earlier nations that disbelieved in Allah. The Messengers whom We sent before you, were also denied and rejected, so you have an example in what they faced. And since We sent Our torment and revenge on those people, then let these people fear what will strike them, for their denial of you is harsher than the denial that the previous Messengers faced,'\nتَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَى أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ\n(By Allah, We indeed sent (Messengers) to the nations before you.)16-63 Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُواْ عَلَى مَا كُذِّبُواْ وَأُوذُواْ حَتَّى أَتَـهُمْ نَصْرُنَا وَلاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَـتِ اللَّهِ وَلَقدْ جَآءَكَ مِن نَّبَإِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(Verily, many Messengers were denied before you, with patience they bore the denial and suffering until; till Our help reached them, and none can alter the Words (decree) of Allah. Surely, there has reached you the information (news) about the Messengers (before you).)6-34, meaning, `How We gave them victory and granted the best end for them and their followers in this life and the Hereafter. ' Allah said next,\nوَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ\n(while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allah).) Allah says, `These people, that We sent you to, disbelieve in the Most Gracious and deny Him, because they dislike describing Allah by Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim the Most Gracious, Most Merciful.' This is why on the day of Al-Hudaybiyyah, as Al-Bukhari narrated, they refused to write, \"In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim,\" saying, \"We do not know Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim!\" Qatadah narrated this words. Allah the Exalted said,\nقُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءَ الْحُسْنَى\n(Say: \"Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him, for to Him belong the Best Names.) 17:110 In his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ أَحَبَّ الْأَسْمَاءِ إِلَى اللهِ تَعَالَى عَبْدُاللهِ وَعَبْدُ الرَّحْمَن»\n(The most beloved names to Allah the Exalted are: `Abdullah and `Abdur-Rahman.)Allah said next,\nقُلْ هُوَ رَبِّى لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(Say: \"He is my Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but He!\") meaning: for I believe in Allah in Whom you disbelieve and affirm His Divinity and Lordship. He is my Lord, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him,\nعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ\n(In Him is my trust,) in all of my affairs,\nوَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ\n(and to Him I turn.) meaning: to Him I return and repent, for He alone is worthy of all this and none else besides Him.\nوَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الاٌّرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَى بَل للَّهِ الاٌّمْرُ جَمِيعًا أَفَلَمْ يَاْيْـَسِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ يَزَالُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ وَعْدُ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ"

      "text": "Virtues of the Qur'an and the Denial of Disbelievers\nAllah praises the Qur'an which He has revealed to Muhammad ﷺ and prefers it to all other divinely revealed Books before it,\nوَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ\n(And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved,) Allah says, `If there were a Book among the previous Divine Books with which the mountains could be moved from their places, or the earth could be cleaved asunder, or the dead speak in their graves, it would have been this Qur'an and none else.' Or, this Qur'an is more worthy to cause all this, because of its marvelous eloquence that defies the ability of mankind and the Jinns, even if all of them gather their forces together to invent something like it or even a Surah like it. Yet, these idolators disbelieve in the Qur'an and reject it. Allah said,\nبَل للَّهِ الاٌّمْرُ جَمِيعًا\n(But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah.) The decision over all affairs is with Allah Alone, whatever He wills, occurs and whatever He does not will, never occurs. Certainly, he whom Allah misguides, will never find enlightenment and he whom Allah guides, will never be misled. We should state here that it is possible to call other Divine Books, `Qur'an', since this Qur'an is based on all of them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«خُفِّفَتْ عَلَى دَاوُدَ الْقِرَاءَةُ فَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ بِدَابَّتِهِ أَنْ تُسْرَجَ، فَكَانَ يَقْرَأُ الْقُرْآنَ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تُسْرَجَ دَابَّتُهُ، وَكَانَ لَا يَأْكُلُ إِلَّا مِنْ عَمَلِ يَدَيْه»\n(Reciting was made easy for (Prophet) Dawud (David) in that he used to order that his animal be prepared for him to ride and in the meantime he would read the entire Qur'an. He used to eat only from what his hand made.) Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith. The Qur'an mentioned here is refers to the Zabur. Allah said next,\nأَفَلَمْ يَاْيْـَسِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ\n(Have not then those who believed yet known) that not all people would believe and understand and that,\nأَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا\n(had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind) Surely, there is not a miracle or evidence more eloquent or effective on the heart and mind than this Qur'an. Had Allah revealed it to a mountain, you would see the mountain shake and humbled from fear of Allah. The Sahih recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Every Prophet was given (a miracle) the type of which would make (some) people believe. What I was given, however, is a revelation from Allah to me, and I hope that I will have the most following among them (Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) This Hadith indicates that every Prophet's miracle disappeared upon his death, but this Qur'an will remain as evidence for all times. Verily, the miracle of the Qur'an will never end, nor will it become old the more it is read, nor will scholars ever have enough of it. The Qur'an is serious and is not meant for jest; any tyrant that abandons it, Allah will destroy him; he who seeks guidance in other than the Qur'an, then Allah will misguide him. Allah said next,\nبَل للَّهِ الاٌّمْرُ جَمِيعًا\n(But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah.) Ibn `Abbas commented, \"He will only do what He wills and He decided that He will not do that.\" Ibn Ishaq reported a chain for this, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari agreed with it. Allah said next,\nوَلاَ يَزَالُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ\n(And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it settles close to their homes,) because of their denial, disasters will still strike them in this life or strike those all around them, as a lesson and example for them. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرَى وَصَرَّفْنَا الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ\n(And indeed We have destroyed towns round about you, and We have shown (them) the Ayat in various ways that they might return (to the truth).)46-27, and,\nأَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِى الاٌّرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَآ أَفَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders Is it then they who will overcome) 21:44 Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan commented on Allah's statement,\nأَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ\n(or it settles close to their homes,) \"It is in reference to the disaster.\" This is the apparent meaning here. Al-`Awfi reported that bin `Abbas said about,\nتُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ\n(And a Qari`ah (disaster) strikes them because of their (evil) deeds) \"A torment that descends on them from heaven,\nأَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ\n(or it settles close to their homes,) when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ camps near their area and fights them.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah. `Ikrimah said in another narration he reported from Ibn `Abbas that,\nقَارِعَةٌ\n(Qari'ah) means affliction. These scholars also said that,\nحَتَّى يَأْتِىَ وَعْدُ اللَّهِ\n(until the promise of Allah comes to pass.) refers to the conquering of Makkah. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it refers to the Day of Resurrection. Allah said next,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ\n(Certainly, Allah breaks not His promise.) to His Messengers to aid them and their followers in this life and the Hereafter,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.)14:47\nوَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَمْلَيْتُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ"

Allah said next,\nوَصُدُّواْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ\n(and they have been hindered from the right path;) Some read with Fatha over the Sad (i.e. wa Saddu), which would mean, `and they hindered from the right path, feeling fond of the misguidance they are in, thinking that it is correct, they called to it and thus hindered the people from following the path of the Messengers.' Others read it with Damma over the Sad (i.e. wa Suddu), which would mean, `and they have been hindered from the right path,' explained it this way: because they thought that their way looked fair or correct, they were hindered by it from the right path, so Allah said,\nوَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ\n(and whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide.) Allah said in similar instances,\nوَمَن يُرِدِ اللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً\n(And whomsoever Allah wants to suffer a trial, you can do nothing for him against Allah.) 5:41, and,\nإِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَى هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(If you covet for their guidance, then verily, Allah guides not those whom He makes to go astray. And they will have no helpers.)16:37"

Indeed, and just as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stated, the torment of this life ends but the torment of the Hereafter is everlasting in a Fire that is seventy times hot than our fire, where there are chains whose thickness and hardness are unimaginable. Allah said in other Ayat,\nفَيَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ يُعَذِّبُ عَذَابَهُ أَحَدٌ - وَلاَ يُوثِقُ وَثَاقَهُ أَحَدٌ\n(So on that Day none will punish as He will punish. And none will bind as He will bind.)89:25-26, and,\nبَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالسَّاعَةِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِالسَّاعَةِ سَعِيراً - إِذَا رَأَتْهُمْ مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُواْ لَهَا تَغَيُّظاً وَزَفِيراً - وَإَذَآ أُلْقُواْ مِنْهَا مَكَاناً ضَيِّقاً مُّقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْاْ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُوراً - لاَّ تَدْعُواْ الْيَوْمَ ثُبُوراً وَحِداً وَادْعُواْ ثُبُوراً كَثِيراً - قُلْ أَذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ أَمْ جَنَّةُ الْخُلْدِ الَّتِى وَعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَزَآءً وَمَصِيراً\n(And for those who deny the Hour, We have prepared a flaming Fire. When it (Hell) sees them from a far place, they will hear its raging and its roaring. And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they will exclaim therein for destruction. Exclaim not today for one destruction, but exclaim for many destructions. Say: \"Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity promised for those who have Taqwa\" It will be theirs as a reward and as a final destination.) 25:11-15 Similarly He said;\nمَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ\n(The description of the Paradise which those who have Taqwa have been promised) meaning its description and qualities;\nتَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ\n(Underneath it rivers flow,) these rivers flow in the various parts and grades of Paradise and wherever its people wish they flow and gush forth for them. Allah also said,\nمَّثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ فِيهَآ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ ءَاسِنٍ وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُ وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ خَمْرٍ لَّذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ وَأَنْهَـرٌ مِّنْ عَسَلٍ مُّصَفًّى وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ\n(The description of Paradise which those who have Taqwa have been promised (is that) in it are rivers of water the taste and smell of which are not changed, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey, therein for them is every kind of fruit, and forgiveness.) 47:15 Allah said next,\nأُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وِظِلُّهَا\n(its provision is eternal and so is its shade) for Paradise has foods, fruits and drinks that never end or finish. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Abbas narrated in the Hadith about the Eclipse prayer that the Companions said, \"O Allah's Messenger! While you were standing in prayer, we saw you reach for something with your hand and then you brought it back.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,\n«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ أَوْ أُرِيتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»\n(I saw Paradise - or was shown Paradise - and reached for a cluster (of grapes or other fruit), and had I kept it, you would have eaten from it as long as this life remains.) iImam Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يَأْكُلُ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ وَيَشْرَبُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَبُولُونَ، طَعَامُهُمْ جُشَاءٌ كَرِيحِ الْمِسْكِ، وَيُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّقْدِيسَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»\n(The people of Paradise eat and drink, and they do not need to blow their noses, or answer the call of nature, or urinate, for they pass the food excrements in belches, which smell like musk. They will be inspired to praise and glorify (Allah) as spontaneously as they breathe.) Imams Ahmad and An-Nasa'i recorded that Thumamah bin `Uqbah said that he heard Zayd bin Arqam say, \"A man from the People of the Scriptures came and said to the Prophet , `O Abul-Qasim! You claim that the people of Paradise eat and drink' The Prophet ﷺ said,\n«نَعَمْ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ مِنْهُمْ لَيُعطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَةِ رَجُلٍ فِي الْأَكْلِ وَالشُّرْبِ وَالْجِمَاعِ وَالشَّهْوَة»\n(Yes. By He in Whose Hand is Muhammad's life, a man among them will be given the strength of a hundred men in eating, drinking, sexual intercourse and appetite.) That man asked, `He who eats and drinks needs to relieve the call of nature, but Paradise is pure from feces and urine' The Prophet said,\n«تَكُونُ حَاجَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ رَشْحًا يَفِيضُ مِنْ جُلُودِهِمْ كَرِيحِ الْمِسْكِ فَيَضْمُرُ بَطْنُه»\n(One of them (residents of Paradise) relieves the call of nature through a sweat that emanates from the skin, with the scent of musk, and the stomach becomes empty again.) Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ\n(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.)56:32-33, and,\nوَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَـلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً\n(And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)76:14 The shade of Paradise is everlasting and never shrinks, just as Allah said,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً\n(But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Therein they shall have pure mates, and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening.)4:57 Allah often mentions the description of Paradise and the description of the Fire together, to make Paradise appealing and warn against the Fire. This is why, after Allah mentioned the description of Paradise here, He next said,\nتِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّعُقْبَى الْكَـفِرِينَ النَّارُ\n(this is the end (final destination) of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.) Allah said in another Ayah ,\nلاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ\n(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) 59:20"

Allah said in similar Ayat,\nوَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ\n(And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah.) 3:199 Allah said next,\nقُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ وَلا أُشْرِكَ بِهِ\n(Say: \"I am commanded only to worship Allah and not to join partners with Him...\") meaning, `I (Muhammad) was sent with the religion of worshipping Allah alone without partners, just as the Messengers before me,\nإِلَيْهِ أَدْعُو\n(To Him (alone) I call), I call the people to His path,\nوَإِلَيْهِ مَآبِ\n(and to Him is my return.) final destination and destiny.' Allah said,\nوَكَذلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ حُكْمًا عَرَبِيًّا\n(And thus have We sent it (the Qur'an) down to be a judgement of authority in Arabic.) Allah says, `Just as We sent Messengers before you and revealed to them Divine Books from heaven, We sent down to you the Qur'an, a judgement of authority in Arabic, as an honor for you, and We preferred you among all people with this clear, plain and unequivocal Book that,\nلاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ\n(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.)' 41:42 Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم\n(Were you to follow their (vain) desires), means, their opinions,\nبَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ\n(after the knowledge which has come to you) from Allah, all praise to Him,\nمَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلاَ وَاقٍ\n(then you will not have any Wali (protector) or defender against Allah.) This part of the Ayah warns people of know- ledge against following the paths of misguid- ance after they had gained knowledge in (and abided by) the Prophetic Sunnah and the path of Muhammad ﷺ, may Allah's best peace and blessings be on him."

There is also a Hadith recorded in the Sahih that affirms that maintaining the ties of the womb increases the life span. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,\nيَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ\n(Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills).

      "text": "Allah's Signs on the Earth\nAfter Allah mentioned the higher worlds, He started asserting His power, wisdom and control over the lower parts of the world. Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى مَدَّ الاٌّرْضَ\n(And it is He Who spread out the earth) made it spacious in length and width. Allah has placed on the earth firm mountains and made rivers, springs and water streams run through it, so that the various kinds of fruits and plants of every color, shape, taste and scent are watered with this water,\nمِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ\n(and of every kind of fruit He made Zawjayn Ithnayn.), two types from every kind of fruit,\nيُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ\n(He brings the night as a cover over the day.) Allah made the day and night pursue each other, when one is about to depart, the other overcomes it, and vice versa. Allah controls time just as He controls space and matter,\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ\n(Verily, in these things, there are Ayat for people who reflect.) who reflect on Allah's signs and the evidences of His wisdom. Allah said,\nوَفِى الاٌّرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَـوِرَتٌ\n(And in the earth are neighboring tracts, ) Meaning, next to each other, some of them are fertile and produce what benefits people, while others are dead, salty and do not produce anything. This meaning was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and several others. This also covers the various colors and types of diverse areas on the earth; some red, some white, or yellow, or black, some are stony, or flat, or sandy, or thick, or thin, all made to neighbor each other while preserving their own qualities. All this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills, there is no deity or lord except Him. Allah said next,\nوَجَنَّـتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ\n(and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date palms...) Allah's statement, next,\nصِنْوَنٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَنٍ\n(Sinwanun wa (or) Ghayru Sinwan.) `Sinwan' means, growing into two or three from a single stem, such as figs, pomegranate and dates. `Ghayru Sinwan' means, having one stem for every tree, as is the case with most plants. From this meaning, the paternal uncle is called one's `Sinw' of his father. There is an authentic Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab,\n«أَمَا شَعَرْتَ أَنَّ عَمَّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيه»\n(Do you not know that man's paternal uncle is the Sinw of his father) Allah said next,\nوَحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ\n(watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.) Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet commented on Allah's statement,\nوَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ\n(yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.)\n«الدَّقَلُ، وَالْفَارِسِيُّ، وَالْحُلْوُ، وَالْحَامِض»\n(The Dagal, the Persian, the sweet, the bitter...\") At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Therefore, there are differences between plants and fruits with regards to shape, color, taste, scent, blossoms and the shape of their leaves. There are plants that are very sweet or sour, bitter or mild, fresh; some plants have a combination of these attributes, and the taste then changes and becomes another taste, by Allah's will. There is also some that are yellow in color, or red, or white, or black, or blue, and the same can be said about their flowers; and all these variances and complex diversities are watered by the same water. Surely, in this there are signs for those who have sound reasoning, and surely, all this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills and Whose power made distinctions between various things and created them as He wills. So Allah said,\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(Verily, in these things there are Ayat for the people who understand.)\nوَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدونَ"

Allah said,\nوَمَنْ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ الْكِتَـبِ\n(and those too who have knowledge of the Scripture.) This refers to `Abdullah bin Salam, according to Mujahid. However, this opinion is not plausible, since this Ayah was revealed in Makkah and `Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam soon after the Prophet emigrated to Al-Madinah. A more suitable explanation is that narrated by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas that this Ayah refers to Jews and Christians. Qatadah said that among them are, `Abdullah bin Salam, Salman (Al-Farisi) and Tamim Ad-Dari. The correct view is that this Ayah,\nوَمَنْ عِندَهُ\n(and those too who have. ..), refers to the scholars of the People of the Scriptures who find the description of Muhammad in their Books and the good news of his advent that were conveyed to them by their Prophets. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَرَحْمَتِى وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَسَأَكْتُبُهَا لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَـوةَ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِـَايَـتِنَا يُؤْمِنُونَالَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِىَّ الأُمِّىَّ الَّذِى يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِى التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ\n(And My mercy embraces all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who have Taqwa, and give Zakah; and those who believe in Our Ayat; Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawrah and the Injil.) 7:156-157 and,\nأَوَلَمْيَكُن لَّهُمْ ءَايَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(It is not a sign to them that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel knew it (as true))26:197 There are similar Ayat that affirm that the scholars of the Children of Israel know this fact from their divinely revealed Books. This is the end of Surat Ar-Ra`d, and all praise is due to Allah and all favors are from Him."

      "text": "Denying Resurrection after Death, is Strange\nAllah says to His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ .\nوَإِن تَعْجَبْ\n(And if you wonder.) at the rejection of the polytheists who deny Resurrection, even though they witness Allah's signs and evidences that He made in His creation which testify that He is able to do everything. Yet, they admit that Allah originated the creation of all things and brought them into existence after they were nothing. However, they deny Allah's claim that He will resurrect the world anew, even though they admit to what is more amazing than what they deny and reject. Therefore, it is amazing that they said,\nأَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ\n(When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation) It is an obvious fact to every sane and knowledgeable person that creating the heavens and earth is a greater feat than creating men, and that He Who has originated creation is more able to resurrect it anew,\nأَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَعْىَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بَلَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead Yes, He surely is able to do all things)46:33 Allah described those who deny Resurrection,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ\n(They are those who disbelieved in their Lord! They are those who will have iron chains linking their hands to their necks. ) They will be dragged in the Fire by these chains,\nوَأُوْلـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ\n(They will be dwellers of the Fire to abide therein forever.), for they will remain in Hell forever and will never escape it or be removed from it.\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَـتُ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"

      "text": "The Disbelievers ask for the Punishment to be delivered now!\nAllah said,\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ\n(They ask you to hasten), in reference to the disbelievers,\nبِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ\n(the evil before the good,) meaning, the punishment. Allah said in other Ayat that they said,\nوَقَالُواْ يأَيُّهَا الَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ - لَّوْ\nمَا تَأْتِينَا بِالْمَلَـئِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ - مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُواْ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ\n(And they say: \"O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur'an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful\" We send not the angels down except with the truth (i.e. for torment), and in that case, they (the disbelieves) would have no respite!)15:6-8, and two Ayat;\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ\n(And they ask you to hasten on the torment!)29:53-54 Allah also said,\nسَأَلَ سَآئِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ\n(A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall.) 70:1,\nيَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا الْحَقُّ\n(Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth.)42:18, and,\nوَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا\n(They say: \"Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana.)38:16, meaning, our due torment and reckoning. Allah said that they also supplicated,\nوَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ\n(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this (the Qur'an) is indeed the truth from You.)8:32 They were such rebellious, stubborn disbelievers that they asked the Messenger to bring them Allah's torment. Allah replied,\nوَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَـتُ\n(while exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them.) Meaning, `We have exerted Our punishment on the previous disbelieving nations, and made them a lesson and example for those who might take heed from their destruction.' If it was not for His forbearance and forgiveness, Allah would have indeed punished them sooner. Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ\n(And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the surface of the earth.)35:45 Allah said in this honorable Ayah,\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ\n(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing.) He is full of forgiveness, pardoning and covering the mistakes of people, in spite of their wrongdoing and the errors committed night and day. Allah next reminds that His punishment is severe, so that fear and hope are both addressed and mentioned. Allah said in other Ayat,\nفَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَسِعَةٍ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(If they belie you, say: \"Your Lord is the Owner of vast mercy, and never will His wrath be turned back from the people who are criminals.\")6:147\nإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)7:167, and,\nنَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ ٱلْعَذَابُ ٱلْأَلِيمُ\n(Declare unto My servants that truly I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.)15:49-50 There are many other Ayat that mention both fear and hope.\nوَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ"
