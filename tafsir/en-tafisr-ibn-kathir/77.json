      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

(39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.)

This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.)

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

      "text": "The driving of the Criminals to their Final Abode in Hell and how it will be done\nAllah informs about the disbelievers who deny the final abode, the recompense, Paradise, and the Hellfire. On the Day of Judgement it will be said to them:\nانطَلِقُواْ إِلَى مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ - انطَلِقُواْ إِلَى ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَـثِ شُعَبٍ\n(Depart you to that which you used to deny! Depart you to a shadow in three columns,) meaning, a flame of fire when it rises and ascends with smoke. So due to its severity and strength, it will have three columns.\nلاَّ ظَلِيلٍ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِنَ اللَّهَبِ\n(Neither shady nor of any use against the fierce flame of the Fire.) meaning, shade of the smoke that comes from the flame -- which itself will not have a shade, nor will it benefit against the flame. This means it will not protect them from the heat of the flame. Allah said,\nإِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ\n(Verily, it throws sparks as Al-Qasr,) meaning, its sparks will shoot out from its flame like huge castles. Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Like forts.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik who reported from Zayd bin Aslam and others said, \"This means the trunk of trees.\"\nكَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(As if they were Sufr camels.) means, black camels. This is the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Jarir favored this view. Ibn `Abbas Mujahid, and Sa`id bin Jubayr said about,\nجِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(Sufr camels.) \"Meaning ropes of ships.\"\nإِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ\n(Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks as Al-Qasr.) Imam Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said: \"We were directed to the timber a length of three cubits or more in order to use it for construction of buildings. We used to call it Al-Qasr.\nكَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(As if they were Sufr camels.) These (Jimalat) are ropes of ships that are bundled until they resemble the intestines of men.\"\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!)\nThe Inability of the Criminals to speak, make Excuses, or step forward on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ\n(That will be a Day when they shall not speak,) meaning, they will not speak.\nوَلاَ يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ\n(And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.) meaning, they will not be able to speak, nor will they be granted permission to speak so that they can make excuses. Rather, the proof will be established against them, and they will be called upon to speak about the wrong that they did, but they will not be able to say anything. The courts of the Day of Judgement will occur in stages. Sometimes the Lord informs of this stage and sometimes He informs of that stage. This is to show the terrors and calamities of that Day. Thus, after all the details of this discussion, He says:\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!) Then Allah says,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ جَمَعْنَـكُمْ وَالاٌّوَّلِينَ - فَإِن كَانَ لَكمُ كَيْدٌ فَكِيدُونِ\n(That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together! So if you have a plot, use it against Me!) This is an address from the Creator to His servants. He says to them,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ جَمَعْنَـكُمْ وَالاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together!) meaning, He will gather all of them by His power on one common plane, He will make them hear the caller and He will cause them to see. Then He says,\nفَإِن كَانَ لَكمُ كَيْدٌ فَكِيدُونِ\n(So, if you have a plot, use it against Me!) This is a serious threat and a harsh warning. It means, `if you are able to save yourselves from being seized by Me, and rescue yourselves from My ruling, then do so. But you are certainly not able to do so.' This is as Allah says,\nيمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُواْ مِنْ أَقْطَـرِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ فَانفُذُواْ لاَ تَنفُذُونَ إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(O assembly of Jinn and men! If you have power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) (55:33) Allah also says,\nوَلاَ تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئًا\n(And you will not harm Him in the least.) (11:57) It is narrated in a Hadith (that Allah said),\n«يَا عِبَادِي، إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُونِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوا ضَرِّي فَتَضُرُّونِي»\n(\"O My servants! You all can never attain My benefit and thereby benefit Me, and you all can never attain My harm and thereby harm Me.\")"

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

It means, `if you are able to save yourselves from being seized by Me, and rescue yourselves from My ruling, then do so. But you are certainly not able to do so.' This is as Allah says,\nيمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُواْ مِنْ أَقْطَـرِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ فَانفُذُواْ لاَ تَنفُذُونَ إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(O assembly of Jinn and men! If you have power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) (55:33) Allah also says,\nوَلاَ تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئًا\n(And you will not harm Him in the least.) (11:57) It is narrated in a Hadith (that Allah said),\n«يَا عِبَادِي، إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُونِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوا ضَرِّي فَتَضُرُّونِي»\n(\"O My servants!

Allah said,\nإِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ\n(Verily, it throws sparks as Al-Qasr,) meaning, its sparks will shoot out from its flame like huge castles. Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Like forts.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik who reported from Zayd bin Aslam and others said, \"This means the trunk of trees.\"\nكَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(As if they were Sufr camels.) means, black camels. This is the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Jarir favored this view. Ibn `Abbas Mujahid, and Sa`id bin Jubayr said about,\nجِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(Sufr camels.) \"Meaning ropes of ships.\"\nإِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ\n(Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks as Al-Qasr.) Imam Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said: \"We were directed to the timber a length of three cubits or more in order to use it for construction of buildings. We used to call it Al-Qasr.\nكَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ\n(As if they were Sufr camels.) These (Jimalat) are ropes of ships that are bundled until they resemble the intestines of men.\"\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!)\nThe Inability of the Criminals to speak, make Excuses, or step forward on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ\n(That will be a Day when they shall not speak,) meaning, they will not speak.\nوَلاَ يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ\n(And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.) meaning, they will not be able to speak, nor will they be granted permission to speak so that they can make excuses. Rather, the proof will be established against them, and they will be called upon to speak about the wrong that they did, but they will not be able to say anything. The courts of the Day of Judgement will occur in stages. Sometimes the Lord informs of this stage and sometimes He informs of that stage. This is to show the terrors and calamities of that Day. Thus, after all the details of this discussion, He says:\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!) Then Allah says,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ جَمَعْنَـكُمْ وَالاٌّوَّلِينَ - فَإِن كَانَ لَكمُ كَيْدٌ فَكِيدُونِ\n(That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together! So if you have a plot, use it against Me!) This is an address from the Creator to His servants. He says to them,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ جَمَعْنَـكُمْ وَالاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together!) meaning, He will gather all of them by His power on one common plane, He will make them hear the caller and He will cause them to see. Then He says,\nفَإِن كَانَ لَكمُ كَيْدٌ فَكِيدُونِ\n(So, if you have a plot, use it against Me!) This is a serious threat and a harsh warning. It means, `if you are able to save yourselves from being seized by Me, and rescue yourselves from My ruling, then do so. But you are certainly not able to do so.' This is as Allah says,\nيمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُواْ مِنْ أَقْطَـرِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ فَانفُذُواْ لاَ تَنفُذُونَ إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(O assembly of Jinn and men! If you have power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) (55:33) Allah also says,\nوَلاَ تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئًا\n(And you will not harm Him in the least.) (11:57) It is narrated in a Hadith (that Allah said),\n«يَا عِبَادِي، إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُونِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوا ضَرِّي فَتَضُرُّونِي»\n(\"O My servants! You all can never attain My benefit and thereby benefit Me, and you all can never attain My harm and thereby harm Me.\")"

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

(7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."

(77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."
