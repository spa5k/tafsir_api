  "text": "When the Soul reaches the Throat at the Time of Death, it cannot be brought back; this proves Reckon\nAllah the Exalted said,\nفَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ\n(Then why do you not (intervene) when it reaches), in reference to the soul,\nالْحُلْقُومَ\n(Al-Hulqum), i.e., the throat, at the time of death. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,\nكَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ - وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ - وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ - وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ\n(Nay, when (the soul) reaches to the collar bone, and it will be said: \"Who can cure him (and save him from death)\" And he will conclude that it was (the time) of parting (death); And one leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded). The drive will be on that Day to your Lord (Allah).)(75:26-30) Allah said here,\nوَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ\n(And you at the moment are looking,) at the dying person and witnessing the stupor of death that he is experiencing,\nوَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ\n(But We are nearer to him than you, ) with Our angels,\nوَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ\n(but you see not.) you cannot see the angels. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,\nوَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ - ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ\n(He is the Irresistible over His servants, and He sends guardians (angels) over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (angel of death and his assistants) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their true Protector. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.)(6:61-62) Allah's statement,\nفَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ تَرْجِعُونَهَآ\n(Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin -- return the soul,) means, `Will you not return this soul, that has reached the throat, to its body as it used to be, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense' Sa`id bin Jubayr and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said:\nفَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ\n(Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin. ..), \"If you do not believe that you will be reckoned, recompensed, resurrected and punished, then why do you not return this soul to its body\" Mujahid said that,\nغَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ\n(...if you are not Madinin), means, \"if you are not certain.\"",
