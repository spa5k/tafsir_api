  "text": "Only Truth will be of Benefit on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah answers His servant and Messenger `Isa, son of Maryam, after he disowns  the disbelieving Christians who lied about Allah and His Messenger, and when  `Isa refers their end to the will of his Lord,\nهَـذَا يَوْمُ  يَنفَعُ الصَّـدِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ\n(This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.) Ad-Dahhak  said that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"This is the Day when Tawhid will benefit those  who believed in it.\"\nلَهُمْ جَنَّـتٌ  تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً\n(Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise) -- they shall abide  therein forever.) and they will never be removed from it,\nرِّضِىَ اللَّهُ  عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ\n(Allah is pleased with them and they with Him.)\nوَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ  اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ\n(But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah.) 9:72 We will  mention the Hadiths about this Ayah 9:72 later on. Allah's statement,\nذلِكَ الْفَوْزُ  الْعَظِيمُ\n(That is the great success.) means, this is the great success, other than  which there is no greater success. Allah said in another Ayat,\nلِمِثْلِ هَـذَا  فَلْيَعْمَلِ الْعَـمِلُونَ\n(For the like of this let the workers work.) 37:61, and,\nوَفِى ذَلِكَ  فَلْيَتَنَافَسِ الْمُتَنَـفِسُونَ\n(And for this let (all) those strive who want to strive.) 83:26 Allah's  statement,\nللَّهِ مُلْكُ  السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا فِيهِنَّ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is  therein, and He is able to do all things.) means, He created everything, owns  everything, controls the affairs of everything and is able to do all things.  Therefore, everything and everyone are in His domain and under His power and  will. There is none like Him, nor is there rival, ancestor, son, or wife for  Him, nor a lord or god besides Him. Ibn Wahb said that he heard Huyay bin  `Abdullah saying that Abu `Abdur-Rahman Al-Habli said that `Abdullah bin `Amr  said, \"The last revealed Surah was Surat Al-Ma'idah.\"",
