  "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nهَمَّازٍ مَّشَّآءِ بِنَمِيمٍ\n(Hammaz, going about with slander) (68:11) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Humazah Lumazah means one who reviles and disgraces (others).\" Mujahid said, \"Al-Humazah is with the hand and the eye, and Al-Lumazah is with the tongue.\" Then Allah says,\nالَّذِى جَمَعَ مَالاً وَعَدَّدَهُ\n(Who has gathered wealth and counted it.) meaning, he gathers it piling some of it on top of the rest and he counts it up. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nوَجَمَعَ فَأَوْعَى\n(And collect (wealth) and hide it.) (70:18) This was said by As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir. Muhammad bin Ka`b said concerning Allah's statement,\nجَمَعَ مَالاً وَعَدَّدَهُ\n(gathered wealth and counted it.) \"His wealth occupies his time in the day, going from this to that. Then when the night comes he sleeps like a rotting corpse.\" Then Allah says,\nيَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُ أَخْلَدَهُ\n(He thinks that his wealth will make him last forever!) meaning, he thinks that gathering wealth will make him last forever in this abode (the worldly life).\nكَلاَّ\n(But no!) meaning, the matter is not as he claims, nor as he reckons. Then Allah says,\nلَيُنبَذَنَّ فِى الْحُطَمَةِ\n(Verily, he will be thrown into Al-Hutamah.) meaning, the person who gathered wealth and counted it, will be thrown into Al-Hutamah, which is one of the descriptive names of the Hellfire. This is because it crushes whoever is in it. Thus, Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحُطَمَةُ - نَارُ اللَّهِ الْمُوقَدَةُ - الَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الاٌّفْئِدَةِ\n(And what will make you know what Al-Hutamah is The fire of Allah, Al-Muqadah, which leaps up over the hearts.) Thabit Al-Bunani said, \"It will burn them all the way to their hearts while they are still alive.\" Then he said, \"Indeed the torment will reach them.\" Then he cried. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"It (the Fire) will devour every part of his body until it reaches his heart and comes to the level of his throat, then it will return to his body.\"\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ\n(Verily, it shall Mu'sadah upon them.) meaning, covering, just as was mentioned in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Balad (see 90:20). Then Allah says,\nفِى عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةِ\n(In pillars stretched forth. ) \"Atiyah Al-`Awfi said, \"Pillars of Iron.\" As-Suddi said, \"Made of fire.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"He will make them enter pillars stretched forth, meaning there will be columns over them, and they will have chains on their necks, and the gates (of Hell) will be shut upon them.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Humazah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.",
