(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light.) 14:1 Allah said next,\nوَلِيُنذَرُواْ بِهِ\n(in order that they may be warned thereby), or to receive and draw lessons from it,\nوَلِيَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـهٌ وَاحِدٌ\n(and that they may know that He is the only One God) using its proofs and evidences that testify that there is no true deity except Allah,\nوَلِيَذَّكَّرَ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ\n(and that men of understanding may take heed.) meaning those who have good minds. aThis is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ibrahim, and all praise is due to Allah.",
