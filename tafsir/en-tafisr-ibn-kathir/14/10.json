  "text": "The Argument between the Prophets and the Disbelievers\nAllah narrates to us the arguments that ensued between the disbelievers and their Messengers. When their nations doubted the Message of worshipping Allah alone without partners, the Messengers said,\nأَفِى اللَّهِ شَكٌّ\n((What!) Can there be a doubt about Allah...) about His Lordship and having the exclusive right to be worshipped alone, being the only Creator of all creatures Verily, none besides Allah is worthy of worship, alone without partners with Him. Most nations were, and still are, affirming the existence of the Creator, but they call upon intermediaries besides Him whom they think will benefit them or bring them closer to Allah. Their Messengers said to them,\nيَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ\n(He calls you that He may forgive you of your sins) in the Hereafter,\nوَيُؤَخِّرْكُمْ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى\n(and give you respite for a term appointed.), in this worldly life. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ\n(Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) 10:3 However, their nations went on arguing against their prophethood, after they had to submit to the first evidence (that Allah Alone created everything).\nDisbelievers reject Prophethood because the Messengers were Humans!\nTheir nations said,\nإِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا\n(You are no more than human beings like us!) so why should we follow you just because you say so, even though we did not witness a miracle by your hands,\nفَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Then bring us a clear authority.), a miracle of our choice.\nقَالَتْ لَهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ إِن نَّحْنُ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ\n(Their Messengers said to them: \"We are no more than human beings like you...\") affirming that truly, they were only human being like their nations,\nوَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَمُنُّ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ\n(but Allah bestows His grace to whom He wills of His servants.), with prophethood and messengership which is His choice,\nوَمَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نَّأْتِيَكُمْ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(It is not ours to bring you an authority) according to your choice,\nإِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ\n((except by the permission of Allah. ), after we beg Him and He provides us with a miracle,\nوَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ\n(And in Allah (alone) let the believers put their trust.) in all their affairs. Their Messengers said to them next,\nوَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نَتَوَكَّلَ عَلَى اللَّهِ\n(And why should we not put our trust in Allah), after He had guided us to the best, most clear and plain way,\nوَلَنَصْبِرَنَّ عَلَى مَآ آذَيْتُمُونَا\n(And we shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us), such as foolish actions and abusive statements,\nوَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ\n(and in Allah (alone) let those who trust, put their trust.)",
