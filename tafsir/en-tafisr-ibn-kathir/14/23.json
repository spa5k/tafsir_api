  "text": "Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ\n`(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.) by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah's promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.' Allah said in another Ayah,\nيَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً\n(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.) 4:120\nوَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ\n(I had no authority over you) Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,\nإِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى\n(except that I called you, and you responded to me.) even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,\nفَلاَ تَلُومُونِى\n(So blame me not,) today,\nوَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ\n(but blame yourselves.), because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.' Shaytan will say next,\nمَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ\n(I cannot help you), I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,\nوَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِىَّ\n(nor can you help me.), nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,\nإِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ\n(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.) or because you associated me with Allah before,' according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; \"I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\" This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:5-6 and,\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)19:82 Allah said next,\nإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Verily, the wrongdoers), who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,\nأَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ\n(Did you say unto men: \"Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah\") 5:116 until,\nقَالَ اللَّهُ هَـذَا يَوْمُ يَنفَعُ الصَّـدِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ\n(Allah will say: \"This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.\")5:119 Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,\nوَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى\n(I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones,\nوَأُدْخِلَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ\n(And those who believed and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow,) wherever they wish them to flow and wherever they may be,\nخَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ\n(to dwell therein for ever,) and will never transfer or be transferred from it,\nبِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ\n(with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: \"Salam (peace!). \") Allah said in other Ayat,\nحَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُـمْ\n(Till, when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you!)\") 39:73\nوَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍسَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ\n(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you!).\") 13:23-24\nوَيُلَقَّوْنَ فِيهَا تَحِيَّةً وَسَلَـماً\n(Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect.) 25:75\nدَعْوَهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَـنَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(Their way of request therein will be Subhanaka Allahumma (glory to you, O Allah) and Salam (peace!) will be their greetings therein (Paradise)! And the close of their request will be: Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabbil-'Alamin all praise to Allah the Lord of that exists.)10:10",
