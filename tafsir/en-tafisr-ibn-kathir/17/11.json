  "text": "Man's Haste and Prayers against Himself\nAllah tells us about man's haste and how he sometimes prays against himself or his children or his wealth, praying for something bad to happen for them, or for them to die or be destroyed, invoking curses, etc. If Allah were to answer his prayer, he would be destroyed because of it, as Allah says:\nوَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ الشَّرَّ\n(And were Allah to hasten for mankind the evil...) 10:11 This is how it was interpreted by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. We have already discussed the Hadith:\n«لَا تَدْعُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ، وَلَا عَلَى أَمْوَالِكُمْ أَنْ تُوَافِقُوا مِنَ اللهِ سَاعَةَ إِجَابَةٍ يَسْتَجِيبُ فِيهَا»\n(Do not pray against yourselves or your wealth, for that might coincide with a time when Allah answers prayers.) What makes the son of Adam do that is his anxiety and haste. Allah says:\nوَكَانَ الإِنْسَـنُ عَجُولاً\n(And man is ever hasty.) Salman Al-Farisi and Ibn `Abbas mentioned the story of Adam, when he wanted to get up before his soul reached his feet. When his soul was breathed into him, it entered his body from his head downwards. When it reached his brain he sneezed, and said, \"Al-Hamdu Lillah\" (praise be to Allah), and Allah said, \"May your Lord have mercy on you, O Adam.\" When it reached his eyes, he opened them, and when it reached his body and limbs he started to stare at them in wonder. He wanted to get up before it reached his feet, but he could not. He said, \"O Lord, make it happen before night comes.\"",
