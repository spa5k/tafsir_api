  "text": "Allah's Power in His creation of the Animals\nAllah mentions His complete and almighty power to create all the different kinds of animals with their various forms, colors and ways of moving and stopping, from one kind of water.\nفَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى بَطْنِهِ\n(Of them there are some that creep on their bellies,) like snakes and so on;\nوَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى رِجْلَيْنِ\n(and some that walk on two legs,) like humans and birds;\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ\n(and some that walk on four,) like cattle and all kinds of animals. Allah says:\nيَخْلُقُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ\n(Allah creates what He wills.) meaning by His power, because what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. So he says:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Verily, Allah is able to do all things.)",
