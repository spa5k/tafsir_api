Allah said,\nقُل لَّن تَتَّبِعُونَا كَذَلِكُمْ قَالَ اللَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ\n(Say: \"You shall not follow us; thus Allah has said beforehand.\") `when He promised the participants of Al-Hudaybiyyah before you asked to join them,'\nفَسَيَقُولُونَ بَلْ تَحْسُدُونَنَا\n(Then they will say: \"Nay, you envy us.\") `you do not want us to share the war spoils with you,'\nبَلْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(Nay, but they under- stand not except a little.) the truth is nothing close to what they claimed, but they understand not.",
