Then Allah says:\nوَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يُبْلِسُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ\n(And on the Day when the Hour will be established, the criminals will be plunged into destruction with despair.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"The sinners will be filled with despair.\" Mujahid said, \"The sinners will be exposed;\" according to another report he said, \"The sinners will grieve.\"\nوَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ مِّن شُرَكَآئِهِمْ شُفَعَاءُ\n(No intercessors will they have from those whom they made equal with Allah,) means, the gods whom they used to worship instead of Allah will not intercede for them; they will reject them and betray them despite their desperate need of them. Then Allah says:\nوَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَفَرَّقُونَ\n(And on the Day when the Hour will be established -- that Day shall (all men) be separated.) Qatadah said: \"By Allah, this refers to the separation after which there will be no reunion.\" In other words, if one person is taken up to the highest heights and another is sent down to the lowest depths of Hell, that is the last they will ever see of one another. Allah says:\nفَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ فَهُمْ فِى رَوْضَةٍ يُحْبَرُونَ\n(Then as for those who believed and did righteous good deeds, such shall be honored and made to enjoy a luxurious life in a Garden of Delight.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"This means, they will enjoy a life of luxury.\"",
