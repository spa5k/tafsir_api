  "text": "Parables in the Qur'an and how the Disbelievers do not learn from them\nوَلَقَدْ ضَرَبْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِى هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ\n(And indeed We have set forth for mankind, in this Qur'an every kind of parable.) means, `We have explained the truth to them and have made it clear to them, and have set forth for them parables so that they may understand the truth and follow it.'\nوَلَئِن جِئْتَهُمْ بِـَايَةٍ لَّيَقُولَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ مُبْطِلُونَ\n(But if you bring to them any sign or proof, the disbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): \"You follow nothing but falsehood and magic.\") If they were to see any kind of sign, whether it was at their own direction or otherwise, they would not believe in it and they would think that it was magic and falsehood, as they said when the moon was cleft asunder, etc., as Allah says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ\n(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) (10:96-97). Allah says here:\nكَذَلِكَ يَطْبَعُ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ\n(Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who know not. So be patient. Verily, the promise of Allah is true;) meaning, `bear their stubborn opposition with patience, for Allah will fulfill His promise to grant you victory over them and cause you and those who follow you to prevail in this world and in the Hereafter.'\nوَلاَ يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُوقِنُونَ\n(and let not those who have no certainty of faith discourage you (from conveying Allah's Message).) `Remain steadfast in the mission with which Allah has sent you, for it is truth in which there is no doubt. Do not turn away from it, for nowhere else is there truth which is to be followed; the truth rests exclusively in the Message with which you have been sent.'\nReports concerning the Virtues of this Surah and that it is recommended to recite it during Fajr\nImam Ahmad recorded from a man among the Companions of the Prophet that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ led them in Fajr prayer and recited Ar-Rum in the prayer, but he became confused in his recitation. He said:\n«إِنَّهُ يَلْبِسُ عَلَيْنَا الْقُرْآنَ، فَإِنَّ أَقْوَامًا مِنْكُمْ يُصَلُّونَ مَعَنَا لَا يُحْسِنُونَ الْوُضُوءَ، فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الصَّلَاةَ مَعَنَا فَلْيُحْسِنِ الْوُضُوء»\n(We have become confused in our recitation of Qur'an, because some people among you are praying with us but they have not performed Wudu' properly. Whoever attends the prayer with us, let him perform Wudu' properly.) This has a Hasan chain of narration, the text itself is Hasan. It contains amazing information, that the Prophet was affected by the faulty Wudu' of some of those whom he was leading in prayer. This indicates that the prayer of the person who is praying in the congregation is connected to the prayer of the Imam. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ar-Rum. Allah's is the praise and thanks.",
