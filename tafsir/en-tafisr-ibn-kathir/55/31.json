  "text": "A Warning for Humans and Jinn\nIbn Jurayj said that the Ayah,\nسَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ\n(We shall attend to you,) means, `We shall judge you,' while Al-Bukhari said that it means, \"We shall recompense you. Surely, nothing will busy Allah from attending to anything else.\" This type of speech pattern is common in the Arabic language. For example, one would say, \"I will attend to you,\" even when one is not busy with anything else. Allah's saying;\nأَيُّهَا الثَّقَلاَنِ\n(O you Thaqalan!) refers to the humans and the Jinns, as in the Hadith;\n«يَسْمَعُهَا كُلُّ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا الثَّقَلَيْن»\n(Everyone will be able to hear it, except the Thaqalayn.) In another narration that explains it, the Prophet said,\n«إِلَّا الْإِنْسَ وَالْجِن»\n(...except mankind and the Jinns.) Allah said,\nفَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ\n(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny), then,\nيمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُواْ مِنْ أَقْطَـرِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ فَانفُذُواْ لاَ تَنفُذُونَ إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(O assembly of Jinn and men! If you are able to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) meaning, `you will never be able to escape Allah's orders and decrees, because it encompasses you. You will never be able to avoid or avert His rule and judgement over you, you are surrounded by it wherever you may be.' This is also about the Gathering when the angels, comprising seven lines in every direction, will surround the creatures. None of the creatures will be able to escape on that Day,\nإِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ\n(except with authority) meaning, except with the commandment from Allah,\nيَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ - كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ\n(On that Day man will say: \"Where (is the refuge) to flee\" No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.)(75:10-12),\nوَالَّذِينَ كَسَبُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ جَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ بِمِثْلِهَا وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ مَّا لَهُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ كَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ قِطَعًا مِّنَ الَّيْلِ مُظْلِماً أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ\n(And those who earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and humiliating disgrace will cover them. No defender will they have from Allah. Their faces will be covered as it were with pieces from the darkness of night. They are the dwellers of Fire, they will abide therein forever.)(10:27) Allah's statement,\nيُرْسَلُ عَلَيْكُمَا شُوَاظٌ مِّن نَّارٍ وَنُحَاسٌ فَلاَ تَنتَصِرَانِ\n(There will be sent against you both, Shuwaz of fire and Nuhas, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that Shuwaz is the flame of fire. Abu Salih said, \"It is the flame above the fire below the smoke.\" Ad-Dahhak said,\nشُوَاظٌ مِّن نَّارٍ\n(Shuwaz of fire) \"A flood of fire.\" Allah said;\nوَنُحَاسٌ\n(and Nuhas) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas; \"The smoke of the fire.\" Similar was reported from Abu Salih, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Sinan. Ibn Jarir said that the Arabs used to call the smoke of the fire, Nuhas and Nihas. But he said that the scholars of Qur'anic recitation said that in this Ayah, the word recited is Nuhas. Mujahid said, \"Molten brass poured over their heads.\" Qatadah held the same view. Ad-Dahhak said,\"Nuhas is liquid copper.\" The Ayah means, `if you, mankind and the Jinns, try to escape on the Day of Resurrection, then the angels, including those among them who guard Hellfire, will bring you back by directing smoke of fire and molten brass on you.' Allah's statement,\nفَلاَ تَنتَصِرَانِفَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ\n(and you will not be able to defend yourselves. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)\nفَإِذَا انشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ فَكَانَتْ وَرْدَةً كَالدِّهَانِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ",
