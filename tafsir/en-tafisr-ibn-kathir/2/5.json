Allah then said,\nعَلَى هُدًى\n(On guidance) meaning, they are (following) a light, guidance, and have insight from Allah,\nوَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ\n(And they are the successful) meaning, in this world and the Hereafter. They shall have what they seek and be saved from the evil that they tried to avoid. Therefore, they will have rewards, eternal life in Paradise, and safety from the torment that Allah has prepared for His enemies.",
