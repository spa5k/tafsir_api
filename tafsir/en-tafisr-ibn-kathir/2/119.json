  "text": "Allah's statement;\nوَلاَ تُسْـَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْجَحِيمِ\n(And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.) means, \"We shall not ask you about the disbelief of those who rejected you.\" Similarly, Allah said,\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(Your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.) (13:40)\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them (O Muhammad ) ـ you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.)(88:21-22) and,\nنَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِجَبَّارٍ فَذَكِّرْ بِالْقُرْءَانِ مَن يَخَافُ وَعِيدِ\n(We know best what they say. And you (O Muhammad ) are not the one to force them (to belief). But warn by the Qur'an; him who fears My threat) (50:45).\nThere are many other similar Ayat.\nThe Description of the Prophet in the Tawrah\nImam Ahmad recorded `Ata' bin Yasar saying that he met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, \"Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the Torah.\" He said, \"Yes, by Allah, he is described by the Torah with the same characteristics that he is described with in the Qur'an with: `O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, a bringer of good news, a warner, and as safe refuge for the unlettered people. You are My servant and Messenger. I have called you the Mutawakkil (who depends and relies on Allah for each and everything). You are not harsh, nor hard, nor obnoxious in the bazaars. He does not reward the evil deed with an evil deed. Rather, he forgives and pardons. Allah will not bring his life to an end, until he straightens the wicked's religion by his hands so that the people proclaim: There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. By his hands, Allah will open blind eyes, deaf ears and sealed hearts.\"' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari only.",
