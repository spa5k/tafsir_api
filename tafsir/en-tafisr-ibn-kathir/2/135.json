Therefore, follow us, O Muhammad, and you will be rightly guided.\" Also, the Christians said similarly, so Allah revealed,\nوَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى تَهْتَدُواْ\n(And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.\") Allah's statement,\nقُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا\n(Say (to them O Muhammad ), \"Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim, Hanif) means, \"We do not need the Judaism or Christianity that you call us to, rather,\nمِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفاً\n((we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim, Hanif) meaning, on the straight path, as Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and `Isa bin Jariyah stated. Also, Abu Qilabah said, \"The Hanif is what the Messengers, from beginning to end, believed in.\")",
