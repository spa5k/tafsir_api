  "text": "When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:\nأَنَّى يَكُونُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا\n(How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,\nوَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ الْمَالِ\n(when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.\nTheir Prophet answered them:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَـهُ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.' Their Prophet stated, \"I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.\" Further:\nوَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ\n(...and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.' He then said:\nوَاللَّهُ يُؤْتِى مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَآءُ\n(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:\nوَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ\n(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.",
