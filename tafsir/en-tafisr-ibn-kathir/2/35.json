  "text": "Adam was honored again\nAllah honored Adam by commanding the angels to prostrate before him, so they all complied except for Iblis. Allah then allowed Adam to live and eat wherever and whatever he wished in Paradise. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Dharr saying, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Was Adam a Prophet' He said,\n«نَعَمْ نَبِيًّا رَسُولًا كَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ قُبُلًا»\n(Yes. He was a Prophet and a Messenger to whom Allah spoke directly), meaning\nاسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ\n((O Adam!) Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise.)\"\nHawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise\nThe Ayah (2:35) indicates that Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise, as Muhammad bin Ishaq stated. Ibn Ishaq said, \"After Allah finished criticizing Iblis, and after teaching Adam the names of everything, He said,\nيَـاءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ\n(O Adam! Inform them of their names) until,\nإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ\n(Verily, You are the Knower, the Wise.)\nThen Adam fell asleep, as the People of the Book and other scholars such as Ibn `Abbas have stated, Allah took one of Adam's left ribs and made flesh grow in its place, while Adam was asleep and unaware. Allah then created Adam's wife, Hawwa', from his rib and made her a woman, so that she could be a comfort for him. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa' next to him, it was claimed, he said, `My flesh and blood, my wife.' Hence, Adam reclined with Hawwa'. When Allah married Adam to Hawwa' and gave him comfort, Allah said to him directly,\nيَاءَادَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الْظَّـلِمِينَ\n(\"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin (wrongdoers).\").\"\nAllah tests Adam\nAllah's statement to Adam,\nوَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ\n(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Some said that it was the grape tree, barley, date tree, fig tree, and so forth. Some said that it was a certain tree, and whoever eats from it will be relieved of the call of nature. It was also said that it was a tree from which the angels eat so that they live for eternity. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. It is possible that it was one of those trees. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.\" This is similar to what Ar-Razi stated in his Tafsir, and this is the correct opinion. Allah's statement,\nفَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَـنُ عَنْهَا\n(Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom) either refers to Paradise, and in this case, it means that Shaytan led Adam and Hawwa' away from it, as `Asim bin Abi An-Najud recited it. It is also possible that this Ayah refers to the forbidden tree. In this case, the Ayah would mean, as Al-Hasan and Qatadah stated, \"He tripped them.\" In this case,\nفَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَـنُ عَنْهَا\n(Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom)\nmeans, \"Because of the tree\", just as Allah said,\nيُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ\n(Turned aside therefrom (i.e. from Muhammad and the Qur'an) is he who is turned aside (by the decree and preordainment of Allah)) (51:9) meaning, the deviant person becomes turned aside - or slips - from the truth because of so and so reason. This is why then Allah said,\nفَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ\n(And got them out from that in which they were) meaning, the clothes, spacious dwelling and comfortable sustenance.\nوَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُواْ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِى الأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَـعٌ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(We said: \"Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.\") meaning, dwelling, sustenance and limited life, until the commencement of the Day of Resurrection\nAdam was very Tall\nIbn Abi Hatim narrated that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةٌ سَحُوقٌ، فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إلى عَوْرتِه جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ؟ فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلامَ الرَّحْمنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا ولَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاء»\n(Allah created Adam tall, with thick hair, just as a date tree with full branches. When Adam ate from the forbidden tree, his cover fell off, and the first thing that appeared was his private area. When he saw his private area, he ran away in Paradise and his hair got caught in a tree. He tried to free himself and Ar-Rahman called him, 'O Adam! Are you running away from Me' When Adam heard the words of Ar-Rahman (Allah), he said, 'No, O my Lord! But I am shy.')\nAdam remained in Paradise for an Hour\nAl-Hakim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Adam was allowed to reside in Paradise during the time period between the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer, until sunset.\" Al-Hakim then commented this is \"Sahih according to the Two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim), but they did not include it in their collections.\" Also, Ibn Abi Hatim recorded Ibn `Abbas saying, \"Allah sent Adam to earth to an area called, Dahna, between Makkah and At-Ta'if.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Adam was sent down to India, while Hawwa' was sent to Jeddah. Iblis was sent down to Dustumaysan, several miles from Basra. Further, the snake was sent down to Asbahan. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«خَيْرُ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ الشَّمْسُ يَوْمُ الْجُمُعَةِ فِيهِ خُلِقَ آدَمُ وَفِيهِ أُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ وَفِيهِ أُخْرِجَ مِنْهَا»\n(Friday is the best day on which the sun has risen. On Friday, Allah created Adam, admitted him into Paradise, and expelled him from it.)\nA Doubt and a Rebuttal\nIf one asks, \"If the Paradise that Adam was thrown out of was in heaven, as the majority of the scholars assert, then is it possible for Iblis to enter Paradise, although he was expelled from it by Allah's decision (when he refused to prostrate before Adam)\"\nBasically, the response to this would be that the Paradise which Adam was in, was in the heavens, not on the earth, as we explained in the beginning of our book Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah.\nThe majority of scholars said that Shaytan was originally prohibited from entering Paradise, but there were times when he sneaked into it in secret. For instance, the Tawrah stated that Iblis hid inside the snake's mouth and entered Paradise. Some scholars said that it is possible that Shaytan led Adam and Hawwa' astray on his way out of Paradise. Some scholars said that he led Adam and Hawwa' astray when he was on earth, while they were still in heaven, as stated by Az-Zamakhshari. Al-Qurtubi mentioned several beneficial Hadiths here about snakes and the ruling on killing them.",
