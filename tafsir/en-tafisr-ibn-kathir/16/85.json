  "text": "Homes, Furnishings and Clothing are also Blessings from Allah\nAllah mentions His great blessings for His servant in that He has given them homes to dwell in and protect themselves with, in which they find all kinds of benefits. He has also given them homes from the hides of cattle, i.e., leather, which are light and easy to carry on journeys and can be erected wherever they stop, whether they are traveling or are settled. Thus Allah says:\nتَسْتَخِفُّونَهَا يَوْمَ ظَعْنِكُمْ وَيَوْمَ إِقَـمَتِكُمْ\n(which you find so light when you travel and when you camp;)\nوَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ\n(out of their wool, fur and hair) refers to sheep, camels and goats respectively.\nأَثَـثاً\n(furnishings) meaning what you take from them, i.e., wealth. It was also said that it means articles of convenience, or clothing. The correct view is more general in meaning than this; it means that you make carpets, clothing and other things from their wool, hair etc., which you use as wealth and for trade. Ibn `Abbas said: `Al-Athath means articles of convenience and comfort.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah. The phrase,\nإِلَى حِينٍ\n(for a while) means, until the appointed time.\nShade, Places of Refuge in the Mountains, Garments and Coats of Mail are also Blessings from Allah\nوَاللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّمَّا خَلَقَ ظِلَـلاً\n(And Allah has made shade for you out of that which He has created,) Qatadah said: \"This means trees.\"\nوَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْجِبَالِ أَكْنَـناً\n(and He has made places of refuge in the mountains for you,) meaning fortresses and strongholds.\nجَعَلَ لَكُمُسَرَابِيلَ تَقِيكُمُ الْحَرَّ\n(and He has made garments for you to protect you from the heat,) meaning clothing of cotton, linen and wool.\nوَسَرَبِيلَ تَقِيكُم بَأْسَكُمْ\n(and coats of mail to protect you from your violence.) such as shields made of layers of sheet iron, coats of mail and so on.\nكَذَلِكَ يُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(Thus does He perfect His favor for you,) meaning, thus He gives you what you need to go about your business, so that this will help you to worship and obey Him.\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْلِمُونَ\n(that you may submit yourselves to His will). This is interpreted by the majority to mean submitting to Allah or becoming Muslim.\nAll the Messenger has to do is convey the Message\nفَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ\n(Then, if they turn away,) meaning, after this declaration and reminder, do not worry about them.\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ الْمُبِينُ\n(your duty (O Muhammad) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way), and you have delivered the Message to them.\nيَعْرِفُونَ نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنكِرُونَهَا\n(They recognize the grace of Allah, yet they deny it) meaning they know that Allah is the One Who grants these blessings to them, and that He is Bountiful towards them, but they still deny this by worshipping others besides Him and thinking that their help and provisions come from others besides Him.\nوَأَكْثَرُهُمُ الْكَـفِرُونَ\n(and most of them are disbelievers.)\nوَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا ثُمَّ لاَ يُؤْذَنُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ\nوَإِذَا رَأى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الْعَذَابَ فَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ- وَإِذَا رَءا الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ شُرَكَآءهُمْ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا هَـؤُلآء شُرَكَآؤُنَا الَّذِينَ كُنَّا نَدْعُوْا مِن دُونِكَ فَألْقَوْا إِلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلَ إِنَّكُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ- وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ-",
