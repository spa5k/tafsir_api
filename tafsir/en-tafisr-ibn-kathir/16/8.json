It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Jabir bin `Abdullah said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade us to eat the meat of domestic donkeys, but he allowed us to eat the meat of horses.\" Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud reported with two chains of narration, each of which meet the conditions of Muslim, that Jabir said: \"On the day of Khaybar we slaughtered horses, mules and donkeys. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade us from eating the mules and donkeys, but he did not forbid us from eating the horses.\" According to Sahih Muslim, Asma' bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: \"At the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ we slaughtered a horse and ate it when we were in Al-Madinah.\"",
