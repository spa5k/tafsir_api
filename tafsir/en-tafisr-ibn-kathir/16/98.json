  "text": "The Command to seek Refuge with Allah before reciting the Qur'an\nThis is a command from Allah to His servants upon the tongue of His Prophet , telling them that when they want to read Qur'an, they should seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Shaytan. The Hadiths mentioned about seeking refuge with Allah (Isti`adhah), were quoted in our discussion at the beginning of this Tafsir, praise be to Allah. The reason for seeking refuge with Allah before reading is that the reader should not get confused or mixed up, and that the Shaytan would not confuse him or stop him from thinking about and pondering over the meaning of what he reads. Hence the majority of scholars said that refuge should be sought with Allah before starting to read.\nإِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ\n(Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord.) Ath-Thawri said: \"He has no power to make them commit a sin they will not repent from.\" Others said: it means that he has no argument for them. Others said it is like the Ayah:\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Except Your chosen servants amongst them.) 15:40\nإِنَّمَا سُلْطَـنُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ\n(His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Shaytan), ) Mujahid said: \"Those who obey him.\" Others said, \"Those who take him as their protector instead of Allah.\"\nوَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ\n(and those who join partners with Him.) means, those who associate others in worship with Allah.",
