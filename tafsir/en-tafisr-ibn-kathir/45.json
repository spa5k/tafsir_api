      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nA Directive to contemplate over Allah's Ayat\nAllah directs His servants to contemplate His favors and gifts, as well as His great power that is demonstrated by His creating the heavens and the earth and the various types and categories of creatures in them. There are the angels, Jinns, humans, animals, birds, beasts, carnivores, insects and various kinds of sea creatures. The night and day alternate, each follows the other in succession, never ceasing to come, as decreed. One brings darkness and one brings light. Allah the Exalted also sends down the rain from the clouds when it is most needed. He is calling the rain, `provision', because it is the resource that produces various provisions,\nفَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا\n(and revives therewith the earth after its death,) after it was dry and had no vegetation or life of any kind. Allah said next,\nوَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ\n(and in the turning about of the winds,) sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north. Some are easterly winds and some are westerly winds, some bringing sea breezes and some blow from the land, some coming at night and some by day. Some winds bring rain, some cause pollination and some winds just revive the soul, while some others bear no benefit. Allah said first.\nلاّيَـتٍ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(are signs for the believers), then\nيُوقِنُونَ\n(who have faith with certainty), then\nيَعْقِلُونَ\n(who understand), thus ascending from one honorable stage to what is more honorable and higher in grade. These Ayat are similar to an Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah\nإِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that He has spread therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding.)

Allah said,\nوَإِذَا عَلِمَ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا شَيْئاً اتَّخَذَهَا هُزُواً\n(And when he learns something of Our Ayat, he makes them a jest.) if he learns anything from the Qur'an, he disbelieves in it and takes it as the subject of jest and ridicule,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ\n(For such there will be a humiliating torment.) as recompense for ridiculing the Qur'an and jesting about it. In the Sahih, Muslim recorded from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  prohibited traveling with the Qur'an to enemy lands for fear that the Qur'an might be desecrated by the enemy. Allah explained the type of torment that these people earn on the Day of Return;\nمِّن وَرَآئِهِمْ جَهَنَّمُ\n(In front of them there is Hell.) meaning, all those who have these evil characteristics will end up in Hellfire on the Day of Resurrection,\nوَلاَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُم مَّا كَسَبُواْ شَيْئاً\n(And that which they have earned will be of no profit to them, ) their wealth and children will not avail them,\nوَلاَ مَا اتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ\n(nor those whom they have taken as protecting friends besides Allah.) nor will the false gods that they worshipped besides Allah benefit them in the least,\nوَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عظِيمٌ\n(And theirs will be a great torment.) Allah the Exalted said,\nهَـذَا هُدًى\n(This is Huda (guidance).) in reference to the Qur'an,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مِّن رِّجْزٍ أَلِيمٌ\n(And those who disbelieve in the Ayat of their Lord, for them there is a painful torment of Rijz.) that is agonizing and severe.

So it all comes from Him without rivals to dispute His authority; surely, this fact is completely certain.\" Allah said.\nإِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ\n(Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.)\nThe Command to be Patient with the Harm of Idolators\nAllah's saying;\nقُل لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ يَغْفِرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ\n(Say to the believers to forgive those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) means, let the believers forgive the disbelievers and endure the harm that they direct against them. In the beginning of Islam, Muslims were ordered to observe patience in the face of the oppression of the idolators and the People of the Scriptures so that their hearts may incline towards Islam. However, when the disbelievers persisted in stubbornness, Allah legislated for the believers to fight in Jihad. Statements of this meaning were collected from `Abdullah bin `Abbas and Qatadah. Mujahid said about Allah's statement,\nلاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ\n(those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) \"They do not appreciate Allah's favors.\" Allah said,\nلِيَجْزِىَ قَوْماً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ\n(that He may recompense people, according to what they have earned.) meaning, if the believers forgive the disbelievers in this life, Allah will still punish the disbelievers for their evil in the Hereafter. Allah's statement next,\nمَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(Whosoever does a good deed, it is for himself, and whosoever does evil, it is against (himself). Then to your Lord you will be made to return.) meaning, you will all return to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, when you and your actions will be displayed before Him. Then, He will recompense you for your deeds, good for good and evil for evil.\nوَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ - وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بِيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ - ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ"

There are the angels, Jinns, humans, animals, birds, beasts, carnivores, insects and various kinds of sea creatures. The night and day alternate, each follows the other in succession, never ceasing to come, as decreed. One brings darkness and one brings light. Allah the Exalted also sends down the rain from the clouds when it is most needed. He is calling the rain, `provision', because it is the resource that produces various provisions,\nفَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا\n(and revives therewith the earth after its death,) after it was dry and had no vegetation or life of any kind. Allah said next,\nوَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ\n(and in the turning about of the winds,) sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north. Some are easterly winds and some are westerly winds, some bringing sea breezes and some blow from the land, some coming at night and some by day. Some winds bring rain, some cause pollination and some winds just revive the soul, while some others bear no benefit. Allah said first.\nلاّيَـتٍ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(are signs for the believers), then\nيُوقِنُونَ\n(who have faith with certainty), then\nيَعْقِلُونَ\n(who understand), thus ascending from one honorable stage to what is more honorable and higher in grade. These Ayat are similar to an Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah\nإِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that He has spread therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding.)

At--Tabarani recorded that Shu`bah said that `Amr bin Murrah narrated that Abu Ad-Duha said that Masruq said that Tamim Ad-Dari once stood in voluntary prayer through the night until the morning only reciting this Ayah,\nأَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds) Allah said in reply:\nسَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ\n(Worst is the judgement that they make.) Allah said,\nوَخَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth,) meaning, in justice,\nوَلِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.) Allah the Exalted said,\nأَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَـهَهُ هَوَاهُ\n(Have you seen him who takes his own lust as his god), who abides by his lust, and whatever his lust portrays as good he implements it, and whatever his lust portrays as evil, he abandons it! Allah's statement,\nوَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ\n(And Allah left him astray with knowledge, ) has two meanings. One of them is that Allah knew that this person deserves to be misguided, so He left him astray. The second meaning is that Allah led this person astray after knowledge reached him and the proof was established before him. The second meaning includes the first meaning, but not the opposite. Allah said,\nوَخَتَمَ عَلَى سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَى بَصَرِهِ غِشَـوَةً\n(and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight.) so he does not hear what benefits him, understands not what would lead him to the guidance and sees not the evidence with which he can be enlightened. This is why Allah said,\nفَمَن يَهْدِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ اللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ\n(Who then will guide him after Allah Will you not then remember) Allah said in a similar Ayah,\nمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ\n(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.)

Allah said in another Ayah,\nلاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ\n(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) (59:20) Allah said here,\nأَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ\n(Or do those who earn evil deeds think) those who commit and practice evil,\nأَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَـهُمْ وَمَمَـتُهُمْ\n(that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their life and their death) treat them equally in the present life of the world and in the Hereafter\nسَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ\n(Worst is the judgement that they make.) `worst is the thought that they have about Us and about Our justice, thinking that We will ever make the pious and the wicked equal in the Hereafter or this life.' At--Tabarani recorded that Shu`bah said that `Amr bin Murrah narrated that Abu Ad-Duha said that Masruq said that Tamim Ad-Dari once stood in voluntary prayer through the night until the morning only reciting this Ayah,\nأَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds) Allah said in reply:\nسَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ\n(Worst is the judgement that they make.) Allah said,\nوَخَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth,) meaning, in justice,\nوَلِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.) Allah the Exalted said,\nأَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَـهَهُ هَوَاهُ\n(Have you seen him who takes his own lust as his god), who abides by his lust, and whatever his lust portrays as good he implements it, and whatever his lust portrays as evil, he abandons it! Allah's statement,\nوَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ\n(And Allah left him astray with knowledge, ) has two meanings. One of them is that Allah knew that this person deserves to be misguided, so He left him astray. The second meaning is that Allah led this person astray after knowledge reached him and the proof was established before him. The second meaning includes the first meaning, but not the opposite. Allah said,\nوَخَتَمَ عَلَى سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَى بَصَرِهِ غِشَـوَةً\n(and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight.) so he does not hear what benefits him, understands not what would lead him to the guidance and sees not the evidence with which he can be enlightened. This is why Allah said,\nفَمَن يَهْدِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ اللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ\n(Who then will guide him after Allah Will you not then remember) Allah said in a similar Ayah,\nمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ\n(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.)

This was also the statement of atheist philosophers who deny the Creator and think that the world will return to its original form once every thirty--six thousand years, when everything will restart its life--cycle again!

They said, \"During the time of Jahiliyyah, when an affliction, a calamity or a disaster struck them, the Arabs used to say, `Woe to Ad-Dahr (time)!' So they used to blame such incidents on Ad-Dahr, cursing Ad-Dahr in the process. Surely, it is Allah the Exalted and Most Honored Who causes these (and all) things to happen. This is why when they cursed Ad-Dahr, it was as if they were cursing Allah Himself, since truthfully, He causes all incidents to happen.

Allah said,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ\nThe Day when He will gather you (all) on the Day of Gathering. )64:9(,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of sorting out.) (77:12-13), and,\nوَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لاًّجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ\n(And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed.) (11:104) Allah said here,\nثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.) there is no doubt that it will come,\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(But most of mankind know not.) and this is why they deny Resurrection and discount the fact that the bodies will be brought back to life. Allah the Exalted said,\nإِنَّهُمْ يَرَوْنَهُ بَعِيداً - وَنَرَاهُ قَرِيباً\n(Verily, they see it afar off. But We see it (quite) near.) (70:6), they discount the possibility that Resurrection will ever come, while the believers believe that its occurrence is easy and imminent."

There are the angels, Jinns, humans, animals, birds, beasts, carnivores, insects and various kinds of sea creatures. The night and day alternate, each follows the other in succession, never ceasing to come, as decreed. One brings darkness and one brings light. Allah the Exalted also sends down the rain from the clouds when it is most needed. He is calling the rain, `provision', because it is the resource that produces various provisions,\nفَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا\n(and revives therewith the earth after its death,) after it was dry and had no vegetation or life of any kind. Allah said next,\nوَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ\n(and in the turning about of the winds,) sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north. Some are easterly winds and some are westerly winds, some bringing sea breezes and some blow from the land, some coming at night and some by day. Some winds bring rain, some cause pollination and some winds just revive the soul, while some others bear no benefit. Allah said first.\nلاّيَـتٍ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(are signs for the believers), then\nيُوقِنُونَ\n(who have faith with certainty), then\nيَعْقِلُونَ\n(who understand), thus ascending from one honorable stage to what is more honorable and higher in grade. These Ayat are similar to an Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah\nإِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَـحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that He has spread therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding.)

In the Sahih, it is reported that Allah the Exalted will ask some of His servants on the Day of Resurrection,\n«أَلَمْ أُزَوِّجْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ وَالْإِبِلَ، وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بَلَى يَارَبِّ. فَيَقُولُ: أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلَاقِيَّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا. فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: فَالْيَوْمَ أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي»\n(\"Have I not given you a spouse, honored you and subjected the camels and horses to you Have I not allowed you to be a chief and a master\" The servant will say in answer, \"Yes, O Lord!\" Allah will say, \"Did you think that you would ever meet Me\" He will say, \"No.\" Allah the Exalted will say, \"then this Day, I will forget you as you forgot Me.\") Allah the Exalted said,\nذَلِكُم بِأَنَّكُمُ اتَّخَذْتُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُواً\n(This, because you took the revelations of Allah in mockery.) `We gave you this punishment as retribution because you mocked Allah's proofs that He sent to you, and made them the subject of jokes and jest,'\nوَغَرَّتْكُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا\n(and the life of the world deceived you.) `this life fooled you and you were seduced by to it, thus becoming among the ultimate losers,'\nفَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يُخْرَجُونَ مِنْهَا\n(So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there), from Hellfire,\nوَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ\n(nor shall they be returned to the worldly life.) no apologies shall be sought from them, but they will be punished without limit or delay, just as a group of the believers will enter Paradise without limit or delay. After Allah mentioned His judgement for the believers and the disbelievers, He said,\nفَلِلَّهِ الْحَمْدُ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَرَبِّ الاٌّرْضِ\n(So all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth,) He is their Owner and the Owner of all that is in and on them, and surely,\nرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(and the Lord of all that exists.) Allah said next,\nوَلَهُ الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(And His is the majesty in the heavens and the earth, ) meaning, the kingship, according to Mujahid. This Ayah means, Allah is the Almighty, Worthy of all praise; everything and everyone is subservient and in complete need of and dependent upon Him. In an authentic Hadith, the Prophet said,\n«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا أَسْكَنْتُهُ نَارِي»\n(Allah the Exalted said, \"Glory is My robe and pride is My garment; whoever rivals Me for either of them, I will make him reside in My Fire!\") Muslim collected a similar Hadith. Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(and He is the Al-`Aziz,) Who is never resisted or rivaled,\nالْحَكِيمُ\n(Al-Hakim) all wise in His statements, actions, legislation and the decree that He appoints; all glory and praise are due to Him, none has the right to be worshipped but He, Alone. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jathiyah. All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone."
