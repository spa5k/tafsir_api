      "text": "The Virtues of Surat As-Saffat\nAn-Nasa'i recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to command us to make our prayers short and he used to recite As-Saffat when he lead us in prayer.\" This was recorded by An-Nasa'i only.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nIt was reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said:\nوَالصَّـفَّـتِ صَفَّا\n\"(By those ranged in ranks.) -- they are the angels;\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) they are the angels;\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.) they are the angels.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Masruq, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Qatadah said, \"The angels form ranks in the heavens.\" Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا، وَجُعِلَ لَنَا تُرَابُهَا طَهُورًا، إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء»\n(We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)\" Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»\n(Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:\n«يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْمُتَقَدِّمَةَ، وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّف»\n(They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )\" As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.) As-Suddi said, \"The angels bring the Scriptures and the Qur'an from Allah to mankind.\"\nThe One True God is Allah\nإِنَّ إِلَـهَكُمْ لَوَاحِدٌ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Verily, your God is indeed One, Lord of the heavens and the earth,) This is the One by Whom the oath is sworn, stating that there is no God worthy of worship but He, Lord of the heavens and the earth,\nوَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n(and all that is between them,) means, of created beings.\nوَرَبُّ الْمَشَـرِقِ\n(and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.) means, He is the Sovereign Who is controlling His creation by subjugating it and all that is in it of stars, planets and heavenly bodies which appear from the east and set in the west. Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:\nفَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَـدِرُونَ\n(So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.) (70:40)\nرَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ\n((He is) the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests. ) (55:17) which refers to the rising and setting points of the sun and the moon in both winter and summer."

      "text": "The Adornment and Protection of the Heaven comes from Allah\nAllah tells us that He has adorned the lowest heaven with the heavenly bodies for those among the people of the earth who look at it. The stars and planets in the sky give light to the people of earth, as Allah says:\nوَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) (67:5),\nوَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:\nوَحِفْظاً\n(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,\nمِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ\n(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:\nلاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى\n(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ\n(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:\nوَيَقْذِفُونَ\n(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,\nمِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ\n(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.\nدُحُوراً\n(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.\nوَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ\n(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:\nوَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah.\" -- Waki` said, \"This means in the valley of Nakhlah.\" -- \"They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.\"'"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah.

It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son!

He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first.

We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq.

Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first.

He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.

It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il.

It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first.

Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.

It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.

So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"

If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!)

Then Allah explain this further:\nسَلَـمٌ عَلَى مُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ إِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ إِنَّهُمَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(Salam (peace!) be upon Musa and Harun! Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good. Verily, they were two of Our believing servants.)\nوَإِنَّ إِلْيَاسَ لَمِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ - أَتَدْعُونَ بَعْلاً وَتَذَرُونَ أَحْسَنَ الْخَـلِقِينَ - اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ وَرَبَّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ إِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ"

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

      "text": "The Story of Yunus\nWe have already discussed the story of Yunus, peace be upon him, in Surat Al-Anbiya' (21:87-88). In the Two Sahihs it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا يَنْبَغِي لِعَبْدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى»\n(It is not right for any person to say I am better than Yunus bin Matta.)\nإِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ\n(When he ran to the laden ship.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"It was filled with cargo.\nفَسَـهَمَ\n(Then he (agreed to) cast lots,) means, to draw lots.\"\nفَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ\n(and he was among the losers.) means among those who have been overcome. This was because the ship was being pounded by the waves on all sides, and they were at risk of drowning, so they drew lots, and whoever lost would be thrown overboard so as to lighten the load. The Prophet of Allah Yunus, peace be upon him, lost the draw three times, but they did not want to throw him overboard. He took off his garment so that he could throw himself into the sea, and they tried to stop him. Then Allah commanded a large fish from the Green Sea (i.e., Mediterranian Sea) to cleave the oceans and come and swallow Yunus, peace be upon him, without cutting his flesh or breaking his bones. The fish came and Yunus, peace be upon him, threw himself overboard, and the fish swallowed him and took him away, traveling through all the seas with him. When Yunus had stayed for some time in the fish's belly, he thought that he had died; then he moved his head and legs and arms, and saw that he was alive. He prayed in the belly of the fish, and one of the things he said in his main prayer was: \"O Lord, I have taken as a place of worship to You a place which no other person has reached.\" They differed as to how long he spent in the belly of the fish. Some said three days; this was the view of Qatadah. Some said seven days; this was the view of Ja`far As-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him. Some said forty days; this was the view of Abu Malik. Mujahid said, narrating from Ash-Sha`bi, \"It swallowed him in the morning and cast him forth in the evening.\" And Allah knows best how long exactly was. Allah says,\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.) It was said that, if he had not already done righteous deeds during his time of ease. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah and others, and it was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. This is what is indicated in the authentic Hadith which we quote below, if Allah wills. In a Hadith narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:\n«تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى اللهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ، يَعْرِفْكَ فِي الشِّدَّة»\n(Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of difficulty.) And it was said that what was meant by the Ayah:\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,) was the meaning of the following Ayat:\nفَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(But he cried through the darkness (saying): \"La ilaha illa Anta, You are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:87-88). This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and others. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" This call went and hovered around the (mighty) Throne, and the angels said, \"O Lord, this is the voice of one who is weak but known, in a faraway strange land. Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"How do you know this\" They said, \"O Lord, who is he\" Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"My servant Yunus.\" They said, \"Your servant Yunus, from whom there kept coming acceptable deeds and supplications which were answered!\" They said, \"O Lord, will You not have mercy on him for what he did during his time of ease, and save him from this trial and tribulation\" He said, \"Of course.\" So, He commanded the great fish, and it cast him forth on the naked shore.) Allah says:\nفَنَبَذْنَـهُ\n(But We cast him forth) meaning, `We threw him out,'\nبِالْعَرَآءِ\n(on the naked shore) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said that this refers to land in which there is no vegetation and no buildings.\nوَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ\n(while he was sick,) means, when he was weak of body.\nوَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ\n(And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.) Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Hilal bin Yasaf, `Abdullah bin Tawus, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others, all said that gourd means squash. Some of them mentioned that the squash has a number of benefits: it grows quickly, its leaves offer shade because of their large size and smooth texture, flies do not come near it, and its fruits provide good nourishment; they may be eaten raw or cooked, and both the pulp and the peel may be eaten. It was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to like squash and would look for it wherever it was on the serving dish.\nوَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.) It is as if he was commanded, after he came forth from the fish, to go back to those to whom he had been sent in the first place, and they all believed in him.\nأَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(or even more.) Makhul said, \"They numbered one hundred and ten thousand. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of Arabic, the people of Basrah, said that this means up to one hundred thousand or more.\" Ibn Jarir interpreted this Ayah as he interpreted the Ayat:\nثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً\n(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74).\nإِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً\n(Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), and\nفَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى\n(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

      "text": "The Story of Yunus\nWe have already discussed the story of Yunus, peace be upon him, in Surat Al-Anbiya' (21:87-88). In the Two Sahihs it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا يَنْبَغِي لِعَبْدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى»\n(It is not right for any person to say I am better than Yunus bin Matta.)\nإِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ\n(When he ran to the laden ship.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"It was filled with cargo.\nفَسَـهَمَ\n(Then he (agreed to) cast lots,) means, to draw lots.\"\nفَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ\n(and he was among the losers.) means among those who have been overcome. This was because the ship was being pounded by the waves on all sides, and they were at risk of drowning, so they drew lots, and whoever lost would be thrown overboard so as to lighten the load. The Prophet of Allah Yunus, peace be upon him, lost the draw three times, but they did not want to throw him overboard. He took off his garment so that he could throw himself into the sea, and they tried to stop him. Then Allah commanded a large fish from the Green Sea (i.e., Mediterranian Sea) to cleave the oceans and come and swallow Yunus, peace be upon him, without cutting his flesh or breaking his bones. The fish came and Yunus, peace be upon him, threw himself overboard, and the fish swallowed him and took him away, traveling through all the seas with him. When Yunus had stayed for some time in the fish's belly, he thought that he had died; then he moved his head and legs and arms, and saw that he was alive. He prayed in the belly of the fish, and one of the things he said in his main prayer was: \"O Lord, I have taken as a place of worship to You a place which no other person has reached.\" They differed as to how long he spent in the belly of the fish. Some said three days; this was the view of Qatadah. Some said seven days; this was the view of Ja`far As-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him. Some said forty days; this was the view of Abu Malik. Mujahid said, narrating from Ash-Sha`bi, \"It swallowed him in the morning and cast him forth in the evening.\" And Allah knows best how long exactly was. Allah says,\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.) It was said that, if he had not already done righteous deeds during his time of ease. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah and others, and it was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. This is what is indicated in the authentic Hadith which we quote below, if Allah wills. In a Hadith narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:\n«تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى اللهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ، يَعْرِفْكَ فِي الشِّدَّة»\n(Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of difficulty.) And it was said that what was meant by the Ayah:\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,) was the meaning of the following Ayat:\nفَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(But he cried through the darkness (saying): \"La ilaha illa Anta, You are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:87-88). This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and others. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" This call went and hovered around the (mighty) Throne, and the angels said, \"O Lord, this is the voice of one who is weak but known, in a faraway strange land. Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"How do you know this\" They said, \"O Lord, who is he\" Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"My servant Yunus.\" They said, \"Your servant Yunus, from whom there kept coming acceptable deeds and supplications which were answered!\" They said, \"O Lord, will You not have mercy on him for what he did during his time of ease, and save him from this trial and tribulation\" He said, \"Of course.\" So, He commanded the great fish, and it cast him forth on the naked shore.) Allah says:\nفَنَبَذْنَـهُ\n(But We cast him forth) meaning, `We threw him out,'\nبِالْعَرَآءِ\n(on the naked shore) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said that this refers to land in which there is no vegetation and no buildings.\nوَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ\n(while he was sick,) means, when he was weak of body.\nوَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ\n(And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.) Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Hilal bin Yasaf, `Abdullah bin Tawus, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others, all said that gourd means squash. Some of them mentioned that the squash has a number of benefits: it grows quickly, its leaves offer shade because of their large size and smooth texture, flies do not come near it, and its fruits provide good nourishment; they may be eaten raw or cooked, and both the pulp and the peel may be eaten. It was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to like squash and would look for it wherever it was on the serving dish.\nوَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.) It is as if he was commanded, after he came forth from the fish, to go back to those to whom he had been sent in the first place, and they all believed in him.\nأَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(or even more.) Makhul said, \"They numbered one hundred and ten thousand. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of Arabic, the people of Basrah, said that this means up to one hundred thousand or more.\" Ibn Jarir interpreted this Ayah as he interpreted the Ayat:\nثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً\n(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74).\nإِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً\n(Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), and\nفَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى\n(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"It was filled with cargo.\nفَسَـهَمَ\n(Then he (agreed to) cast lots,) means, to draw lots.\"\nفَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ\n(and he was among the losers.) means among those who have been overcome. This was because the ship was being pounded by the waves on all sides, and they were at risk of drowning, so they drew lots, and whoever lost would be thrown overboard so as to lighten the load. The Prophet of Allah Yunus, peace be upon him, lost the draw three times, but they did not want to throw him overboard. He took off his garment so that he could throw himself into the sea, and they tried to stop him. Then Allah commanded a large fish from the Green Sea (i.e., Mediterranian Sea) to cleave the oceans and come and swallow Yunus, peace be upon him, without cutting his flesh or breaking his bones. The fish came and Yunus, peace be upon him, threw himself overboard, and the fish swallowed him and took him away, traveling through all the seas with him. When Yunus had stayed for some time in the fish's belly, he thought that he had died; then he moved his head and legs and arms, and saw that he was alive. He prayed in the belly of the fish, and one of the things he said in his main prayer was: \"O Lord, I have taken as a place of worship to You a place which no other person has reached.\" They differed as to how long he spent in the belly of the fish. Some said three days; this was the view of Qatadah. Some said seven days; this was the view of Ja`far As-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him. Some said forty days; this was the view of Abu Malik. Mujahid said, narrating from Ash-Sha`bi, \"It swallowed him in the morning and cast him forth in the evening.\" And Allah knows best how long exactly was. Allah says,\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.) It was said that, if he had not already done righteous deeds during his time of ease. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah and others, and it was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. This is what is indicated in the authentic Hadith which we quote below, if Allah wills. In a Hadith narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:\n«تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى اللهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ، يَعْرِفْكَ فِي الشِّدَّة»\n(Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of difficulty.) And it was said that what was meant by the Ayah:\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,) was the meaning of the following Ayat:\nفَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(But he cried through the darkness (saying): \"La ilaha illa Anta, You are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:87-88). This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and others. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" This call went and hovered around the (mighty) Throne, and the angels said, \"O Lord, this is the voice of one who is weak but known, in a faraway strange land. Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"How do you know this\" They said, \"O Lord, who is he\" Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"My servant Yunus.\" They said, \"Your servant Yunus, from whom there kept coming acceptable deeds and supplications which were answered!\" They said, \"O Lord, will You not have mercy on him for what he did during his time of ease, and save him from this trial and tribulation\" He said, \"Of course.\" So, He commanded the great fish, and it cast him forth on the naked shore.) Allah says:\nفَنَبَذْنَـهُ\n(But We cast him forth) meaning, `We threw him out,'\nبِالْعَرَآءِ\n(on the naked shore) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said that this refers to land in which there is no vegetation and no buildings.\nوَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ\n(while he was sick,) means, when he was weak of body.\nوَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ\n(And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.) Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Hilal bin Yasaf, `Abdullah bin Tawus, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others, all said that gourd means squash. Some of them mentioned that the squash has a number of benefits: it grows quickly, its leaves offer shade because of their large size and smooth texture, flies do not come near it, and its fruits provide good nourishment; they may be eaten raw or cooked, and both the pulp and the peel may be eaten. It was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to like squash and would look for it wherever it was on the serving dish.\nوَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.) It is as if he was commanded, after he came forth from the fish, to go back to those to whom he had been sent in the first place, and they all believed in him.\nأَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(or even more.) Makhul said, \"They numbered one hundred and ten thousand. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of Arabic, the people of Basrah, said that this means up to one hundred thousand or more.\" Ibn Jarir interpreted this Ayah as he interpreted the Ayat:\nثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً\n(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74).\nإِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً\n(Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), and\nفَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى\n(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" This call went and hovered around the (mighty) Throne, and the angels said, \"O Lord, this is the voice of one who is weak but known, in a faraway strange land. Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"How do you know this\" They said, \"O Lord, who is he\" Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"My servant Yunus.\" They said, \"Your servant Yunus, from whom there kept coming acceptable deeds and supplications which were answered!\" They said, \"O Lord, will You not have mercy on him for what he did during his time of ease, and save him from this trial and tribulation\" He said, \"Of course.\" So, He commanded the great fish, and it cast him forth on the naked shore.) Allah says:\nفَنَبَذْنَـهُ\n(But We cast him forth) meaning, `We threw him out,'\nبِالْعَرَآءِ\n(on the naked shore) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said that this refers to land in which there is no vegetation and no buildings.\nوَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ\n(while he was sick,) means, when he was weak of body.\nوَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ\n(And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.) Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Hilal bin Yasaf, `Abdullah bin Tawus, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others, all said that gourd means squash. Some of them mentioned that the squash has a number of benefits: it grows quickly, its leaves offer shade because of their large size and smooth texture, flies do not come near it, and its fruits provide good nourishment; they may be eaten raw or cooked, and both the pulp and the peel may be eaten. It was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to like squash and would look for it wherever it was on the serving dish.\nوَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.) It is as if he was commanded, after he came forth from the fish, to go back to those to whom he had been sent in the first place, and they all believed in him.\nأَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(or even more.) Makhul said, \"They numbered one hundred and ten thousand. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of Arabic, the people of Basrah, said that this means up to one hundred thousand or more.\" Ibn Jarir interpreted this Ayah as he interpreted the Ayat:\nثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً\n(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74).\nإِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً\n(Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), and\nفَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى\n(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

      "text": "The Story of Yunus\nWe have already discussed the story of Yunus, peace be upon him, in Surat Al-Anbiya' (21:87-88). In the Two Sahihs it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا يَنْبَغِي لِعَبْدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى»\n(It is not right for any person to say I am better than Yunus bin Matta.)\nإِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ\n(When he ran to the laden ship.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"It was filled with cargo.\nفَسَـهَمَ\n(Then he (agreed to) cast lots,) means, to draw lots.\"\nفَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ\n(and he was among the losers.) means among those who have been overcome. This was because the ship was being pounded by the waves on all sides, and they were at risk of drowning, so they drew lots, and whoever lost would be thrown overboard so as to lighten the load. The Prophet of Allah Yunus, peace be upon him, lost the draw three times, but they did not want to throw him overboard. He took off his garment so that he could throw himself into the sea, and they tried to stop him. Then Allah commanded a large fish from the Green Sea (i.e., Mediterranian Sea) to cleave the oceans and come and swallow Yunus, peace be upon him, without cutting his flesh or breaking his bones. The fish came and Yunus, peace be upon him, threw himself overboard, and the fish swallowed him and took him away, traveling through all the seas with him. When Yunus had stayed for some time in the fish's belly, he thought that he had died; then he moved his head and legs and arms, and saw that he was alive. He prayed in the belly of the fish, and one of the things he said in his main prayer was: \"O Lord, I have taken as a place of worship to You a place which no other person has reached.\" They differed as to how long he spent in the belly of the fish. Some said three days; this was the view of Qatadah. Some said seven days; this was the view of Ja`far As-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him. Some said forty days; this was the view of Abu Malik. Mujahid said, narrating from Ash-Sha`bi, \"It swallowed him in the morning and cast him forth in the evening.\" And Allah knows best how long exactly was. Allah says,\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.) It was said that, if he had not already done righteous deeds during his time of ease. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah and others, and it was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. This is what is indicated in the authentic Hadith which we quote below, if Allah wills. In a Hadith narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:\n«تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى اللهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ، يَعْرِفْكَ فِي الشِّدَّة»\n(Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of difficulty.) And it was said that what was meant by the Ayah:\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,) was the meaning of the following Ayat:\nفَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(But he cried through the darkness (saying): \"La ilaha illa Anta, You are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:87-88). This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and others. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified!

Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of Arabic, the people of Basrah, said that this means up to one hundred thousand or more.\" Ibn Jarir interpreted this Ayah as he interpreted the Ayat:\nثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً\n(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74).\nإِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً\n(Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), and\nفَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى\n(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

      "text": "The Story of Yunus\nWe have already discussed the story of Yunus, peace be upon him, in Surat Al-Anbiya' (21:87-88). In the Two Sahihs it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا يَنْبَغِي لِعَبْدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى»\n(It is not right for any person to say I am better than Yunus bin Matta.)\nإِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ\n(When he ran to the laden ship.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"It was filled with cargo.\nفَسَـهَمَ\n(Then he (agreed to) cast lots,) means, to draw lots.\"\nفَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ\n(and he was among the losers.) means among those who have been overcome. This was because the ship was being pounded by the waves on all sides, and they were at risk of drowning, so they drew lots, and whoever lost would be thrown overboard so as to lighten the load. The Prophet of Allah Yunus, peace be upon him, lost the draw three times, but they did not want to throw him overboard. He took off his garment so that he could throw himself into the sea, and they tried to stop him. Then Allah commanded a large fish from the Green Sea (i.e., Mediterranian Sea) to cleave the oceans and come and swallow Yunus, peace be upon him, without cutting his flesh or breaking his bones. The fish came and Yunus, peace be upon him, threw himself overboard, and the fish swallowed him and took him away, traveling through all the seas with him. When Yunus had stayed for some time in the fish's belly, he thought that he had died; then he moved his head and legs and arms, and saw that he was alive. He prayed in the belly of the fish, and one of the things he said in his main prayer was: \"O Lord, I have taken as a place of worship to You a place which no other person has reached.\" They differed as to how long he spent in the belly of the fish. Some said three days; this was the view of Qatadah. Some said seven days; this was the view of Ja`far As-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him. Some said forty days; this was the view of Abu Malik. Mujahid said, narrating from Ash-Sha`bi, \"It swallowed him in the morning and cast him forth in the evening.\" And Allah knows best how long exactly was. Allah says,\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.) It was said that, if he had not already done righteous deeds during his time of ease. This was the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah and others, and it was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. This is what is indicated in the authentic Hadith which we quote below, if Allah wills. In a Hadith narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:\n«تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى اللهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ، يَعْرِفْكَ فِي الشِّدَّة»\n(Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of difficulty.) And it was said that what was meant by the Ayah:\nفَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ\n(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,) was the meaning of the following Ayat:\nفَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(But he cried through the darkness (saying): \"La ilaha illa Anta, You are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:87-88). This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and others. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him -- and I do not know of anything narrated from Anas that he did not attribute to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:\n«إِنَّ يُونُسَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ حِينَ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَدْعُوَ بِهَذِهِ الْكَلِمَاتِ وَهُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ فَقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ،فَأَقْبَلَتِ الدَّعْوَةُ تَحُفُّ بِالْعَرْشِ، قَالَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ: يَا رَبِّ هَذَا صَوْتٌ ضَعِيفٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مِنْ بِلَادٍ بَعِيدَةٍ غَرِيبَةٍ فَقَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَمَا تَعْرِفُونَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْ هُوَ؟ قَالَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: عَبْدِي يُونُسُ، قَالُوا: عَبْدُكَ يُونُسُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَزَلْ يُرْفَعُ لَهُ عَمَلٌ مُتَقَبَّلٌ وَدَعْوَةٌ مُسْتَجَابَةٌ؟ قَالُوا: يَا رَبِّ أَوَلَا تَرْحَمُ مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِي الرَّخَاءِ فَتُنْجِيَهُ فِي الْبَلَاءِ، قَالَ: بَلَى، فَأَمَرَ الْحُوتَ فَطَرَحَهُ بِالْعَرَاء»\n(When it occurred to the Prophet Yunus, upon him be peace, to call upon Allah in these words when he was in the belly of the great fish, he said, \"La ilaha illa Anta, Yo are glorified! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\" This call went and hovered around the (mighty) Throne, and the angels said, \"O Lord, this is the voice of one who is weak but known, in a faraway strange land. Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"How do you know this\" They said, \"O Lord, who is he\" Allah, may He be exalted, said, \"My servant Yunus.\" They said, \"Your servant Yunus, from whom there kept coming acceptable deeds and supplications which were answered!\" They said, \"O Lord, will You not have mercy on him for what he did during his time of ease, and save him from this trial and tribulation\" He said, \"Of course.\" So, He commanded the great fish, and it cast him forth on the naked shore.) Allah says:\nفَنَبَذْنَـهُ\n(But We cast him forth) meaning, `We threw him out,'\nبِالْعَرَآءِ\n(on the naked shore) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said that this refers to land in which there is no vegetation and no buildings.\nوَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ\n(while he was sick,) means, when he was weak of body.\nوَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ\n(And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.) Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Hilal bin Yasaf, `Abdullah bin Tawus, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and several others, all said that gourd means squash. Some of them mentioned that the squash has a number of benefits: it grows quickly, its leaves offer shade because of their large size and smooth texture, flies do not come near it, and its fruits provide good nourishment; they may be eaten raw or cooked, and both the pulp and the peel may be eaten. It was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to like squash and would look for it wherever it was on the serving dish.\nوَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.) It is as if he was commanded, after he came forth from the fish, to go back to those to whom he had been sent in the first place, and they all believed in him.\nأَوْ يَزِيدُونَ\n(or even more.)

The meaning is, not less than that, but rather more.\nفَـَامِنُواْ\n(And they believed;) means, these people to whom Yunus, peace be upon him, had been sent all believed.\nفَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(so We gave them enjoyment for a while. ) means, until the time of their appointed end. This is like the Ayah,\nفَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Was there any town (community) that believed, and its faith (at that moment) saved it -- except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) (10:98)\nفَاسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ الْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ الْبَنُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقْنَا الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِنَـثاً وَهُمْ شَـهِدُونَ - أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ - وَلَدَ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ - أَصْطَفَى الْبَنَاتِ عَلَى الْبَنِينَ مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَـنٌ مُّبِينٌ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ"

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

(He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!) means, exalted, sanctified and glorified be He far above having any offspring and far above what the wrongdoers and heretics attribute to Him.\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Except the servants of Allah, whom He chooses.) The pronoun in the verb translated as \"they attribute\" refers to all of mankind, then He excludes those whom He chooses, who are the ones who follow the truth revealed to every Prophet who was sent.\nفَإِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ - مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَـتِنِينَ - إِلاَّ مَنْ هُوَ صَالِ الْجَحِيمِ - وَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ - وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الصَّآفُّونَ - وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْمُسَبِّحُونَ - وَإِن كَانُواْ لَيَقُولُونَ - لَوْ أَنَّ عِندَنَا ذِكْراً مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ"

      "text": "The Certainty of Life after Death\nAllah says: `Ask these people, those who deny the resurrection, which is harder to create Are they more difficult to create or the heavens, the earth, the angels, devils, the mighty creatures -- everything in between them' Ibn Mas`ud said that they admitted that these things were harder to create than they were. If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

      "text": "No One believes what the Idolators say except Those Who are even more misguided than They\nAllah says, addressing the idolators:\nفَإِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ - مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَـتِنِينَ - إِلاَّ مَنْ هُوَ صَالِ الْجَحِيمِ\n(So, verily you and those whom you worship cannot lead astray, except those who are predestined to burn in Hell!) meaning, `the only ones who will believe what you say and follow your misguided ways of false worship are those who are more misguided than you and are created for Hell.'\nلَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ ءَاذَانٌ لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَآ أُوْلَـئِكَ كَالأَنْعَـمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْغَـفِلُونَ\n(They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.) (7:179). This is the parable of the people who follow the belief and ideas of Shirk, disbelief and misguidance, as Allah says:\nإِنَّكُمْ لَفِى قَوْلٍ مُّخْتَلِفٍ - يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ\n(Certainly, you have different ideas. Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside (by the decree of Allah).) (51:8-9) meaning, the one who is misled by it is the one who is turned aside.\nThe Place of the Angels and Their Ranks glorify Allah\nThen Allah says, declaring the angels to be above the position attributed to them by those who disbelieved in them and told lies about them -- that they are the daughters of Allah --\nوَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place;) meaning, each one has his own place in the heavens and in the places of worship, which he does not overstep. Ad-Dahhak said in his Tafsir:\nوَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n\"(And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place;) Masruq used to narrate that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا مَوْضِعٌ إِلَّا عَلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ سَاجِدٌ أَوْ قَائِم»\n(There is no place in the lower heaven without an angel standing or prostrating in it.) This is what Allah says:\nوَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place (or position)).\" It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"In the heavens there is one heaven in which there is no space a hand span wide but there is the forehead or the foot of an angel on it. \" Then he recited:\nوَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place;) Sa`id bin Jubayr similarly said:\nوَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الصَّآفُّونَ\n(And we (angels), we stand in rows.) means, we stand in rows to worship, as we have already seen in the Ayah\nوَالصَّـفَّـتِ صَفَّا\n(By those ranged in ranks (or rows)) Abu Nadrah said, \"When the Iqamah had been given, `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, would turn to face the people and say: `Make your rows straight, for Allah wants you to follow the ways of the angels.' Then he would say,\nوَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الصَّآفُّونَ\n(And verily, we stand in rows;) `Move back, O so-and-so, move forward, O so-and-so.' Then he would go forward and say `Allahu Akbar\"' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. In Sahih Muslim it is narrated that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ،وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ مَسْجِدًا، وَتُرْبَتُهَا طَهُورًا»\n(We have been favored above mankind in three things: our rows have been made like the rows of the angels; the whole earth has been made a place of prayer for us; and its soil is a means of purification for us.)\"\nوَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْمُسَبِّحُونَ\n(And verily, we indeed are those who glorify.) means, `we stand in rows and glorify the Lord, praising Him, sanctifying Him and declaring Him to be above any faults or shortcomings. We are servants of Him and in need of Him, humbling ourselves before Him.'\nThe Quraysh wished that They could have a Reminder as had the Men of old\nوَإِن كَانُواْ لَيَقُولُونَ - لَوْ أَنَّ عِندَنَا ذِكْراً مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\nلَكُنَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ-\n(And indeed they used to say: \"If we had a reminder as had the men of old, we would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah!\") means, `they used to wish -- before you, O Muhammad, came to them -- that they would have someone to remind them about Allah and what happened in earlier times, and to bring them the Book of Allah.' This is like the Ayat:\nوَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ مَّا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ نُفُوراً\n(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them); yet when a warner came to them, it increased in them naught but flight (from the truth).) (35:42), and\nأَن تَقُولُواْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ الْكِتَـبُ عَلَى طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَـفِلِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَـبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَـتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا سَنَجْزِى الَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ آيَـتِنَا سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ\n(Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a form of guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and turns away therefrom We shall requite those who turn away from Our Ayat with an evil torment, because of their turning away.) (6:156-157) Allah says here:\nفَكَفَرُواْ بِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(But they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know!) This is a definite and stern threat because of their disbelief in their Lord and their rejection of His Messenger .\nوَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ - فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّى حِينٍ - وَأَبْصِرْهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يُبْصِرُونَ أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ فَإِذَا نَزَلَ بِسَاحَتِهِمْ فَسَآءَ صَبَاحُ الْمُنْذَرِينَ وَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّى حِينٍ"

If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:\nإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُم مِّن طِينٍ لاَّزِبٍ\n(Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, \"It is sticky and useful.\" Qatadah said, \"It is that which sticks to the hand.\"\nبَلْ عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخُرُونَ\n(Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, \"Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.\"\nوَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ ءَايَةً\n(And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,\nيَسْتَسْخِرُونَ\n(they mock at it.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, \"They make fun of it.\"\nوَقَالُواْ إِن هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And they say: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") means, `this that you have brought is nothing but plain magic.'\nأَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ - أَوَ ءَابَآؤُنَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected And also our fathers of old) They thought that this was unlikely to happen, and they did not believe it.\nقُلْ نَعَمْ وَأَنتُمْ دَخِرُونَ\n(Say: \"Yes, and you shall then be humiliated\".) means, `tell them, O Muhammad: Yes, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, after you have become dust and bones, and you will be humiliated,' i.e., put to shame before His great might. This is like the Ayat:\nوَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ\n(And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ\n(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) (40:60) Then Allah says:\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ\n(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) means, it will be a single command from Allah, He will call them once to come forth from the earth, then they will be standing before Him, staring at the horrors of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah knows best."

Qatadah said, \"The angels form ranks in the heavens.\" Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا، وَجُعِلَ لَنَا تُرَابُهَا طَهُورًا، إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء»\n(We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)\" Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»\n(Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:\n«يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْمُتَقَدِّمَةَ، وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّف»\n(They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )\" As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.)

Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:\nفَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَـدِرُونَ\n(So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.)

This is like the Ayah:\nوَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا\n(and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire) (17:97).\nوَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ مَّسْئُولُونَ\n(But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned.) means, stop them so that they may be questioned about the things they did and said in this world. As Ad-Dahhak said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, this means, `detain them, for they are to be brought to account.' `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, \"I heard `Uthman bin Za'idah say, `The first thing about which a man will be asked is the company that he kept. Then by way of rebuke, it will be said to them:\nمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنَـصَرُونَ\n(What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another).\"' meaning, `as you claimed that you would all help one another.'\nبَلْ هُمُ الْيَوْمَ مُسْتَسْلِمُونَ\n(Nay, but that Day they shall surrender.) means, they will be subjected to the command of Allah, and they will not be able to resist it or avoid it. And Allah knows best."

Qatadah said, \"The angels form ranks in the heavens.\" Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا، وَجُعِلَ لَنَا تُرَابُهَا طَهُورًا، إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء»\n(We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)\" Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»\n(Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:\n«يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْمُتَقَدِّمَةَ، وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّف»\n(They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )\" As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.) As-Suddi said, \"The angels bring the Scriptures and the Qur'an from Allah to mankind.\"\nThe One True God is Allah\nإِنَّ إِلَـهَكُمْ لَوَاحِدٌ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Verily, your God is indeed One, Lord of the heavens and the earth,) This is the One by Whom the oath is sworn, stating that there is no God worthy of worship but He, Lord of the heavens and the earth,\nوَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n(and all that is between them,) means, of created beings.\nوَرَبُّ الْمَشَـرِقِ\n(and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.) means, He is the Sovereign Who is controlling His creation by subjugating it and all that is in it of stars, planets and heavenly bodies which appear from the east and set in the west. Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:\nفَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَـدِرُونَ\n(So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.)

Allah said in refutation of their attitude:\nبَلْ جَآءَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Nay! he has come with the truth) meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has brought the truth with all that Allah has revealed to him of stories and commandments.\nوَصَدَّقَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(and he confirms the Messengers.) means, he fulfills their prophecies of his praiseworthy characteristics and his perfect way, and he tells people of the Laws and commands of Allah, as they said he would.\nمَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ\n(Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you) (41:43)."

Allah said in refutation of their attitude:\nبَلْ جَآءَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Nay! he has come with the truth) meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has brought the truth with all that Allah has revealed to him of stories and commandments.\nوَصَدَّقَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(and he confirms the Messengers.) means, he fulfills their prophecies of his praiseworthy characteristics and his perfect way, and he tells people of the Laws and commands of Allah, as they said he would.\nمَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ\n(Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you) (41:43)."

And (they) said: \"Are we going to abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet\") meaning, `Shall we stop worshipping our gods and the gods of our forefathers just because of the words of this mad poet' -- meaning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Allah said in refutation of their attitude:\nبَلْ جَآءَ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Nay! he has come with the truth) meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has brought the truth with all that Allah has revealed to him of stories and commandments.\nوَصَدَّقَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(and he confirms the Messengers.) means, he fulfills their prophecies of his praiseworthy characteristics and his perfect way, and he tells people of the Laws and commands of Allah, as they said he would.\nمَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ\n(Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you) (41:43)."

      "text": "The Punishment of the Idolators and the Reward of the sincere Believers\nAllah says, addressing the people:\nإِنَّكُمْ لَذَآئِقُو الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمِ - وَمَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(Verily, you are going to taste the painful torment; and you will be requited nothing except for what you used to do.) Then He makes an exception in the case of His sincerely believing servants. This is like the Ayat:\nوَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(By the Time.

(103:1-3),\nلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ فِى أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ - ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَـهُ أَسْفَلَ سَـفِلِينَ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Verily, We created man in the best stature. Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low. Save those who believe and do righteous deeds) (95:4-6).\nوَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا كَانَ عَلَى رَبِّكَ حَتْماً مَّقْضِيّاً - ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً\n(There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished. Then We shall save those who have Taqwa. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein to their knees.) (19:71-72); and\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ\ng(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the right) (74:38-39). Allah says here:\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Save the chosen servants of Allah.) meaning, they will not taste the painful torment nor will they be brought to account. Their evil acts, if there are any, will be overlooked, and each good deed will be rewarded in multiples of between ten and seven hundred, or as much as Allah wills.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ رِزْقٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(For them there will be a known provision,) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"This means Paradise.\" It is explained further in the next Ayah:\nفَوَكِهُ\n(Fruits) meaning, of different kinds.\nوَهُم مُّكْرَمُونَ\n(and they shall be honored,) means, they will be served and will live a life of luxury.\nفِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ - عَلَى سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَـبِلِينَ\n(In the Gardens of Delight, facing one another on thrones.) Mujahid said, \"One of them will not look at one another's backs.\"\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine -- white, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) This is like the Ayah:\nيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ - بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Immortal boys will go around them (serving), with cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine, from which they will get neither any aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:17-19). Allah refined the wine of Paradise from the bad effects of the wine of this world, which causes headaches and stomach aches -- which is the meaning of Ghawl -- causing people to lose their minds completely. So He says here:\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine) meaning, wine from a flowing stream which they do not fear will ever be cut off or cease. Malik narrated that Zayd bin Aslam said, \"White flowing wine,\" meaning, with a bright, shining color, unlike the wine of this earth with its ugly, repulsive colors of red, black, yellow and turbid shades, and other features which are repugnant to anyone of a sound nature.\nلَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ\n(delicious to the drinkers.) means, its taste will be as good as its color, and a good taste indicates that it has a good smell, unlike the wine of this world.\nلاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ\n(Neither will they have Ghawl from that) means, it will not have any effects on them such as causing stomach aches. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. This is unlike the wine of this world, which causes colic and so on, because it is too watery.\nوَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) Mujahid said, \"It will not cause them to lose their minds.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan. `Ata' bin Abi Muslim Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and others. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, \"Wine causes four things: intoxication, headache, vomiting and urine.\" So, when Allah mentions the wine of Paradise, He states that it is free of these characteristics, as mentioned in Surat As-Saffat.\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf) means, chaste females, who will not look at anyone other than their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said.\nعِينٌ\n(with (wide and beautiful) eyes) means, with beautiful eyes. It was also said that it means with wide eyes, which is connected to the first meaning. They are wide-eyed and beautiful, and their eyes are described as being beautiful and chaste. Allah says:\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ عِينٌ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf, with (wide and beautiful) eyes.)\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) Their bodies are described as having the most perfect color. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, as if they were hidden pearls. Al-Hasan said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun. ) means, protected, never touched by any hands. As-Suddi said, \"The well preserved egg in its nest.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The inside of the egg.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It is the membrane which is between its outer shell and its inner contents.\" As-Suddi said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The white of the egg when its shell is removed.\" Ibn Jarir's view concerning the meaning of Maknun (well preserved) is that the outer shell is touched by the wing of the bird and the nest, and by people's hands, unlike the interior of the egg. And Allah knows best."

Their evil acts, if there are any, will be overlooked, and each good deed will be rewarded in multiples of between ten and seven hundred, or as much as Allah wills.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ رِزْقٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(For them there will be a known provision,) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"This means Paradise.\" It is explained further in the next Ayah:\nفَوَكِهُ\n(Fruits) meaning, of different kinds.\nوَهُم مُّكْرَمُونَ\n(and they shall be honored,) means, they will be served and will live a life of luxury.\nفِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ - عَلَى سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَـبِلِينَ\n(In the Gardens of Delight, facing one another on thrones.) Mujahid said, \"One of them will not look at one another's backs.\"\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine -- white, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) This is like the Ayah:\nيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ - بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Immortal boys will go around them (serving), with cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine, from which they will get neither any aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:17-19). Allah refined the wine of Paradise from the bad effects of the wine of this world, which causes headaches and stomach aches -- which is the meaning of Ghawl -- causing people to lose their minds completely. So He says here:\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine) meaning, wine from a flowing stream which they do not fear will ever be cut off or cease.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. This is unlike the wine of this world, which causes colic and so on, because it is too watery.\nوَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) Mujahid said, \"It will not cause them to lose their minds.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan. `Ata' bin Abi Muslim Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and others. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, \"Wine causes four things: intoxication, headache, vomiting and urine.\" So, when Allah mentions the wine of Paradise, He states that it is free of these characteristics, as mentioned in Surat As-Saffat.\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf) means, chaste females, who will not look at anyone other than their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said.\nعِينٌ\n(with (wide and beautiful) eyes) means, with beautiful eyes. It was also said that it means with wide eyes, which is connected to the first meaning. They are wide-eyed and beautiful, and their eyes are described as being beautiful and chaste. Allah says:\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ عِينٌ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf, with (wide and beautiful) eyes.)\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) Their bodies are described as having the most perfect color. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, as if they were hidden pearls. Al-Hasan said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun. ) means, protected, never touched by any hands. As-Suddi said, \"The well preserved egg in its nest.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The inside of the egg.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It is the membrane which is between its outer shell and its inner contents.\" As-Suddi said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The white of the egg when its shell is removed.\" Ibn Jarir's view concerning the meaning of Maknun (well preserved) is that the outer shell is touched by the wing of the bird and the nest, and by people's hands, unlike the interior of the egg.

Qatadah said, \"The angels form ranks in the heavens.\" Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا، وَجُعِلَ لَنَا تُرَابُهَا طَهُورًا، إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء»\n(We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)\" Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»\n(Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:\n«يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْمُتَقَدِّمَةَ، وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّف»\n(They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )\" As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.) As-Suddi said, \"The angels bring the Scriptures and the Qur'an from Allah to mankind.\"\nThe One True God is Allah\nإِنَّ إِلَـهَكُمْ لَوَاحِدٌ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Verily, your God is indeed One, Lord of the heavens and the earth,) This is the One by Whom the oath is sworn, stating that there is no God worthy of worship but He, Lord of the heavens and the earth,\nوَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n(and all that is between them,) means, of created beings.\nوَرَبُّ الْمَشَـرِقِ\n(and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.) means, He is the Sovereign Who is controlling His creation by subjugating it and all that is in it of stars, planets and heavenly bodies which appear from the east and set in the west. Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:\nفَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَـدِرُونَ\n(So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.) (70:40)\nرَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ\n((He is) the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests. ) (55:17) which refers to the rising and setting points of the sun and the moon in both winter and summer."

Save those who believe and do righteous deeds) (95:4-6).\nوَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا كَانَ عَلَى رَبِّكَ حَتْماً مَّقْضِيّاً - ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً\n(There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished. Then We shall save those who have Taqwa. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein to their knees.) (19:71-72); and\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ\ng(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the right) (74:38-39). Allah says here:\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Save the chosen servants of Allah.) meaning, they will not taste the painful torment nor will they be brought to account. Their evil acts, if there are any, will be overlooked, and each good deed will be rewarded in multiples of between ten and seven hundred, or as much as Allah wills.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ رِزْقٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(For them there will be a known provision,) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"This means Paradise.\" It is explained further in the next Ayah:\nفَوَكِهُ\n(Fruits) meaning, of different kinds.\nوَهُم مُّكْرَمُونَ\n(and they shall be honored,) means, they will be served and will live a life of luxury.\nفِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ - عَلَى سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَـبِلِينَ\n(In the Gardens of Delight, facing one another on thrones.) Mujahid said, \"One of them will not look at one another's backs.\"\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine -- white, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) This is like the Ayah:\nيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ - بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Immortal boys will go around them (serving), with cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine, from which they will get neither any aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:17-19). Allah refined the wine of Paradise from the bad effects of the wine of this world, which causes headaches and stomach aches -- which is the meaning of Ghawl -- causing people to lose their minds completely. So He says here:\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine) meaning, wine from a flowing stream which they do not fear will ever be cut off or cease. Malik narrated that Zayd bin Aslam said, \"White flowing wine,\" meaning, with a bright, shining color, unlike the wine of this earth with its ugly, repulsive colors of red, black, yellow and turbid shades, and other features which are repugnant to anyone of a sound nature.\nلَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ\n(delicious to the drinkers.) means, its taste will be as good as its color, and a good taste indicates that it has a good smell, unlike the wine of this world.\nلاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ\n(Neither will they have Ghawl from that) means, it will not have any effects on them such as causing stomach aches. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. This is unlike the wine of this world, which causes colic and so on, because it is too watery.\nوَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) Mujahid said, \"It will not cause them to lose their minds.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan. `Ata' bin Abi Muslim Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and others. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, \"Wine causes four things: intoxication, headache, vomiting and urine.\" So, when Allah mentions the wine of Paradise, He states that it is free of these characteristics, as mentioned in Surat As-Saffat.\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf) means, chaste females, who will not look at anyone other than their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said.\nعِينٌ\n(with (wide and beautiful) eyes) means, with beautiful eyes. It was also said that it means with wide eyes, which is connected to the first meaning. They are wide-eyed and beautiful, and their eyes are described as being beautiful and chaste. Allah says:\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ عِينٌ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf, with (wide and beautiful) eyes.)\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) Their bodies are described as having the most perfect color. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, as if they were hidden pearls. Al-Hasan said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun. ) means, protected, never touched by any hands. As-Suddi said, \"The well preserved egg in its nest.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The inside of the egg.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It is the membrane which is between its outer shell and its inner contents.\" As-Suddi said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The white of the egg when its shell is removed.\" Ibn Jarir's view concerning the meaning of Maknun (well preserved) is that the outer shell is touched by the wing of the bird and the nest, and by people's hands, unlike the interior of the egg. And Allah knows best."

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. This is unlike the wine of this world, which causes colic and so on, because it is too watery.\nوَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) Mujahid said, \"It will not cause them to lose their minds.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan. `Ata' bin Abi Muslim Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and others. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, \"Wine causes four things: intoxication, headache, vomiting and urine.\" So, when Allah mentions the wine of Paradise, He states that it is free of these characteristics, as mentioned in Surat As-Saffat.\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf) means, chaste females, who will not look at anyone other than their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said.\nعِينٌ\n(with (wide and beautiful) eyes) means, with beautiful eyes. It was also said that it means with wide eyes, which is connected to the first meaning. They are wide-eyed and beautiful, and their eyes are described as being beautiful and chaste. Allah says:\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ عِينٌ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf, with (wide and beautiful) eyes.)\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) Their bodies are described as having the most perfect color. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, as if they were hidden pearls. Al-Hasan said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun. ) means, protected, never touched by any hands. As-Suddi said, \"The well preserved egg in its nest.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The inside of the egg.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It is the membrane which is between its outer shell and its inner contents.\" As-Suddi said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The white of the egg when its shell is removed.\" Ibn Jarir's view concerning the meaning of Maknun (well preserved) is that the outer shell is touched by the wing of the bird and the nest, and by people's hands, unlike the interior of the egg. And Allah knows best."

This is like the Ayat:\nوَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(By the Time. Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe and do righteous deeds...) (103:1-3),\nلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ فِى أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ - ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَـهُ أَسْفَلَ سَـفِلِينَ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Verily, We created man in the best stature. Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low. Save those who believe and do righteous deeds) (95:4-6).\nوَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا كَانَ عَلَى رَبِّكَ حَتْماً مَّقْضِيّاً - ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً\n(There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished. Then We shall save those who have Taqwa. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein to their knees.) (19:71-72); and\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ\ng(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the right) (74:38-39). Allah says here:\nإِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ\n(Save the chosen servants of Allah.) meaning, they will not taste the painful torment nor will they be brought to account. Their evil acts, if there are any, will be overlooked, and each good deed will be rewarded in multiples of between ten and seven hundred, or as much as Allah wills.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ رِزْقٌ مَّعْلُومٌ\n(For them there will be a known provision,) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"This means Paradise.\" It is explained further in the next Ayah:\nفَوَكِهُ\n(Fruits) meaning, of different kinds.\nوَهُم مُّكْرَمُونَ\n(and they shall be honored,) means, they will be served and will live a life of luxury.\nفِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ - عَلَى سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَـبِلِينَ\n(In the Gardens of Delight, facing one another on thrones.) Mujahid said, \"One of them will not look at one another's backs.\"\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine -- white, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) This is like the Ayah:\nيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ - بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ - لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Immortal boys will go around them (serving), with cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine, from which they will get neither any aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:17-19). Allah refined the wine of Paradise from the bad effects of the wine of this world, which causes headaches and stomach aches -- which is the meaning of Ghawl -- causing people to lose their minds completely. So He says here:\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine) meaning, wine from a flowing stream which they do not fear will ever be cut off or cease. Malik narrated that Zayd bin Aslam said, \"White flowing wine,\" meaning, with a bright, shining color, unlike the wine of this earth with its ugly, repulsive colors of red, black, yellow and turbid shades, and other features which are repugnant to anyone of a sound nature.\nلَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ\n(delicious to the drinkers.) means, its taste will be as good as its color, and a good taste indicates that it has a good smell, unlike the wine of this world.\nلاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ\n(Neither will they have Ghawl from that) means, it will not have any effects on them such as causing stomach aches. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. This is unlike the wine of this world, which causes colic and so on, because it is too watery.\nوَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.) Mujahid said, \"It will not cause them to lose their minds.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan. `Ata' bin Abi Muslim Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and others. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, \"Wine causes four things: intoxication, headache, vomiting and urine.\" So, when Allah mentions the wine of Paradise, He states that it is free of these characteristics, as mentioned in Surat As-Saffat.\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf) means, chaste females, who will not look at anyone other than their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said.\nعِينٌ\n(with (wide and beautiful) eyes) means, with beautiful eyes. It was also said that it means with wide eyes, which is connected to the first meaning. They are wide-eyed and beautiful, and their eyes are described as being beautiful and chaste. Allah says:\nوَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ عِينٌ\n(And beside them will be Qasirat At-Tarf, with (wide and beautiful) eyes.)\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) Their bodies are described as having the most perfect color. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, as if they were hidden pearls. Al-Hasan said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun. ) means, protected, never touched by any hands. As-Suddi said, \"The well preserved egg in its nest.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The inside of the egg.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It is the membrane which is between its outer shell and its inner contents.\" As-Suddi said:\nكَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(as if they were Bayd Maknun.) means, \"The white of the egg when its shell is removed.\" Ibn Jarir's view concerning the meaning of Maknun (well preserved) is that the outer shell is touched by the wing of the bird and the nest, and by people's hands, unlike the interior of the egg. And Allah knows best."

Qatadah said, \"The angels form ranks in the heavens.\" Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ، وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا، وَجُعِلَ لَنَا تُرَابُهَا طَهُورًا، إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء»\n(We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)\" Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»\n(Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:\n«يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْمُتَقَدِّمَةَ، وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّف»\n(They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )\" As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah\nفَالزَجِرَتِ زَجْراً\n(By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.\nفَالتَّـلِيَـتِ ذِكْراً\n(By those who bring the Dhikr.) As-Suddi said, \"The angels bring the Scriptures and the Qur'an from Allah to mankind.\"\nThe One True God is Allah\nإِنَّ إِلَـهَكُمْ لَوَاحِدٌ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(Verily, your God is indeed One, Lord of the heavens and the earth,) This is the One by Whom the oath is sworn, stating that there is no God worthy of worship but He, Lord of the heavens and the earth,\nوَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n(and all that is between them,) means, of created beings.\nوَرَبُّ الْمَشَـرِقِ\n(and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.) means, He is the Sovereign Who is controlling His creation by subjugating it and all that is in it of stars, planets and heavenly bodies which appear from the east and set in the west. Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:\nفَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ إِنَّا لَقَـدِرُونَ\n(So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.) (70:40)\nرَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ\n((He is) the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests. ) (55:17) which refers to the rising and setting points of the sun and the moon in both winter and summer."

Ibn Jarir said, \"These are the Words of Allah, and it means: for the like of this pleasure and this success, let the workers work in this world, so that they may attain it in the Hereafter.\nThe Story of Two Israelites\nThey mentioned the story of two men among the Children of Israel who were partners and who are included in the meaning of this Ayah. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Furat bin Tha`labah Al-Bahrani said concerning the Ayah,\nإِنِّى كَانَ لِى قَرِينٌ\n(Verily, I had a companion) \"There were two men who were partners and had collected eight thousand Dinars. One of them had a craft and the other did not. The one who had a craft said to the other, `You do not have a craft, so I think I will divide the money with you and leave you.' So he left him. Then the man bought a house, belonging to a king who had died, for the price of one thousand Dinars. He called his companion and showed him the house, saying, `What do you think of this house I bought it for one thousand Dinars.' He said, `How beautiful it is.' When he went out he said, `O Allah, this companion of mine has bought this house for one thousand Dinars; I ask You for one of the houses of Paradise -- and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity.' Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass. The first man married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars, and invited his companion and made food for him. When he came, he said, `I have married this woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars.' He replied; `How beautiful this is.' And when he left, he said, `O Lord, my companion has married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars; I ask you for a wife from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn' -- and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity. Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass. Then the first man bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars, then he called his companion and showed them to him. He said, `I have bought these two gardens for two thousand Dinars.' He replied, `How beautiful this is.' When he came out, he said, `O Lord, my companion has bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars; I ask you for two gardens in Paradise' -- and he gave two thousand Dinars in charity. Then the angel came to them and took their souls in death. He took the one who had given his money in charity and put him in a house that he liked. There, there was a woman who was so beautiful that the ground shinned under her, then he (the angel) took him to two gardens and gave him other things which are known only to Allah. The man said, `This is like a man who has such and such.' The angel said, `That is exactly what it is; this house, these gardens and this wife are all for you.' The man said, `I had a companion who used to say: Are you among those who believe' It was said to him, `He is in Hell.' He said, `Will you look down' So he looked down and saw him in the midst of Hell. At this, he said:\nقَالَ تَاللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرْدِينِ - وَلَوْلاَ نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ\n(By Allah! You have nearly ruined me.

      "text": "The Adornment and Protection of the Heaven comes from Allah\nAllah tells us that He has adorned the lowest heaven with the heavenly bodies for those among the people of the earth who look at it. The stars and planets in the sky give light to the people of earth, as Allah says:\nوَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) (67:5),\nوَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:\nوَحِفْظاً\n(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,\nمِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ\n(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:\nلاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى\n(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ\n(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:\nوَيَقْذِفُونَ\n(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,\nمِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ\n(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.\nدُحُوراً\n(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.\nوَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ\n(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:\nوَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah.\" -- Waki` said, \"This means in the valley of Nakhlah.\" -- \"They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.\"'"

This is like the Ayah:\nوَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلأَكِلِيِنَ\n(And a tree that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows (produces) oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters.) (23:20) -- which is the olive tree. This is supported by the Ayah:\nثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ أَيُّهَا الضَّآلُّونَ الْمُكَذِّبُونَ - لاّكِلُونَ مِن شَجَرٍ مِّن زَقُّومٍ\n(Then moreover, verily, -- you the erring-ones, the deniers!

Qatadah said, \"The tree of Zaqqum is mentioned as a test for those who are misguided. They said, `Your companion tells you that in the Fire there is a tree, but fire consumes trees.' Then Allah revealed the words:\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire.) meaning, it is nourished by the fire, for it was created from fire.\" Mujahid said:\nإِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهَا فِتْنَةً لِّلظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.) Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, \"Zaqqum means dates and butter which I eat Atazaqqamuhu.\" I say that the meaning of the Ayah is, \"We have told you, O Muhammad, of the tree of Zaqqum as a trial with which We test the people to see who will believe and who will disbelieve.\" This is like the Ayah:\nوَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّءْيَا الَّتِى أَرَيْنَـكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِى القُرْءَانِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا\n(And We made not the vision which we showed you but a trial for mankind, and the accursed tree in the Qur'an.

Then thirst will be sent upon them, so they will ask to be given something to drink, and they will be given water like boiling oil that has been heated to the ultimate degree. When it is brought near to their mouths, the flesh of their faces from which the skin has fallen off will be baked by its heat, and whatever is in their stomachs will melt. They will walk with their guts falling out and with their skin falling off, then they will be beaten with hooked rods of iron. Then every part of their bodies will burst into loud lamentations.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.) means, after that interval, they will be sent back to the burning fire, searing heat and scorching flames, and they will rotate between the one and the other.

It is likened to\nرُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ\n(the heads of Shayatin ), even though they have never seen them, because it is a well-established idea in people's minds that devils are ugly in appearance.\nفَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ\n(Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.) Allah mentions that they will eat of this extremely ugly tree even though its fruit tastes and smells so bad; they will be forced to eat from it because they will not find anything else to eat except this tree and similar things, as Allah says:\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ - لاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but a poisonous thorny plant, Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.)

Someone else said that it means boiling water will be mixed with pus and offensive discharges that leak from their private parts and eyes. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"When the people of Hell get hungry, they will ask for food from the tree of Zaqqum. They will eat from it, then the skin of their faces will fall off, If someone were to pass by, he would recognize them from their faces. Then thirst will be sent upon them, so they will ask to be given something to drink, and they will be given water like boiling oil that has been heated to the ultimate degree. When it is brought near to their mouths, the flesh of their faces from which the skin has fallen off will be baked by its heat, and whatever is in their stomachs will melt. They will walk with their guts falling out and with their skin falling off, then they will be beaten with hooked rods of iron. Then every part of their bodies will burst into loud lamentations.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.) means, after that interval, they will be sent back to the burning fire, searing heat and scorching flames, and they will rotate between the one and the other. This is like the Ayah,\nيَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!) (55:44). Qatadah recited this Ayah when discussing this Ayah. This is a good interpretation. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it differently, with the meaning \"Their return in the afternoon.\" `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, midday on the Day of Resurrection will not come until the people of Paradise will be in Paradise and the people of Hell will be in Hell.\" Then he recited:\nأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً\n(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose) (25:24).

(67:5),\nوَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:\nوَحِفْظاً\n(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,\nمِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ\n(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:\nلاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى\n(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ\n(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:\nوَيَقْذِفُونَ\n(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,\nمِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ\n(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.\nدُحُوراً\n(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.\nوَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ\n(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:\nوَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah.\" -- Waki` said, \"This means in the valley of Nakhlah.\" -- \"They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.\"'"

      "text": "The Tree of Zaqqum and its Companions\nHere Allah asks: `Is that which He has mentioned of the delights of Paradise with its food, drink, companions and other joys better entertainment, or\nأَمْ شَجَرَةُ الزَّقُّومِ\n(or the tree of Zaqqum) which is in Hell' The meaning here is a specific kind of tree which is called Zaqqum. This is like the Ayah:\nوَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلأَكِلِيِنَ\n(And a tree that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows (produces) oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters.) (23:20) -- which is the olive tree. This is supported by the Ayah:\nثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ أَيُّهَا الضَّآلُّونَ الْمُكَذِّبُونَ - لاّكِلُونَ مِن شَجَرٍ مِّن زَقُّومٍ\n(Then moreover, verily, -- you the erring-ones, the deniers! You, verily, will eat of the trees of Zaqqum.) (56:51-52).\nإِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهَا فِتْنَةً لِّلظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.) Qatadah said, \"The tree of Zaqqum is mentioned as a test for those who are misguided. They said, `Your companion tells you that in the Fire there is a tree, but fire consumes trees.' Then Allah revealed the words:\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire.) meaning, it is nourished by the fire, for it was created from fire.\" Mujahid said:\nإِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهَا فِتْنَةً لِّلظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.) Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, \"Zaqqum means dates and butter which I eat Atazaqqamuhu.\" I say that the meaning of the Ayah is, \"We have told you, O Muhammad, of the tree of Zaqqum as a trial with which We test the people to see who will believe and who will disbelieve.\" This is like the Ayah:\nوَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّءْيَا الَّتِى أَرَيْنَـكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِى القُرْءَانِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا\n(And We made not the vision which we showed you but a trial for mankind, and the accursed tree in the Qur'an. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah) (17:60).\nإِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ\n(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire.) means, its roots grow at the bottom of Hell.\nطَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ\n(The shoots of its fruit stalks are like the heads of Shayatin. ) this is a description of how ugly and repulsive it is. It is likened to\nرُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ\n(the heads of Shayatin ), even though they have never seen them, because it is a well-established idea in people's minds that devils are ugly in appearance.\nفَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ\n(Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.) Allah mentions that they will eat of this extremely ugly tree even though its fruit tastes and smells so bad; they will be forced to eat from it because they will not find anything else to eat except this tree and similar things, as Allah says:\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ - لاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but a poisonous thorny plant, Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) (88:6 -7).\nثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ\n(Then on the top of that they will be boiling Hamim) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"This means they will be given boiling Hamim to drink after they have eaten from Zaqqum.\" According to another report, he said that this means a mixture made from boiling water. Someone else said that it means boiling water will be mixed with pus and offensive discharges that leak from their private parts and eyes. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"When the people of Hell get hungry, they will ask for food from the tree of Zaqqum. They will eat from it, then the skin of their faces will fall off, If someone were to pass by, he would recognize them from their faces. Then thirst will be sent upon them, so they will ask to be given something to drink, and they will be given water like boiling oil that has been heated to the ultimate degree. When it is brought near to their mouths, the flesh of their faces from which the skin has fallen off will be baked by its heat, and whatever is in their stomachs will melt. They will walk with their guts falling out and with their skin falling off, then they will be beaten with hooked rods of iron. Then every part of their bodies will burst into loud lamentations.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.) means, after that interval, they will be sent back to the burning fire, searing heat and scorching flames, and they will rotate between the one and the other. This is like the Ayah,\nيَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ\n(They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!) (55:44). Qatadah recited this Ayah when discussing this Ayah. This is a good interpretation. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it differently, with the meaning \"Their return in the afternoon.\" `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, midday on the Day of Resurrection will not come until the people of Paradise will be in Paradise and the people of Hell will be in Hell.\" Then he recited:\nأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً\n(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose) (25:24). Allah's saying;\nإِنَّهُمْ أَلْفَوْاْ ءَابَآءَهُمْ ضَآلِّينَ\n(Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path;) means, `We will punish them for that because they found their fathers following misguidance and they followed them with no evidence or proof.' Allah says:\nفَهُمْ عَلَى ءَاثَارِهِمْ يُهْرَعُونَ\n(So they (too) hastened in their footsteps!) Mujahid said, \"This is like running.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"They followed ignorance and foolishness.\""

He stayed among them for one thousand years less fifty, and after he stayed among them for so long and their disbelief became too much for him to bear -- for every time he called them, they turned away from him even more -- he prayed to his Lord saying, \"I have been overcome, so help (me)!\" So Allah became angry because Nuh was angry with them.

      "text": "The Adornment and Protection of the Heaven comes from Allah\nAllah tells us that He has adorned the lowest heaven with the heavenly bodies for those among the people of the earth who look at it. The stars and planets in the sky give light to the people of earth, as Allah says:\nوَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) (67:5),\nوَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:\nوَحِفْظاً\n(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,\nمِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ\n(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:\nلاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى\n(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ\n(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:\nوَيَقْذِفُونَ\n(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,\nمِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ\n(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.\nدُحُوراً\n(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.\nوَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ\n(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:\nوَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah.\" -- Waki` said, \"This means in the valley of Nakhlah.\" -- \"They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.\"'"

But this is not the kind of real lie for which a person is to be condemned -- Allah forbid! One calls it a lie for lack of a better word, because it is abstruse speech used for a legitimate religious purpose, and it was said that what was meant by the words,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick) was, `I am sick at heart of your worshipping idols instead of Allah.' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"The people of Ibrahim went out to their festival and they wanted to make him go out too.

Allah said:\nفَتَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ\n(So they turned away from him and departed.) meaning, he went to them after they had left, quickly and secretly.\nفَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ\n(and said: \"Will you not eat\") They had placed food before them as a sacrifice, so that the food might be blessed. When Ibrahim, peace be upon him, looked at the food that was before them, he said:\nفَرَاغَ إِلَى ءَالِهَتِهِمْ فَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ - مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنطِقُونَ\n(Will you not eat What is the matter with you that you speak not)\nفَرَاغَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْباً بِالْيَمِينِ\n(Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand.) Al-Farra' said, \"This means, he started to hit them with his right hand.\" Qatadah and Al-Jawhari said, \"He turned to them, hitting them with his right hand.\" He struck them with his right hand because the right hand is stronger and more powerful. Then he left them broken to pieces, (all) except the biggest of them, that they might turn to it, as we have already seen in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya'.\nفَأَقْبَلُواْ إِلَيْهِ يَزِفُّونَ\n(Then they came hastily towards him.) Mujahid and others said, \"This means, they came rushing. The story is told in brief here; in Surat Al-Anbiya', it is told in more detail.

      "text": "The Adornment and Protection of the Heaven comes from Allah\nAllah tells us that He has adorned the lowest heaven with the heavenly bodies for those among the people of the earth who look at it. The stars and planets in the sky give light to the people of earth, as Allah says:\nوَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) (67:5),\nوَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:\nوَحِفْظاً\n(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,\nمِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ\n(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:\nلاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى\n(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,\nحَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ\n(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:\nوَيَقْذِفُونَ\n(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,\nمِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ\n(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.\nدُحُوراً\n(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.\nوَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ\n(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:\nوَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ\n(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ\n(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah.\" -- Waki` said, \"This means in the valley of Nakhlah.\" -- \"They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.\"'"

Ibn Jarir narrated here a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, stating that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«لَمْ يَكْذِبْ إِبْرَاهِيمُ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ غَيْرَ ثَلَاثَ كَذَبَاتٍ: ثِنْتَيْنِ فِي ذَاتِ اللهِ تَعَالَى، قَوْلُهُ:\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\nوَقَوْلُهُ:\nبَلْ فَعَلَهُ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَـذَا\nوَقَوْلُهُ فِي سَارَّةَ: هِيَ أُخْتِي»\n(Ibrahim (peace and blessings be upon him) did not lie except in three cases. Two were for the sake of Allah: (one is) when he said, (Verily, I am sick); and (the second) when he said, (Nay, this one, the biggest (his wife) of them (idols) did it.) and (the third) when he said concerning (his wife) Sarah, \"She is my sister.\") This Hadith is recorded in the books of the Sahih and Sunan with various chain of narrations. But this is not the kind of real lie for which a person is to be condemned -- Allah forbid! One calls it a lie for lack of a better word, because it is abstruse speech used for a legitimate religious purpose, and it was said that what was meant by the words,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick) was, `I am sick at heart of your worshipping idols instead of Allah.' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"The people of Ibrahim went out to their festival and they wanted to make him go out too. So he lay down on his back and said,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick.) and he started looking at the sky. When they had gone out, he turned to their gods and broke them.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah said:\nفَتَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ\n(So they turned away from him and departed.) meaning, he went to them after they had left, quickly and secretly.\nفَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ\n(and said: \"Will you not eat\") They had placed food before them as a sacrifice, so that the food might be blessed. When Ibrahim, peace be upon him, looked at the food that was before them, he said:\nفَرَاغَ إِلَى ءَالِهَتِهِمْ فَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ - مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنطِقُونَ\n(Will you not eat What is the matter with you that you speak not)\nفَرَاغَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْباً بِالْيَمِينِ\n(Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand.) Al-Farra' said, \"This means, he started to hit them with his right hand.\" Qatadah and Al-Jawhari said, \"He turned to them, hitting them with his right hand.\" He struck them with his right hand because the right hand is stronger and more powerful. Then he left them broken to pieces, (all) except the biggest of them, that they might turn to it, as we have already seen in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya'.\nفَأَقْبَلُواْ إِلَيْهِ يَزِفُّونَ\n(Then they came hastily towards him.) Mujahid and others said, \"This means, they came rushing. The story is told in brief here; in Surat Al-Anbiya', it is told in more detail. When they returned, they did not know at first who had done this, until they investigated and found out that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was the one who had done it. When they came to rebuke him, he started rebuking and criticizing them and said:\nأَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا تَنْحِتُونَ\n(Worship you that which you carve) meaning, `do you worship instead of Allah idols which you yourselves carve and fashion with your own hands'\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(While Allah has created you and what you make!) This may mean, `Allah has created you and what you do;' or it may mean, `Allah has created you and what you make.' Both views are synonymous. The former is more apparent because of the report recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book Af`al Al-`Ibad from Hudhayfah, attributed to the Prophet :\n«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَصْنَعُ كُلَّ صَانِعٍ وَصَنْعَتَه»\n(Allah has created every doer of deeds and what he does.) Thereupon he recited:\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(While Allah has created you and what you make!) When the proof had been established against them, they resolved to seize him by force and they said:\nابْنُواْ لَهُ بُنْيَـناً فَأَلْقُوهُ فِى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Build for him a building (i.e., furnace) and throw him into the blazing fire!) There happened what we have already discussed in our Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya', (21:68-70) and Allah saved him from the fire and caused him to prevail over them, making his proof supreme and supporting it. Allah says:\nفَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَـهُمُ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ\n(So, they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.)"

Qatadah said, \"The Arabs say of one who thinks deeply that he is looking at the stars.\" What Qatadah meant is that he looked at the heavens thinking of a way to distract his people. So he said,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick.) meaning, weak. Ibn Jarir narrated here a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, stating that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«لَمْ يَكْذِبْ إِبْرَاهِيمُ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ غَيْرَ ثَلَاثَ كَذَبَاتٍ: ثِنْتَيْنِ فِي ذَاتِ اللهِ تَعَالَى، قَوْلُهُ:\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\nوَقَوْلُهُ:\nبَلْ فَعَلَهُ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَـذَا\nوَقَوْلُهُ فِي سَارَّةَ: هِيَ أُخْتِي»\n(Ibrahim (peace and blessings be upon him) did not lie except in three cases. Two were for the sake of Allah: (one is) when he said, (Verily, I am sick); and (the second) when he said, (Nay, this one, the biggest (his wife) of them (idols) did it.) and (the third) when he said concerning (his wife) Sarah, \"She is my sister.\") This Hadith is recorded in the books of the Sahih and Sunan with various chain of narrations. But this is not the kind of real lie for which a person is to be condemned -- Allah forbid! One calls it a lie for lack of a better word, because it is abstruse speech used for a legitimate religious purpose, and it was said that what was meant by the words,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick) was, `I am sick at heart of your worshipping idols instead of Allah.' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"The people of Ibrahim went out to their festival and they wanted to make him go out too. So he lay down on his back and said,\nإِنِّى سَقِيمٌ\n(Verily, I am sick.) and he started looking at the sky. When they had gone out, he turned to their gods and broke them.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah said:\nفَتَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ\n(So they turned away from him and departed.) meaning, he went to them after they had left, quickly and secretly.\nفَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ\n(and said: \"Will you not eat\") They had placed food before them as a sacrifice, so that the food might be blessed. When Ibrahim, peace be upon him, looked at the food that was before them, he said:\nفَرَاغَ إِلَى ءَالِهَتِهِمْ فَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ - مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنطِقُونَ\n(Will you not eat What is the matter with you that you speak not)\nفَرَاغَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْباً بِالْيَمِينِ\n(Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand.) Al-Farra' said, \"This means, he started to hit them with his right hand.\" Qatadah and Al-Jawhari said, \"He turned to them, hitting them with his right hand.\" He struck them with his right hand because the right hand is stronger and more powerful. Then he left them broken to pieces, (all) except the biggest of them, that they might turn to it, as we have already seen in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya'.\nفَأَقْبَلُواْ إِلَيْهِ يَزِفُّونَ\n(Then they came hastily towards him.) Mujahid and others said, \"This means, they came rushing. The story is told in brief here; in Surat Al-Anbiya', it is told in more detail. When they returned, they did not know at first who had done this, until they investigated and found out that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was the one who had done it. When they came to rebuke him, he started rebuking and criticizing them and said:\nأَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا تَنْحِتُونَ\n(Worship you that which you carve) meaning, `do you worship instead of Allah idols which you yourselves carve and fashion with your own hands'\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(While Allah has created you and what you make!) This may mean, `Allah has created you and what you do;' or it may mean, `Allah has created you and what you make.' Both views are synonymous. The former is more apparent because of the report recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book Af`al Al-`Ibad from Hudhayfah, attributed to the Prophet :\n«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَصْنَعُ كُلَّ صَانِعٍ وَصَنْعَتَه»\n(Allah has created every doer of deeds and what he does.) Thereupon he recited:\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(While Allah has created you and what you make!) When the proof had been established against them, they resolved to seize him by force and they said:\nابْنُواْ لَهُ بُنْيَـناً فَأَلْقُوهُ فِى الْجَحِيمِ\n(Build for him a building (i.e., furnace) and throw him into the blazing fire!) There happened what we have already discussed in our Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya', (21:68-70) and Allah saved him from the fire and caused him to prevail over them, making his proof supreme and supporting it. Allah says:\nفَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَـهُمُ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ\n(So, they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.)"

      "surah": 37,
      "text": "Ibrahim's Emigration, the Test of the Sacrifice of Isma`il, and how Allah blessed Him\nAllah tells us that after He helped His close friend Ibrahim, peace be upon him, against his people, and after Ibrahim gave up hoping that they would ever believe despite all the mighty signs that they had witnessed, he emigrated away from them, and said:\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ - رَبِّ هَبْ لِى مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينِ\n(Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me! My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.) meaning, obedient children, in compensation for his people and relatives whom he had left. Allah said:\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِغُلَـمٍ حَلِيمٍ\n(So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.) This child was Isma`il, peace be upon him, for he was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and he was older than Ishaq. The Muslims and the People of the Book agree, and indeed it is stated in their Book, that Isma`il, peace be upon him, was born when Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was eighty-six years old, and Ishaq was born when Ibrahim was ninety-nine years old. According to their Book, Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his only son, and in another text it says his firstborn son. But here they falsely inserted the name of Ishaq. This is not right because it goes against what their own Scripture says. They inserted the name of Ishaq because he is their ancestor, while Isma`il is the ancestor of the Arabs. They were jealous of them, so they added this idea and changed the meaning of the phrase \"only son\" to mean `the only son who is with you,' because Isma`il had been taken with his mother to Makkah. But this is a case of falsification and distortion, because the words \"only son\" cannot be said except in the case of one who has no other son. Furthermore, the firstborn son has a special status that is not shared by subsequent children, so the command to sacrifice him is a more exquisite test.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he grew up and started to go with his father and walk with him, for Ibrahim used to go every so often to check on his son and his mother in the land of Faran (i.e., Makkah), to see how they were doing. It was said that he used to ride on Al-Buraq, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him,) means, when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did.\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ قَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\") `Ubayd bin `Umayr said, \"The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,\" then he recited this Ayah:\nقَالَ يبُنَىَّ إِنِّى أَرَى فِى الْمَنَامِ أَنِّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى\n(he said: \"O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!\"). He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father.\nقَالَ يأَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ\n(He said: \"O my father! Do that which you are commanded...\") meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.'\nسَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ\n(if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient.) meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. Allah said:\nوَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً - وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً\n(And mention in the Book Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) (19:54-55).\nفَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, when both of them had pronounced the Shahadah and remembered Allah -- Ibrahim because he was about to offer a sacrifice and Isma`il because he was about to die. Or it was said that \"submitted themselves\" means that they submitted and followed the command of Allah; Ibrahim obeyed the command of Allah and Isma`il obeyed Allah and his father. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Ishaq, and others. lThe meaning of the phrase \"and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead\" is: he placed him facedown so that he could slaughter him from behind, and not have to see his face at the time of slaughter, so that it would be easier for him. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said:\nوَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ\n(and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;) means, \"He turned him upside down on his face.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When the rituals were enjoined upon Ibrahim, peace be upon him, the Shaytan appeared to him at the Mas`a and raced with him, but Ibrahim got there first. Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and the Shaytan appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Isma`il, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind:\nأَن يإِبْرَهِيمُقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!) Ibrahim turned, and saw a fine, horned, white ram.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to look for similar types of rams.\" Hisham mentioned this Hadith at length in Al-Manasik.\nوَنَـدَيْنَـهُ أَن يإِبْرَهِيمُ قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(We called out to him: \"O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the dream!\") means, `the purpose of your dream has been fulfilled by your laying down your son to sacrifice him.' As-Suddi and others said that he passed the knife over Isma`il's neck, but it did not cut him at all, because a sheet of copper was placed between them. Ibrahim was called at that point, and it was said:\nقَدْ صَدَّقْتَ الرُّؤْيَآ\n(You have fulfilled the dream!) Allah says;\nإِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.) means, `this is how We deal with those who obey Us in things that are difficult for them; We make for them a way out.' As Allah says:\nفَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً\n(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) (65:2-3). On the basis of this Ayah and this story, some of the scholars of Usul have stated that it is valid for a ruling to be abrogated before anyone is able to act upon it -- unlike some of the Mu`tazilah. The evidence for this is obvious, because Allah commanded Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to sacrifice his son, then He abrogated that and pointed out the ransom. The purpose of His command had been primarily to reward His close Friend for his patience and resolve in sacrificing his son. Allah says:\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلاَءُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.) meaning, it was clearly a test when he was commanded to sacrifice his son, so, he hastened to do it, in submission to the command of Allah and in obedience to Him. Allah said:\nوَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى\n(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that.) (53:37), and\nوَفَدَيْنَـهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, \"A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him.\" On one occasion she said, \"I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ رَأَيْتُ قَرْنَيِ الْكَبْشِ حِينَ دَخَلْتُ الْبَيْتَ فَنَسِيتُ أَنْ آمُرَكَ أَنْ تُخَمِّرَهُمَا فَخَمِّرْهُمَا، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِي الْبَيْتِ شَيْءٌ يَشْغَلُ الْمُصَلِّي»\n(I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House i.e., the Ka`bah, and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)\"' Sufyan said, \"The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.\" This offers independent evidence that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Ibrahim sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent. And Allah knows best.\nReports which state that the One Who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, and that this is Correct with\nSa`id bin Jubayr, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Yusuf bin Mihran, Mujahid, `Ata' and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that it was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The one who was ransomed was Isma`il, peace be upon him. The Jews claimed that it was Ishaq, but the Jews lied.\" It was reported that Ibn `Umar said, \"The sacrifice was Isma`il.\" Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\" This was also the view of Yusuf bin Mihran. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"It was Isma`il, peace be upon him, and I saw the horns of the ram in the Ka`bah.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Al-Hasan bin Dinar and `Amr bin `Ubayd from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he did not doubt that the one of the two sons Ibrahim was commanded to sacrifice was Isma`il, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi say, `The one whom Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice of his two sons was Isma`il.' We find this in the Book of Allah, because when Allah finishes the story of the one of the two sons of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed, He then says:\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous), and\nفَبَشَّرْنَـهَا بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(So, We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub) (11:71). He mentions the son and the son of the son, but He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Ishaq when He had promised that this son would in turn have a son. The one whom He commanded him to sacrifice can only have been Isma`il.\" Ibn Ishaq said, \"I heard him say that often.\" Ibn Ishaq reported from Buraydah bin Sufyan bin Farwah Al-Aslami that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi told them that he mentioned that to `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was Khalifah, while he was with him in Syria. `Umar said to him, \"This is something about which I have never given any thought, but I see that it is as you say.\" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Syria, a Jew who had become a Muslim and was committed to Islam, and he thought that he had been one of their scholars. `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, asked him about that. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"I was with `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz. `Umar said to him, `Which of the two sons of Ibrahim was he commanded to sacrifice' He said, `Isma`il. By Allah, O Commander of the faithful, the Jews know this, but they were jealous of you Arabs because it was your father about whom Allah issued this command and the virtue that Allah mentioned was because of his patience in obeying the command. So they denied that and claimed that it was Ishaq, because he is their father.\"' `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"I asked my father about which son was to be sacrificed -- was it Isma`il or Ishaq\" He said, \"Isma`il.\" This was mentioned in Kitab Az-Zuhd. Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I heard my father say, `The correct view is that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il, peace be upon him.\"' He said, \"And it was narrated that `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Abu At-Tufayl, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali and Abu Salih, may Allah be pleased with them all, said that the one who was to be sacrificed was Isma`il.\" Al-Baghawi said in his Tafsir, \"This was the view of `Abdullah bin `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Kalbi.\" This was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and from Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala'.\nوَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ\n(And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.) having given the glad tidings of the one who was to be sacrificed, who was Isma`il, Allah immediately follows that with mention of the glad tidings of his brother Ishaq. This is also mentioned in Surah Hud (11:71) and in Surat Al-Hijr (15:53-55).\nنَبِيّاً\n(a Prophet) means, from him there will come a righteous Prophet.\nوَبَـرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَى إِسْحَـقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ\n(We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.) This is like the Ayah:\nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَـتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you, but people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\") (11:48)"
