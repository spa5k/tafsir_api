This indicates that these are verses of the Qur'an, in which the wisdom of judgment is clear.\nThe Messenger cannot be but a Human Being\nAllah rebukes the attitude of the disbelievers with the words\nأَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا\n(Is it a wonder for mankind...) They have always found it strange that Allah would send Messengers to them from among mankind. Allah also tells us about other people from previous nations who said,\nأَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا\n(Shall mere men guide us) (64:6) Hud and Salih said to their people:\nأَوَ عَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْكُمْ\n(Do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you.) (7:63) Allah also told us what the disbelievers from Quraysh said:\nأَجَعَلَ الاٌّلِهَةَ إِلَـهاً وَحِداً إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عُجَابٌ\n(Has he made the gods into one God Verily, this is a curious thing!) (38:5) Ad-Dahhak reported Ibn `Abbas that he said: \"When Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ as a Messenger, most of the Arabs denied him and his message and said: Allah is greater than sending a human Messenger like Muhammad ﷺ. \" Ibn `Abbas said, \"So Allah revealed:\nأَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا\n(Is it a wonder for mankind...)\" Allah's statement;\nأَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ\n(that they shall have with their Lord the rewards of their good deeds) Scholars have differed over the meaning of the reward for the good deeds in this Ayah:\nوَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ\n(and give good news to those who believe that they shall have with their Lord the rewards of their good deeds.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah, \"Eternal happiness has been written for them.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"It is the good reward for what they have done.\" Mujahid said: \"It is their good deeds -- their prayers, fasting, charity, and glorification.\" He then said, \"And Muhammad will intercede for them.\" Allah said:\nقَالَ الْكَـفِرُونَ إِنَّ هَـذَا لَسَـحِرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n((But) the disbelievers say: \"This is indeed an evident sorcerer!\") This means that the disbelievers said this although Allah has sent a Messenger from among themselves to them, a man of their own race as a bearer of good news and as a warner. But they are the liars in saying that."

      "text": "The Good Reward is for the People of Faith and Good Deeds\nIn these two Ayat, Allah promises the happy blessings for those who believed in Allah and His Messengers. And for those that have complied with what they were commanded to follow. The promise is that He will guide them because of their faith, or it may mean through their faith. As to the first interpretation, the meaning is that Allah will guide them on the Day of Resurrection to the straight path until they pass into Paradise because of their faith in this world. The other meaning is that their faith will assist them on the Day of Resurrection as Mujahid said:\nيَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ\n(Their Lord will guide them through their faith) meaning \"Their faith will be a light in which they will walk.\"\nدَعْوَهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَـنَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(Their way of request therein will be: \"Glory to You, O Allah!\" And Salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein! And the close of their request will be: \"All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\") meaning this is the condition of the people of Paradise. This is similar to what is found in the following Ayat:\nتَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُ سَلَـمٌ\n(Their greeting on the Day they shall meet Him will be \"Salam Peace!\") 33:44,\nلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً\n(No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!!\") 56:25-26,\nسَلاَمٌ قَوْلاً مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ\n((It will be said to them): \"Salam\" -- a Word from the Lord, Most Merciful.) 36:58,\nوَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍسَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ\n(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)!\") 13:23-24 In Allah's statement,\nوَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And the close of their request will be: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\") There is an indication that Allah Almighty is the Praised One always, the Worshipped at all times. This is why He praised Himself at the beginning and the duration of His creation. He also praised Himself in the beginning of His Book and the beginning of its revelation. Allah said:\nالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ\n(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant the Book (the Qur'an).) 18:1,\nالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ\n(All praise is due to Allah, Who (alone) created the heavens and the earth,) 6:1, and many other citations with this meaning. The Ayah also indicates that Allah is the Praised One in this world and in the Hereafter and in all situations. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim:\n«إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ يُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّحْمِيدَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»\n(The people of Paradise will be inspired to glorify Allah and praise Him as they instinctively breath.) This will be their nature because of the increasing bounties of Allah upon them. These bounties are repeated and brought back again and increased with no limit or termination. So praise be to Allah for there is no God but He and no Lord save He."

      "text": "It is not Part of Allah's Decree to compel Belief\nAllah said:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ\n(And had your Lord willed) meaning `O Muhammad, if it had been the will of your Lord, He would make all the people of the earth believe in what you have brought to them. But Allah has wisdom in what He does.' Similarly, Allah said:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ\nإِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاّمْلاّنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one Ummah, but they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy and for that did He create them. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (His saying): \"Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.\") (11:118-119) He also said,\nأَفَلَمْ يَاْيْـَسِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا\n(Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind) (13:31) Therefore, Allah said:\nأَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ\n(So, will you then compel mankind) and force them to believe.\nحَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(until they become believers.) meaning, it is not for you to do that. You are not commanded to do that either. It is Allah Who\nيُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.)(35:8).\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So do not destroy yourself in sorrow for them.)\nلَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(It is not up to you to guide them, but Allah guides whom He wills.)2:272.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(It may be that you would kill yourself with grief because they are not believers.) 26:3\nإِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ\n(you guide not who you like..) 28:56\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(Your duty is only to convey, and it is up to Us to reckon. ) 13:40\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind, you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.) 88:21-22 There are other Ayat besides these which prove that Allah is the doer of what He wants, guiding whom He wills, leading whom He wills to stray, all out of His knowledge, wisdom, and justice. Similarly, He said,\nوَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَن تُؤْمِنَ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَيَجْعَلُ الرِّجْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(It is not for any person to believe, except by the leave of Allah, and He will put the Rijs) That is, disorder and misguidance\nعَلَى الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(upon those who do not reason) meaning, Allah's proofs and evidences, and He is the Just in all matters, guiding whom He wills to guide, and leading whom He wills astray."

      "text": "The Command to reflect upon the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth\nAllah, the Exalted, guides His servants to reflect upon His blessings. What Allah has created in the heavens and the earth is part of the clear signs for those who possess correct understanding. From that which is in the heavens are the luminous stars, the firmaments, the moving planetary bodies, the sun and the moon. This also includes the night and day, their alternating, and their merging so that one is long and the other is short. Then they alternate (through the year) so that the long one becomes short and the short one becomes long. Likewise, from the signs in the heavens is the rising of the sun, its vastness, its beauty and its adornment. Also, whatever rain that Allah sends down from the heavens, thereby bringing the earth to life after its death, and causing various types of fruits, crops, flowers and plants to grow, is from its signs. Whatever Allah creates in the earth from the various species of beasts, with their differing colors and benefits (for man), are signs. The mountains, plains, deserts, civilizations, structures and barren lands of the earth are signs. Then there are the wonders of the sea and its waves. Yet, it still has been made subservient and submissive to those who travel upon its surface. It carries their ships, allowing them to traverse upon it with ease. This is all under the control of the Most Able; there is no God worthy of worship except Him and there is no true Lord other than Him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(But neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who do not believe.) This means, `What thing will benefit such disbelieving people besides the heavenly and earthly signs, and the Messengers with their miracles, proofs and evidences that clearly prove the truthfulness of their message' This is similar to Allah's statement,\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(Truly! Those against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.) 10:96 Concerning Allah's statement,\nفَهَلْ يَنتَظِرُونَ إِلاَّ مِثْلَ أَيَّامِ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ\n(Then do they wait save for the likes of the days of men who passed away before them) This means, `Are these who reject you Muhammad ﷺ, waiting for the vengeance and torment like the Days of Allah, when He punished those who came before them of the previous nations that rejected their Messengers'\nقُلْ فَانْتَظِرُواْ إِنَّى مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ الْمُنْتَظِرِينَثُمَّ نُنَجِّى رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ\n(Say: \"Wait then, I am waiting with you among those who wait.\" Then We save Our Messengers and those who believe!) This means, `Verily, We destroy those who reject the Messengers.'\nكَذَلِكَ حَقًّا عَلَيْنَا نُنجِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(Thus it is incumbent upon Us to save the believers.) This means that this is a right that Allah, the Exalted, has obligated upon His Noble Self.

      "text": "The Command to worship Allah Alone and rely upon Him\nAllah, the Exalted, says to His Messenger, Muhammad , `Say: O mankind! If you are in doubt about the correctness of that which I have been sent with the Hanif (monotheism) religion - the religion which Allah has revealed to me -- then know that I do not worship those whom you worship besides Allah. Rather, I worship Allah alone, ascribing no partners to Him. He is the One Who causes you to die just as He gives you life. Then, unto Him is your final return. If the gods that you call upon are real, I still refuse to worship them. So call upon them and ask them to harm me, and you will see that they can bring no harm or benefit. The only One Who holds the power of harm and benefit in His Hand is Allah alone, Who has no partners.'\nوَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And I was commanded to be one of the believers.) 10:104 Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا\n(And that you direct your face towards the Hanif religion) This means to make one's intention in worship solely for Allah alone, being a Hanif. Hanif means one who turns away from associating partners with Allah. For this reason Allah says,\nوَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكَينَ\n(and not be one of the idolators. ) This statement is directly connected with the previous statement,\nوَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And I was commanded to be one of the believers.) Concerning His statement,\nوَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ\n(And if Allah touches you with harm,) This verse contains the explanation that good, evil, benefit and harm only come from Allah alone and no one shares with His power over these things. Therefore, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped alone, without ascription of partners. Concerning His statement,\nوَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(And He is the Pardoning, the Merciful.) This means that He is forgiving and merciful towards those who turn to Him in repentance, regardless of what sin the person has committed. Even if the person associated a partner with Allah, verily Allah would forgive him if he repented from it."

      "text": "Allah does not respond to the Requests for Evil like He does with the Requests for Good\nAllah tells us about His Forbearance and Benevolence with His servants. He does not respond to them when they pray with evil intentions against themselves, their wealth or their children during times of grief or anger. He knows that they do not truly intend evil for themselves so He doesn't respond to them. This is in reality kindness and mercy. On the other hand, He responds to them when they pray for themselves, wealth and money, with good, blessing and growth. Allah has said,\nوَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ الشَّرَّ اسْتِعْجَالَهُم بِالْخَيْرِ لَقُضِىَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَجَلُهُمْ\n(And were Allah to hasten for mankind the evil as He hastens for them the good then they would have been ruined.) This means that if He had responded to all of their evil requests, He would have destroyed them. However, people should avoid praying for evil as much as they can. Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded in his Musnad that Jabir said, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\n«لَا تَدْعُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ، لَا تَدْعُوا عَلَى أَوْلَادِكُمْ، لَا تَدْعُوا عَلَى أَمْوَالِكُمْ، لَا تُوَافِقُوا مِنَ اللهِ سَاعَةً فِيهَا إِجَابَةٌ فَيَسْتَجِيبَ لَكُم»\n(Do not pray against yourselves, do not pray against your children, do not pray against your wealth, for your prayer may coincide with a time of response from Allah and Allah will respond to you.) This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud. This is similar to what is understood from the following Ayah:\nوَيَدْعُ الإِنْسَـنُ بِالشَّرِّ دُعَآءَهُ بِالْخَيْرِ\n(And man invokes (Allah) for evil as he invokes (Allah) for good. )17:11 In regard to the interpretation of this Ayah,\nوَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ الشَّرَّ اسْتِعْجَالَهُم بِالْخَيْرِ\n(And were Allah to hasten for mankind the evil as He hastens for them the good) Mujahid said: \"It is the man saying to his son or money when he is angry, `O Allah don't bless him (or it) and curse him (or it).' Should Allah respond to this man in this request as He responds to him with good, He would destroy them.\""

      "text": "Man remembers Allah at Times of Adversity and forgets Him at Times of Prosperity\nAllah tells us about man and how he becomes annoyed and worried when he is touched with distress.\nوَإِذَا مَسَّهُ الشَّرُّ فَذُو دُعَآءٍ عَرِيضٍ\n(but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.)41:51 `Long supplications' also means many supplications. When man suffers adversity he becomes worried and anxious. So he supplicates more. He prays to Allah to lift and remove the adversity. He prays while standing, sitting or laying down. When Allah removes his adversity and lifts his distress, he turns away and becomes arrogant. He goes on as if nothing were wrong with him before.\nمَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ\n(He passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) Allah then criticized and condemned those who have these qualities or act this way, so He said:\nكَذلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Thus it is made fair seeming to the wasteful that which they used to do.) But those on whom Allah has bestowed good guidance and support are an exception.\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ\n(Except those who have patience believe and do righteous good deeds.) 11:11 The Prophet said:\n«عَجَبًا (لِأَمْرِ) الْمُؤْمِنِ لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ فَصَبَرَ كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ فَشَكَرَ كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا لِلْمُؤْمِن»\n(How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything and this is not the case with anyone except a believer. If prosperity attends him, he expresses gratitude to Allah, and that is good for him. And if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is also good for him.)"

This indicates that these are verses of the Qur'an, in which the wisdom of judgment is clear.\nThe Messenger cannot be but a Human Being\nAllah rebukes the attitude of the disbelievers with the words\nأَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا\n(Is it a wonder for mankind...) They have always found it strange that Allah would send Messengers to them from among mankind. Allah also tells us about other people from previous nations who said,\nأَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا\n(Shall mere men guide us) (64:6) Hud and Salih said to their people:\nأَوَ عَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْكُمْ\n(Do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you.) (7:63) Allah also told us what the disbelievers from Quraysh said:\nأَجَعَلَ الاٌّلِهَةَ إِلَـهاً وَحِداً إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عُجَابٌ\n(Has he made the gods into one God Verily, this is a curious thing!) (38:5) Ad-Dahhak reported Ibn `Abbas that he said: \"When Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ as a Messenger, most of the Arabs denied him and his message and said: Allah is greater than sending a human Messenger like Muhammad ﷺ. \" Ibn `Abbas said, \"So Allah revealed:\nأَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا\n(Is it a wonder for mankind...)\" Allah's statement;\nأَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ\n(that they shall have with their Lord the rewards of their good deeds) Scholars have differed over the meaning of the reward for the good deeds in this Ayah:\nوَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ\n(and give good news to those who believe that they shall have with their Lord the rewards of their good deeds.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah, \"Eternal happiness has been written for them.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"It is the good reward for what they have done.\" Mujahid said: \"It is their good deeds -- their prayers, fasting, charity, and glorification.\" He then said, \"And Muhammad will intercede for them.\" Allah said:\nقَالَ الْكَـفِرُونَ إِنَّ هَـذَا لَسَـحِرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n((But) the disbelievers say: \"This is indeed an evident sorcerer!\") This means that the disbelievers said this although Allah has sent a Messenger from among themselves to them, a man of their own race as a bearer of good news and as a warner. But they are the liars in saying that."

      "text": "The Idolators requested a Miracle\nThese stubborn, lying disbelievers said, \"Why would not a sign be revealed to Muhammad ﷺ from his Lord.\" They meant a sign such as given to Salih. Allah sent the she-camel to Thamud. They wanted Allah to change the mount of As-Safa into gold or remove the mountains of Makkah and replace them with gardens and rivers. Allah is capable of doing all of that, but He is All-Wise in His actions and statements. Allah said:\nتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى إِن شَآءَ جَعَلَ لَكَ خَيْراً مِّن ذلِكَ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ وَيَجْعَل لَّكَ قُصُوراً - بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالسَّاعَةِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِالسَّاعَةِ سَعِيراً\n(Blessed be He Who, if He wills, will assign you better than (all) that -- Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) and will assign you palaces (in Paradise). Nay, they deny the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour, We have prepared a flaming Fire.)25:10-11 He also said:\nوَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالاٌّيَـتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ\n(And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them.) 17:59 Allah's way of dealing with His creatures is that He would give to them if they asked things from Him. But if they then didn't believe He would expedite punishment for them. When Allah's Messenger ﷺ was given the choice of Allah giving the people what they requested but if they didn't believe they would be punished, or that their request would not be answered immediately, Allah's Messenger ﷺ chose the latter. Allah guided His Prophet to answer their question by saying:\nفَقُلْ إِنَّمَا الْغَيْبُ للَّهِ\n(Say: \"The Unseen belongs only to Allah...\") This Ayah means that the matter in its entirety is for Allah. He is well aware of the outcome of all matters.\nفَانتَظِرُواْ إِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ الْمُنتَظِرِينَ\n(\"...so wait you, verily, I am with you among those who wait.\") If you would not believe unless you witness that which you asked for, then wait for Allah's judgement for me, as well as for yourselves. Nonetheless, they had witnessed some of the signs and miracles of the Prophet , which were even greater than what they had asked for. In their presence, the Prophet pointed to the moon when it was full and it split into two parts, one part behind the mountain and the other before them. If they were seeking the guidance and firm knowledge by asking for signs, Allah would have known that and would have granted them what had been requested. But Allah knew that it was their obstinacy that was behind their request. Therefore Allah left them to suffer in their suspicion and doubt. Allah knew that none of them would believe. This is similar to Allah's statements:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ\n(Truly, those, against whom the Word (Wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them.)10:96-97 and;\nوَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ قُبُلاً مَّا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ\n(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allah willed.)6:111 This was in addition to their arrogance. As Allah said in another Ayah:\nوَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَاباً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ\n(And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven.) 15:14 And He said:\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ كِسْفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ سَـقِطاً\n(And if they were to see a piece of the heaven falling down.)52:44 He also said:\nوَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَـباً فِى قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And even if We had sent down unto you (O Muhammad) a Message written on paper so that they could touch it with their hands, the disbelievers would have said: `This is nothing but obvious magic!')6:7 Such people don't deserve to have their requests answered, for there is no benefit in answering them. These people are obstinate and stubborn as a result of their corruption and immorality. Therefore Allah told His Messenger to say:\nفَانتَظِرُواْ إِنِّى مَعَكُم مِّنَ الْمُنتَظِرِينَ\n(So wait you, verily, I am with you among those who wait.)"

      "text": "Man changes when He receives Mercy after Times of Distress\nAllah tells us that when He makes men feel His mercy after being afflicted with distress,\nإِذَا لَهُمْ مَّكْرٌ فِى ءايَـتِنَا\n(They take to plotting against Our Ayat.) The coming of mercy after distress is like the coming of ease after hardship, fertility after aridity, and rain after drought. Mujahid said that man's attitude indicates a mockery and belying of blessings. The meaning here is similar to Allah's statement:\nوَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ الضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنبِهِ أَوْ قَاعِدًا أَوْ قَآئِمًا\n(And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing.)(10:12) Al-Bukhari recorded that Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the Subh (Dawn) prayer after it had rained during the night, then he said:\n«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمُ اللَّيْلَةَ؟»\n(Do you know what your Lord has said last night) They replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" He said:\n«قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ فَذَاكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا فَذَاكَ كَافِرٌ بِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»\n(Allah said; \"This morning, some of My servants have become believers and some disbelievers in Me. He who said: `We have had this rainfall due to the grace and mercy of Allah' is a believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. And he who said `we have had this rainfall due to the rising of such and such star' is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.) The Ayah:\nقُلِ اللَّهُ أَسْرَعُ مَكْرًا\n(Say: \"Allah is more swift in planning!\") means that Allah is more capable of gradually seizing them with punishment, while granting them concession of a delay until the criminals think that they would not be punished. But in reality they are in periods of respite, then they will be taken suddenly. The noble writers (meaning the angels who write the deeds) will write everything that they do and keep count of their deeds. Then they will present it before the All-Knowing of the seen and unseen worlds. The Lord will then reward them for the significant deeds and even the seemingly insignificant that may be as tiny as a spot on a date pit. Allah further states:\nهُوَ الَّذِى يُسَيِّرُكُمْ فِى الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ\n(He it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea...) which means that He preserves you and maintains you with His care and watching.\nحَتَّى إِذَا كُنتُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ وَجَرَيْنَ بِهِم بِرِيحٍ طَيِّبَةٍ وَفَرِحُواْ بِهَا\n(Till when you are in the ships, and they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they are glad therein...) meaning smoothly and calmly;\nجَآءَتْهَا\n(then comes (these ships))\nرِيحٌ عَاصِفٌ\n(a stormy wind)\nوَجَآءَهُمُ الْمَوْجُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\no(and the waves come to them from all sides, )\nوَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ أُحِيطَ بِهِمْ\n(and they think that they are encircled therein) meaning that are going to be destroyed.\nدَعَوُاْ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ\n(Then they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him (alone)) meaning that in this situation they would not invoke an idol or statue besides Allah. They would single Him out alone for their supplications and prayers. This is similar to Allah's statement:\nوَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا نَجَّـكُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ وَكَانَ الإِنْسَـنُ كَفُورًا\n(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him (Allah alone). But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ever ungrateful.) 17:67 And in this Surah, He says:\nدَعَوُاْ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ لَئِنْ أَنْجَيْتَنَا مِنْ هَـذِهِ\n(They invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him (saying): \"If You (Allah) deliver us from this (situation).\")\nلَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّـكِرِينَ\n(\"We shall truly, be of the grateful.\") This means that we will not ascribe others as partners with You. We will later worship You alone as we are praying to You here and now. Allah states;\nفَلَمَّآ أَنجَاهُمْ\n(But when He delivers them) from that distress,\nإِذَا هُمْ يَبْغُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ\n(behold! They rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth wrongfully...) meaning: they returned as if they had never experienced any difficulties and had never promised Him anything. So Allah said:\nكَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ\n(He passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!)10:12 Allah then said:\nيأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّمَا بَغْيُكُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ\n(O mankind! Your rebellion (disobedience to Allah) is only against yourselves,) it is you yourselves that will taste the evil consequence of this transgression.

Allah's statement:\nمَّتَاعَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا\n(a brief enjoyment of this worldly life...) means that you only have a short enjoyment in this low and abased worldly life.\nثُمَّ إِلَينَا مَرْجِعُكُمْ\n(then (in the end) unto Us is your return...) meaning your goal and final destination.\nفَنُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(and We shall inform you) of all your deeds. Then we shall recompense you for them. So let him who finds good (in his record) praise Allah, and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself."

They rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth wrongfully...) meaning: they returned as if they had never experienced any difficulties and had never promised Him anything. So Allah said:\nكَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَى ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ\n(He passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!)10:12 Allah then said:\nيأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّمَا بَغْيُكُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ\n(O mankind! Your rebellion (disobedience to Allah) is only against yourselves,) it is you yourselves that will taste the evil consequence of this transgression. You will not harm anyone else with it, as comes in the Hadith,\n«مَا مِنْ ذَنْبٍ أَجْدَرَ أَنْ يُعَجِّلَ اللهُ عُقُوبَتَهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعَ مَا يَدَّخِرُ اللهُ لِصَاحِبِهِ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْبَغْيِ وَقَطِيعَةِ الرَّحِم»\n(There is no sin that is more worthy that Allah hasten punishment for in this world -- on top of the punishment that Allah has in store for it in the Hereafter -- than oppression and cutting the ties of the womb.) Allah's statement:\nمَّتَاعَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا\n(a brief enjoyment of this worldly life...) means that you only have a short enjoyment in this low and abased worldly life.\nثُمَّ إِلَينَا مَرْجِعُكُمْ\n(then (in the end) unto Us is your return...) meaning your goal and final destination.\nفَنُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(and We shall inform you) of all your deeds. Then we shall recompense you for them. So let him who finds good (in his record) praise Allah, and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself."

This plant grows from the water that comes down from the sky. These plants are food for people, such as fruits and other different types and kinds of foods. Some other kinds are food for cattle such as clover plants (i.e. green fodder for the cattle) and herbage etc.\nحَتَّى إِذَآ أَخَذَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا\n(until when the earth is clad in its adornments ,)\nوَازَّيَّنَتْ\n(and is beautified ) meaning, it became good by what grows on its hills such as blooming flowers of different shapes and colors.\nوَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَآ\n(and its people think...) those who planted it and put it in the ground,\nأَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَآ\n(that they have all the powers of disposal over it) to cultivate it and harvest it. But while they were in that frame of mind, a thunderbolt or a severe, cold storm came to it. It dried its leaves and spoiled its fruits. Allah said:\nأَتَاهَآ أَمْرُنَا لَيْلاً أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيدًا\n(Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, ) it became dry after it was green and flourishing.\nكَأَن لَّمْ تَغْنَ بِالاٌّمْسِ\n(as if it had not flourished yesterday!) as if nothing existed there before. Qatadah said: \"As if it had not flourished; as if it was never blessed.\" Such are things after they perish, they are as if they had never existed. Similarly, the Hadith,\n«يُؤْتَى بِأَنْعَمِ أَهْلِ الدُّنْيَا، فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّارِ غَمْسَةً، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ خَيْرًا قَطُّ؟ هَلْ مَرَّ بِكَ نَعِيمٌ قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا، وَيُؤْتَى بِأَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّعِيمِ غَمْسَةً، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ بُؤْسًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ لَا»\n(A person who led the most prosperous life in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the Fire. He will then be asked: `Have you ever found any good or comfort' He will reply: `No.' And a person who had experienced extreme adversity in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the bliss (of Paradise). Then he will be asked: 'Did you ever face any hardship or misery' He will reply: `No.') Allah said about those who were destroyed:\nفَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَكَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ\n(So they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes; as if they had never lived there.)11:67-68 Allah then said:\nكَذلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ\n(Thus do We explain the Ayat. ..) We do explain the proofs, and evidences, in detail\nلِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ\n(for the people who reflect.) so they may take a lesson from this example in the swift vanishing of this world from its people while they are deceived by it. They would trust this world and its promises, and then it unexpectedly turns away from them. This world, in its nature, runs away from those who seek it but seeks those who run away from it. Allah mentioned the parable of this world and the plants of the earth in several Ayat in His Noble Book. He said in Surat Al-Kahf:\nوَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنْزَلْنَـهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الاٌّرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ الرِّياحُ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا\n(And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is able to do everything.) (18:45) He also gave similar examples in both Surat Az-Zumar 39:21 and Surat Al-Hadid 57:20.\nInvitation to the Everlasting Gifts that do not vanish\nAllah said:\nوَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَى دَارِ السَّلاَمِ\n(And Allah calls to the Abode of Peace) When Allah mentioned the swiftness of this world and its termination, He invited people to Paradise and encouraged them to seek it. He called it the Abode of Peace. It is the Abode of Peace because it is free from defects and miseries. So Allah said:\nوَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَى دَارِ السَّلاَمِ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(Allah calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He wills to the straight path.) It was narrated that Jabir bin `Abdullah said: \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ came out one day and said to us:\n«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ فِي الْمَنَامِ كَأَنَّ جِبْرِيلَ عِنْدَ رَأْسِي، وَمِيكَائِيلَ عِنْدَ رِجْلَيَّ، يَقُولُ أَحَدُهُمَا لِصَاحِبِهِ: اضْرِبْ لَهُ مَثَلًا، فَقَالَ: اسْمَعْ، سَمِعَتْ أُذُنُكَ، وَاعْقِلْ، عَقَلَ قَلْبُكَ، إِنَّمَا مَثَلُكَ وَمَثَلُ أُمَّتِكَ كَمَثَلِ مَلِكٍ اتَّخَذَ دَارًا، ثُمَّ بَنَى فِيهَا بَيْتًا، ثُمَّ جَعَلَ فِيهَا مَأْدَبةً، ثُمَّ بَعَثَ رَسُولًا يَدْعُو النَّاسَ إِلَى طَعَامِهِ، فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ أَجَابَ الرَّسُولَ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ تَرَكَهُ، فَاللهُ الْمَلِكُ، وَالدَّارُ الْإِسْلَامُ، وَالْبَيْتُ الْجَنَّةُ، وَأَنْتَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ رَسُولٌ، فَمَنْ أَجَابَكَ دَخَلَ الْإِسْلَامَ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْإِسْلَامَ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ أَكَلَ مِنْهَا»\n(I have seen in my sleep that it was as if Jibril was at my head and Mika'il at my leg. They were saying to each other: `Give an example for him.' He said: `Listen, your ear may listen. And fathom, your heart may fathom. The parable of you and your Ummah is that of a king who has built a house on his land. He arranged a banquet in it. Then he sent a messenger to invite the people to his food. Some accepted the invitation and others did not. Allah is the King and the land is Islam, the house is Paradise and you Muhammad are the Messenger. Whosoever responds to your call enters Islam. And whosoever enters Islam enters Paradise. And whosoever enters Paradise eats from it.) Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith. It was also reported that Abu Ad-Darda' said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\n«مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ الشَّمْسُ إِلَّا وَبِجَنْبَيْهَا مَلَكَانِ يُنَادِيَانِ يَسْمَعُهُ خَلْقُ اللهِ كُلُّهُمْ إِلَّا الثَّقَلَيْنِ: يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هَلُمُّوا إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ، إِنَّ مَا قَلَّ وَكَفَى خَيْرٌ مِمَّا كَثُرَ وَأَلْهَى»\n(Two angels descend every day in which the sun rises and say that which all Allah's creatures would hear except Jinn and humans: `O people! Come to your Lord! Anything little and sufficient is better than a lot but distractive.') And He sent this down in the Qur'an when He said:\nوَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَى دَارِ السَّلاَمِ\n(\"Allah calls to the Abode of Peace\".) Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this."

      "text": "The Reward of the Good-Doers\nAllah states that those who do good in this world -- by having faith and performing righteous deeds -- will be rewarded with a good reward in the Hereafter. Allah said:\nهَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ\n(Is there any reward for good other than good)(55:60) Then Allah said:\nوَزِيَادَةٌ\n(and even more.) the reward on the good deeds multiplied ten times to seven hundred times and even more on top of that. This reward includes what Allah will give them in Paradise, such as the palaces, Al-Hur (virgins of Paradise), and His pleasure upon them. He will give them what He has hidden for them of the delight of the eye. He will grant them on top of all of that and even better, the honor of looking at His Noble Face. This is the increase that is greater than anything that had been given. They will not deserve that because of their deeds, but rather, they will receive it by the grace of Allah and His mercy. The explanation that this refers to looking at Allah's Noble Face was narrated from Abu Bakr, Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Amir bin Sa`ad, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq, and others from the earlier and later scholars. There are many Hadiths that contain the same interpretation. Among these Hadiths is what Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah,\nلِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ\n(For those who have done good is the best and even more.) And then he said:\n«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ وَأَهْلُ النَّارِ النَّارَ نَادَى مُنَادٍ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللهِ مَوْعِدًا يُريدُ أَنْ يُنْجِزَكُمُوهُ فَيَقُولُونَ: وَمَا هُوَ؟ أَلَمْ يُثَقِّلْ مَوَازِينَنَا؟ أَلَمْ يُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا وَيُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّــةَ وَيُجِرْنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ فَيَكْشِفُ لَهُمُ الْحِجَابَ، فَيَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيهِ، فَوَاللهِ مَا أَعْطَاهُمْ اللهُ شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَيْهِ، وَلَا أَقَرَّ لِأَعْيُنِهِم»\n(When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, a caller will say: `O people of Paradise, Allah has promised you something that He wishes to fulfill.' They will reply: `What is it Has He not made our Scale heavy Has He not made our faces white and delivered us from Fire' Allah will then remove the veil and they will see Him. By Allah, they have not been given anything dearer to them and more delightful than looking at Him.) Muslim and a group of Imams also related this Hadith. Allah then said:\nوَلاَ يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ\n(Neither darkness nor dust shall cover their faces. ..) meaning, no blackness or darkness will be on their faces during the different events of the Day of Judgment. But the faces of the rebellious disbelievers will be stained with dust and darkness.\nوَلاَ ذِلَّةٌ\n(nor any humiliating disgrace) meaning, they will be covered with degradation and disgrace. The believers, however will not be humiliated internally or externally, on the contrary, they will be protected and honored. For as Allah has said:\nفَوَقَـهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَومِ وَلَقَّـهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً\n(So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah (brightness) and joy.) 76:11 meaning, light in their faces and delight in their hearts. May Allah make us among those by His grace and mercy."

He told us about His justice with them. He will reward them with similar evil, without any increase\nوَتَرْهَقُهُمْ\n(and will cover them) meaning that their faces will be covered and overtaken by humiliation because of their sins and their fear from these sins. Similarly Allah said:\nوَتَرَاهُمْ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا خَـشِعِينَ مِنَ الذُّلِّ\n(And you will see them brought forward to it, (Hell) made humble by disgrace.)42:45 He also said:\nوَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِى رُءُوسِهِمْ\n(Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror. (They will be) hastening forward with necks outstretched, their heads raised up (towards the sky).)14:42 - 43 Allah then said:\nمَّا لَهُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ\n(No defender will they have from Allah.) meaning, there will be no protectors to prevent them from punishment as Allah said:\nيَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ - كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ\n(On that Day man will say: \"Where (is the refuge) to flee\" No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord (alone) will be the place of rest that Day.)75:10-12 Allah's statement:\nكَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ\n(Their faces will be covered as it were...) means that their faces will be dark in the Hereafter. This is similar to His statement:\nيَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ اسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكْفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ - وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ابْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِى رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ\n(On the Day (the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black; as for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): \"Did you reject faith after accepting it Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting faith.\" And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in Allah's mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.)3:106-107 He also said:\nوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ - ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ - وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ\n(Some faces that Day will be bright, laughing, rejoicing at good news (of Paradise). And other faces that Day will be dust-stained. )80:38-40"

      "text": "Allah is the Creator Who arranges the Affairs of the Universe\nAllah tells us that He is the Lord of the entire existence. He tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in six days. It was said: \"Like these days (meaning our worldly days).\" It was also said: \"Every day is like a thousand years of what we reckon.\" Later, this will be discussed further.\nثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ\n(and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne.)\" The Throne is the greatest of the creatures and is like a ceiling for them. Allah's statement:\nيُدَبِّرُ الاٌّمْرَ\n(arranging the affair of all things.) means that He controls the affairs of the creatures.\nلاَ يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَلاَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Not even the weight of a speck of dust escapes His Knowledge in the heavens or in the earth.) (34:3) No affair distract' Him from other affairs. No matter troubles Him. The persistent requests of His creatures do not annoy Him. He governs big things as He governs small things everywhere, on the mountains, in the oceans, in populated areas, or in wastelands.\nوَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا\n(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah.) (11:6)\nوَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.) (6:59) Ad-Darawardi narrated from Sa`d bin Ishaq bin Ka`b bin `Ujrah that he said: \"When this Ayah was revealed,\nإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ\n(Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth) they met a great caravan whom they thought should be Arabs. They said to them: `Who are you' They replied: `We are Jinns. We left Al-Madinah because of this Ayah.\"' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah said:\nمَا مِن شَفِيعٍ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِ\n(No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after He permits.) This is similar to what is in the following Ayat:\nمَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ\n(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) (2:255) and,\nوَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى\n(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.)(53:26), and;\nوَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ\n(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. )(34:23). Allah then said:\nذلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ\n(That is Allah, your Lord; so worship Him (alone). Then, will you not remember) meaning worship Him alone with no partners.\nأَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ\n(Then will you not remember) meaning \"O idolators, you worship gods with Allah while you know that He alone is the Creator,\" as He said:\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")(43:87),\nقُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ\nسَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ\n(\"Say: \"Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne They will say: \"Allah.\" Say: \"Will you not then have Taqwa\") (23:86-87), Similar is mentioned in the Ayah before this Ayah and after it."

      "text": "The Qur'an is the True, Inimitable Word of Allah and It is a Miracle\nThe Qur'an has a miraculous nature that cannot be imitated. No one can produce anything similar to the Qur'an, nor ten Surahs or even one Surah like it. The eloquence, clarity, precision and grace of the Qur'an cannot be but from Allah. The great and abundant principles and meanings within the Qur'an -- which are of great benefit in this world and for the Hereafter -- cannot be but from Allah. There is nothing like His High Self and Attributes or like His sayings and actions. Therefore His Words are not like the words of His creatures. This is why Allah said:\nوَمَا كَانَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ أَن يُفْتَرَى مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ\n(And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah) meaning, a book like this cannot be but from Allah. This is not similar to the speech uttered by humans.\nوَلَـكِن تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it,) Such as previous revelations and Books. The Qur'an confirms these books and is a witness to them. It shows the changes, perversions and corruption that have taken place within these Books. Then Allah said,\nوَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(and a full explanation of the Book -- wherein there is no doubt -- from the Lord of all that exists.) That is, fully and truly explaining and detailing the rules and the lawful and the unlawful. With this complete and more than sufficient explanation, the Qur'an leaves no doubt that it is from Allah, the Lord of all that exists. Allah says,\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or do they say: \"He has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\") If you argue, claim and doubt whether this is from Allah then you uttered a lie and blasphemy, and you say it is from Muhammad -- Muhammad , however is a man like you, and since he came as you claim with this Qur'an -- then you produce a Surah like one of its Surahs. Produce something of the same nature and seek help and support with all the power you have from humans and Jinns. This is the third stage, Allah challenged them and called them to produce a counterpart of the Qur'an if they were truthful in their claim that it was simply from Muhammad . Allah even suggested that they seek help from anyone they chose. But He told them that they would not be able to do it. They would have no way of doing so. Allah said:\nقُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا\n(Say: \"If the mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\") 17:88 Then He reduced the number for them to ten Surahs similar to it, in the beginning of Surah Hud, Allah said:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or they say, \"He forged it.\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surah like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if you speak the truth!\")11:13 In this Surah He went even further to challenge them to produce only one Surah like unto the Qur'an. So He said:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or do they say: \"He has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\") 10:38 He also challenged them in Surat Al-Baqarah, a Madinite Surah, to produce one Surah similar to it. He stated in that Surah that they would never be capable of doing so, saying:\nفَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ\n(But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell).)2:24 It should be noted here that eloquence was a part of the nature and character of the Arabs. Arabic poetry including Al-Mu`allaqat -- the oldest complete collection of the most eloquent ancient Arabic poems -- was considered to be the best in the literary arts. However Allah sent down to them something whose style none were familiar with, and no one is equal in stature to imitate. So those who believed among them, believed because of what they knew and felt in the Book, including its beauty, elegance, benefit, and fluency. They became the most knowledgeable of the Qur'an and its best in adhering to it. The same thing happened to the magicians during Fir`awn's time. They were knowledgeable of the arts of sorcery, however, when Musa performed his miracles, they knew that it must have come through someone that was supported and guided by Allah. They knew that no human could perform such acts without the permission of Allah. Similarly, `Isa was sent at the time of scholarly medicine and during the advancement in the treatment of patients. He healed the blind, lepers and raised the dead to life by Allah's leave. What `Isa was able to do was such that no form of treatment or medicine could reproduce. As a result, those who believed in him knew that he was Allah's servant and His Messenger. Similarly, in the Sahih, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآيَاتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا»\n(There was never a Prophet but he was given signs by which the people would recognize him, and that which I was given is revelation that Allah revealed, so I hope that I will have the most followers among them.)

Allah's statement,\nوَمِنهُمْ مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ\n(And of them there are some who believe therein;) means that among those you were sent to, O Muhammad, are people who will believe in this Qur'an, follow you and benefit from what has been sent to you.\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ\n(and of them there are some who believe not therein,) but dies as a disbeliever and will be resurrected as such.\nوَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(And your Lord is All-Aware of the mischief makers. ) He best knows those who deserve guidance, so He guides them, and those who deserve to go astray, He allows to go astray. Allah is, however, the Just who is never unjust. He gives everyone what they deserve. All Glory is His, the Exalted. There is no God but He."

      "text": "The Qur'an is the True, Inimitable Word of Allah and It is a Miracle\nThe Qur'an has a miraculous nature that cannot be imitated. No one can produce anything similar to the Qur'an, nor ten Surahs or even one Surah like it. The eloquence, clarity, precision and grace of the Qur'an cannot be but from Allah. The great and abundant principles and meanings within the Qur'an -- which are of great benefit in this world and for the Hereafter -- cannot be but from Allah. There is nothing like His High Self and Attributes or like His sayings and actions. Therefore His Words are not like the words of His creatures. This is why Allah said:\nوَمَا كَانَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ أَن يُفْتَرَى مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ\n(And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah) meaning, a book like this cannot be but from Allah. This is not similar to the speech uttered by humans.\nوَلَـكِن تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it,) Such as previous revelations and Books. The Qur'an confirms these books and is a witness to them. It shows the changes, perversions and corruption that have taken place within these Books. Then Allah said,\nوَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(and a full explanation of the Book -- wherein there is no doubt -- from the Lord of all that exists.) That is, fully and truly explaining and detailing the rules and the lawful and the unlawful. With this complete and more than sufficient explanation, the Qur'an leaves no doubt that it is from Allah, the Lord of all that exists. Allah says,\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or do they say: \"He has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\") If you argue, claim and doubt whether this is from Allah then you uttered a lie and blasphemy, and you say it is from Muhammad -- Muhammad , however is a man like you, and since he came as you claim with this Qur'an -- then you produce a Surah like one of its Surahs. Produce something of the same nature and seek help and support with all the power you have from humans and Jinns. This is the third stage, Allah challenged them and called them to produce a counterpart of the Qur'an if they were truthful in their claim that it was simply from Muhammad . Allah even suggested that they seek help from anyone they chose. But He told them that they would not be able to do it. They would have no way of doing so. Allah said:\nقُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا\n(Say: \"If the mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\") 17:88 Then He reduced the number for them to ten Surahs similar to it, in the beginning of Surah Hud, Allah said:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or they say, \"He forged it.\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surah like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if you speak the truth!\")11:13 In this Surah He went even further to challenge them to produce only one Surah like unto the Qur'an. So He said:\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Or do they say: \"He has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\") 10:38 He also challenged them in Surat Al-Baqarah, a Madinite Surah, to produce one Surah similar to it. He stated in that Surah that they would never be capable of doing so, saying:\nفَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ\n(But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell).)2:24 It should be noted here that eloquence was a part of the nature and character of the Arabs. Arabic poetry including Al-Mu`allaqat -- the oldest complete collection of the most eloquent ancient Arabic poems -- was considered to be the best in the literary arts. However Allah sent down to them something whose style none were familiar with, and no one is equal in stature to imitate. So those who believed among them, believed because of what they knew and felt in the Book, including its beauty, elegance, benefit, and fluency. They became the most knowledgeable of the Qur'an and its best in adhering to it. The same thing happened to the magicians during Fir`awn's time. They were knowledgeable of the arts of sorcery, however, when Musa performed his miracles, they knew that it must have come through someone that was supported and guided by Allah. They knew that no human could perform such acts without the permission of Allah. Similarly, `Isa was sent at the time of scholarly medicine and during the advancement in the treatment of patients. He healed the blind, lepers and raised the dead to life by Allah's leave. What `Isa was able to do was such that no form of treatment or medicine could reproduce. As a result, those who believed in him knew that he was Allah's servant and His Messenger. Similarly, in the Sahih, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآيَاتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا»\n(There was never a Prophet but he was given signs by which the people would recognize him, and that which I was given is revelation that Allah revealed, so I hope that I will have the most followers among them.) Allah then said:\nبَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُواْ بِعِلْمِهِ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ\n(Nay, they have belied the knowledge whereof they could not comprehend and what has not yet been fulfilled. ) They did not believe in the Qur'an and they have not yet grasped it or comprehended it.\nوَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ\n(And what has not yet been fulfilled.) They have not attained the guidance and the true religion.

Allah then said:\nبَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُواْ بِعِلْمِهِ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ\n(Nay, they have belied the knowledge whereof they could not comprehend and what has not yet been fulfilled. ) They did not believe in the Qur'an and they have not yet grasped it or comprehended it.\nوَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ\n(And what has not yet been fulfilled.) They have not attained the guidance and the true religion. So they belied it out of ignorance and foolishness.\nكَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ\n(Those before them did belie.) meaning, the past nations,\nفَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Then see what was the end of the wrongdoers!) Look at how we Destroyed them because they denied Our Messengers in their wickedness, pride, stubbornness and ignorance. So beware you who deny the message that the same end will befall you. Allah's statement,\nوَمِنهُمْ مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ\n(And of them there are some who believe therein;) means that among those you were sent to, O Muhammad, are people who will believe in this Qur'an, follow you and benefit from what has been sent to you.\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ\n(and of them there are some who believe not therein,) but dies as a disbeliever and will be resurrected as such.\nوَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(And your Lord is All-Aware of the mischief makers. ) He best knows those who deserve guidance, so He guides them, and those who deserve to go astray, He allows to go astray. Allah is, however, the Just who is never unjust. He gives everyone what they deserve. All Glory is His, the Exalted. There is no God but He."

He does all of that yet He is always Just, for He is the Ruler and has full authority over His kingdom. He does whatever He wills without any restrictions. No one can question Him as to what He does while he will question everyone else. He is Omniscient, All-Wise, and All-Just. So Allah said:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا وَلَـكِنَّ النَّاسَ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ\n(Truly, Allah wrongs not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves.) In the Hadith narrated by Abu Dharr, he states that the Prophet related that His Lord, Exalted and High is He, said:\n«يَا عِبَادِي إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الظُّلْمَ عَلَى نَفْسِي وَجَعَلْتُهُ بَيْنَكُمْ مُحَرَّمًا فَلَا تَظَالَمُوا»\n(O My servant!

It is but your deeds that I reckon for you and then recompense you for. So let him who finds good (in the Hereafter) praise Allah. And let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.)

This is similar to the Ayah:\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers.)77:15 Woe to them because they will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.

      "text": "Everything is a Witness to the Power of Allah\nAllah tells us about the signs He created that are indicative of His complete power and great might. He made the rays that come forth from the bright sun as the source of light, and made the beams that come forth from the moon as light. He made them of two different natures so they would not be confused with one another. Allah made the dominion of the sun in the daytime and the moon in the night. He ordained phases for the moon, where it starts small then its light increases until it completes a full moon. Then it begins to decrease until it returns to its first phase at the conclusion of the month. Allah said:\nوَالْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَـهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّى عَادَ كَالعُرجُونِ الْقَدِيمِ - لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ\n(And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.) (36:39-40) And He said:\nوَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً\n(And the sun and the moon for counting) And in this Ayah He said:\nوَقَدَّرَهُ\n(and measured) that is the moon, Allah said:\nمَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُواْ عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ\n(And measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. \") The days are revealed by the action of the sun, and the months and the years by the moon. Allah then stated\nمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ ذَلِكَ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Allah did not create this but in truth.) He didn't create that for amusement but with great wisdom and perfect reasoning. With a similar meaning, Allah said:\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) (38:27) He also said:\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(\"Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us\" So Exalted be Allah, the True King: None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah said:\nيُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(He explains the Ayat in detail for people who have knowledge.) In other words, He explained the signs and proofs for people who know. Allah further stated:\nإِنَّ فِى اخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ\n(Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day) The day and the night alternate, when one arrives, the other goes, and so on, with no errors. This is similar to the meaning indicated in the following Ayat:\nيُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا\n(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly...).\nلاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ\n(It is not for the sun to overtake the moon.) 36:40, and\nفَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً\n((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak. He has appointed the night for resting). 6:96 Allah continued:\nوَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth) meaning the signs that indicate His greatness. This is similar to Allah's statements:\nوَكَأَيِّن مِّن ءَايَةٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth...) 12:105,\nقُلِ انظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(\"Say: \"Behold all that is in the heavens and the earth,\" but neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)10:101\nأَفَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَى مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(See they not what is before them and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth.) 34:9.\nإِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لاّيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n(Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.) 3:190 means intelligent men. Allah said here,\nلآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ\n(Ayat for those who have Taqwa.) meaning fear Allah's punishment, wrath and torment."

This is why Allah instructed His Messenger to answer them saying:\nقُل لاَّ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِى ضَرًّا وَلاَ نَفْعًا\n(Say: \"I have no power over any harm or profit to myself.\") 10:49, 7:188 I will not say except what He has taught me. I also have no authority over anything that Allah has not shown to me. I am Allah's servant and His Messenger to you. I was told that the Hour is going to come, but He has not told me when it will occur. But,\nلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ\n(For every Ummah, there is a term appointed;) meaning that for every generation or community there is a set term appointed for them. When the end of that term approaches,\nفَلاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ\n(neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment). ) This is similar to what Allah said in another Ayah:\nوَلَن يُؤَخِّرَ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهَآ\n(And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes.) 63:11 Allah instructed His Messenger to tell the people that His punishment would come suddenly. He said:\nقُلْ أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُهُ بَيَاتًا أَوْ نَهَارًا مَّاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ - أَثُمَّ إِذَا مَا وَقَعَ ءَامَنْتُمْ بِهِ ءَآلْنَ وَقَدْ كُنتُم بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ\n(Say: \"Tell me, if His torment should come to you by night or by day, which portion thereof would the criminals hasten on Is it then that when it has actually befallen, you will believe in it What! Now (you believe) And you used (aforetime) to hasten it on!\") When the punishment befalls them, they will say:\nرَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا\n(\"Our Lord! We have now seen and heard.\") (32:12) Allah also said:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَـفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ - فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَـنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ الْكَـفِرُونَ\n(So when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as (His) partners. Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants. And there the disbelievers lost utterly (when Our torment covered them).\")40:84-85\nثُمَّ قِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْخُلْدِ\n(Then it will be said to them who wronged themselves: \"Taste you the everlasting torment!\") This will be said to them on the Day of Resurrection, blaming and rebuking them. As Allah said in another Ayah:\nيَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ - أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ - اصْلَوْهَا فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire that you used to belie. Is this magic or do you not see Taste you therein its heat and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same. You are only being requited for what you used to do.) 52:13-16"

He made the rays that come forth from the bright sun as the source of light, and made the beams that come forth from the moon as light. He made them of two different natures so they would not be confused with one another. Allah made the dominion of the sun in the daytime and the moon in the night. He ordained phases for the moon, where it starts small then its light increases until it completes a full moon. Then it begins to decrease until it returns to its first phase at the conclusion of the month. Allah said:\nوَالْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَـهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّى عَادَ كَالعُرجُونِ الْقَدِيمِ - لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ\n(And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk.

(36:39-40) And He said:\nوَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً\n(And the sun and the moon for counting) And in this Ayah He said:\nوَقَدَّرَهُ\n(and measured) that is the moon, Allah said:\nمَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُواْ عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ\n(And measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. \") The days are revealed by the action of the sun, and the months and the years by the moon. Allah then stated\nمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ ذَلِكَ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ\n(Allah did not create this but in truth.) He didn't create that for amusement but with great wisdom and perfect reasoning. With a similar meaning, Allah said:\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) (38:27) He also said:\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(\"Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us\" So Exalted be Allah, the True King: None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah said:\nيُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(He explains the Ayat in detail for people who have knowledge.) In other words, He explained the signs and proofs for people who know. Allah further stated:\nإِنَّ فِى اخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ\n(Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day) The day and the night alternate, when one arrives, the other goes, and so on, with no errors. This is similar to the meaning indicated in the following Ayat:\nيُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا\n(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly...).\nلاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ\n(It is not for the sun to overtake the moon.) 36:40, and\nفَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً\n((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak. He has appointed the night for resting). 6:96 Allah continued:\nوَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth) meaning the signs that indicate His greatness. This is similar to Allah's statements:\nوَكَأَيِّن مِّن ءَايَةٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth...) 12:105,\nقُلِ انظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِى الآيَـتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(\"Say: \"Behold all that is in the heavens and the earth,\" but neither Ayat nor warners benefit those who believe not.)10:101\nأَفَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَى مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ\n(See they not what is before them and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth.) 34:9.\nإِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لاّيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى الاٌّلْبَـبِ\n(Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.) 3:190 means intelligent men. Allah said here,\nلآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ\n(Ayat for those who have Taqwa.) meaning fear Allah's punishment, wrath and torment."

      "text": "None can make Anything Lawful or Unlawful except Allah or Those Whom Allah has allowed to do so\nIbn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others said: \"This Ayah was revealed to criticize the idolators for what they used to make lawful and unlawful. Like the Bahirah, Sa'ibah and Wasilah.\" As Allah said:\nوَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً\n(And they assign to Allah a share of the tilth and cattle which He has created.)6:136 Imam Ahmad recorded a narration from Malik bin Nadlah who said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger while in filthy clothes. He said,\n«هَلْ لَكَ مَالٌ؟»\n(Do you have wealth) I answered, `Yes.' He said,\n«مِنْ أَيِّ الْمَالِ؟»\n(what kind of wealth) I answered, `All kinds; camels, slaves, horses, sheep.' So he said,\n«إِذَا آَتَاكَ اللَّهُ مَالًا فَلْيُرَ عَلَيْك»\n(If Allah gives you wealth, then let it be seen on you.) Then he said,\n«هَلْ تُنْتَجُ إِبْلُكَ صِحَاحًا آذَانُهَا، فَتَعْمِدَ إِلَى مُوسًى فَتَقْطَعَ آذَانَهَا، فَتَقُولُ: هَذِهِ بُحْرٌ، وَتَشُقُّ جُلُودَهَا وَتَقُولُ: هَذِهِ صُرُمٌ، وَتُحَرِّمُهَا عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَى أَهْلِك»\n؟ (It is not that your camels are born with healthy ears, you take a knife and cut them, then say, \"This is a Bahr,\" tear its skin, then say, `This is a Sarm,\" and prohibit them for yourself and your family) I replied, `Yes.' He said,\n«فَإِنَّ مَا آتَاكَ اللهُ لَكَ حِلٌّ، سَاعِدُ اللهِ أَشَدُّ مِنْ سَاعِدِكَ، وَمُوسَى الله أَحَدُ مِنْ مُوسَاك»\n(What Allah has given you is lawful. Allah's Forearm is stronger than your forearm, and Allah's knife is sharper then your knife.)\" And he mentioned the Hadith in its complete form, and the chain for this Hadith is a strong, good chain. Allah criticized those who make lawful what Allah has made unlawful or vice verse. This is because they are based on mere desires and false opinions that are not supported with evidence or proof. Allah then warned them with a promise of the Day of Resurrection. He asked:\nوَمَا ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ\n(And what think those who invent a lie against Allah, on the Day of Resurrection) What do they think will happen to them when they return to Us on the Day of Resurrection Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ\n(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind,) indicated that the bounty is in postponing their punishment in this world. I (Ibn Kathir) say, the meaning could be that the Grace for people is in the good benefits that He made permissible for them in this world or in their religion. He also has not prohibited them except what is harmful to them in their world and the Hereafter.\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ\n(but most of them are ungrateful.) So they prohibited what Allah has bestowed upon them and made it hard and narrow upon themselves. They made some things lawful and others unlawful. The idolators committed these actions when they set laws for themselves. And so did the People of the Book when they invented innovations in their religion."

      "text": "Everything Small or Large is within the Knowledge of Allah\nAllah informed His Prophet that He knows and is well acquainted with all of the affairs and conditions of him and his Ummah and all of creation and its creatures at all times -- during every hour and second. Nothing slips or escapes from His knowledge and observation, not even anything the weight of a speck of dust within the heavens or earth, or anything that is smaller or larger than that. Everything is in a manifest Book, as Allah said:\nوَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden and unseen), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.)(6:59) He stated that He is Well-Aware of the movement of the trees and other inanimate objects. He is also Well-Aware of all grazing beasts. He said:\nوَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ\n(There is not a moving creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you.) (6:38) He also said:\nوَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا\n(And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. )(11:6) If this is His knowledge of the movement of these things, then what about His knowledge of the movement of the creatures that are commanded to worship Him Allah said:\nوَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ - الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ\n(And put your trust in the Almighty, the Most Merciful, Who sees you when you stand up, and your movements among those who fall prostrate.)(26:217-219) That is why Allah said:\nوَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ\n(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof when you are doing it.) meaning, `We are watching and hearing you when you engage in that thing.' When Jibril asked the Prophet about Ihsan, he said:\n«أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك»\n(It is that you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him. But since you do not see Him, be certain that He is watching you.)"

It was said: \"Who are these, O Messenger of Allah, so we may love them\" He said:\n«هُمْ قَوْمٌ تَحَابُّوا فِي اللهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَمْوَالٍ وَلَا أَنْسَابٍ، وُجُوهُهُمْ نُورٌ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ، لَا يَخَافُون إِذَا خَافَ النَّاسُ، وَلَا يَحْزَنُونَ إِذَا حَزِنَ النَّاس»\n(These are people who loved one another for the sake of Allah without any other interest like money or kinship.

But what is the good news in this world\" He said:\n«الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يَرَاهَا الْعَبْدُ أَوْ تُرَى لَهُ. وَهِيَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ أَرْبَعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا أَوْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة»\n(It is the good dream that a servant may see or it is seen about him. This dream is one part from forty-four or seventy parts of Prophethood.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What about a man who does deeds that the people commend him for\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«تِلْكَ عَاجِلُ بُشْرَى الْمُؤْمِن»\n(That is the good news that has been expedited for the believer.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\nلَهُمُ الْبُشْرَى فِي الْحَيوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(For them is good news, in the life of the present world) Then he said,\n«الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يُبَشَّرُهَا الْمُؤْمِنُ، جُزْءٌ مِنْ تِسْعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّةِ، فَمَنْ رَأَى ذَلِكَ فَلْيُخْبِرْ بِهَا،وَمَنْ رَأَى سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ لِيُحْزِنَهُ، فَلْيَنْفُثْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلَاثًا، وَلْيُكَبِّرْ، وَلَا يُخْبِرْ بِهَا أَحَدًا»\n(The good dream that comes as a good news for the believer is a part of forty-nine parts of prophethood. So if anyone of you has a good dream, he should narrate it to others. But if he has a dream that he dislikes, then it is from Shaytan to make him sad. He should blow to his left three times, and say : \"Allahu Akbar,\" and should not mention it to anyone.\") And it was also said, \"The good news here is the glad tidings the angels bring to the believer at the time of death. They bring him the good news of Paradise and forgiveness.\" Similarly, Allah said:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ\n(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah (alone),\" and then they stand straight and firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) In the Hadith narrated by Al-Bara', the Prophet said:\nإِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ إِذَا حَضَرَهُ الْمُوتُ جَاءَهُ مَلَائِكَةٌ بِيضُ الْوُجُوهِ بِيضُ الثِّيَابِ فَقَالُوا:اخْرُجِي أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ إِلَى رُوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَانَ، فَتَخْرُجُ مِنْ فَمِهِ كَمَا تَسِيلُ الْقَطْرَةُ مِنْ فَمِ السِّقَاء»\n(When death approaches the believer, angels with white faces and white clothes come to him and say: \"O good soul! Come out to comfort and provision and a Lord who is not angry.\" The soul then comes out of his mouth like a drop of water pouring out of a water skin.) Their good news in the Hereafter is as Allah said:\nلاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ\n(The greatest terror (on the Day of Resurrection) will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised.\") (21:103), and,\nيَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ\n(On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women -- their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!)(57:12) Allah then said:\nلاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ\n(No change can there be in the Words of Allah.) meaning, this promise doesn't change or breach or fall short. It is decreed and firm, and going to happen undoubtedly.\nذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ\n(This is indeed the supreme success.)"

An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) In the Hadith narrated by Al-Bara', the Prophet said:\nإِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ إِذَا حَضَرَهُ الْمُوتُ جَاءَهُ مَلَائِكَةٌ بِيضُ الْوُجُوهِ بِيضُ الثِّيَابِ فَقَالُوا:اخْرُجِي أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ إِلَى رُوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَانَ، فَتَخْرُجُ مِنْ فَمِهِ كَمَا تَسِيلُ الْقَطْرَةُ مِنْ فَمِ السِّقَاء»\n(When death approaches the believer, angels with white faces and white clothes come to him and say: \"O good soul! Come out to comfort and provision and a Lord who is not angry.\" The soul then comes out of his mouth like a drop of water pouring out of a water skin.) Their good news in the Hereafter is as Allah said:\nلاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ\n(The greatest terror (on the Day of Resurrection) will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised.\") (21:103), and,\nيَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ\n(On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women -- their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!)(57:12) Allah then said:\nلاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ\n(No change can there be in the Words of Allah.) meaning, this promise doesn't change or breach or fall short. It is decreed and firm, and going to happen undoubtedly.\nذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ\n(This is indeed the supreme success.)"

      "text": "Identifying the Awliya' of Allah\nAllah tells us that His Awliya' (friends and allies) are those who believe and have Taqwa of Allah as He defined them. Every pious, God-fearing person is a friend of Allah, therefore,\nلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ\n(no fear shall come upon them) from the future horrors they will face in the Hereafter.\nوَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(nor shall they grieve.) over anything left behind in this world. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِ اللهِ عِبَادًا يَغْبِطُهُمُ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَالشُّهَدَاء»\n(Among the servants of Allah there will be those whom the Prophets and the martyrs will consider fortunate). It was said: \"Who are these, O Messenger of Allah, so we may love them\" He said:\n«هُمْ قَوْمٌ تَحَابُّوا فِي اللهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَمْوَالٍ وَلَا أَنْسَابٍ، وُجُوهُهُمْ نُورٌ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ، لَا يَخَافُون إِذَا خَافَ النَّاسُ، وَلَا يَحْزَنُونَ إِذَا حَزِنَ النَّاس»\n(These are people who loved one another for the sake of Allah without any other interest like money or kinship. Their faces will be light, upon platforms of light. They shall have no fear (on that Day) when fear shall come upon people. Nor shall they grieve when others grieve.) Then he recited:\nأَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ اللَّهِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(Behold!! Verily, the Awliya' (friends and allies) of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.)\nThe True Dream is a Form of Good News\nIbn Jarir narrated from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he recited to Allah's Messenger ﷺ:\nلَهُمُ الْبُشْرَى فِي الْحَيوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(For them is good news, in the life of the present world, and in the Hereafter.) and said, \"We know the good news of the Hereafter, it is Paradise. But what is the good news in this world\" He said:\n«الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يَرَاهَا الْعَبْدُ أَوْ تُرَى لَهُ. وَهِيَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ أَرْبَعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا أَوْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة»\n(It is the good dream that a servant may see or it is seen about him. This dream is one part from forty-four or seventy parts of Prophethood.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What about a man who does deeds that the people commend him for\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«تِلْكَ عَاجِلُ بُشْرَى الْمُؤْمِن»\n(That is the good news that has been expedited for the believer.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\nلَهُمُ الْبُشْرَى فِي الْحَيوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ\n(For them is good news, in the life of the present world) Then he said,\n«الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ يُبَشَّرُهَا الْمُؤْمِنُ، جُزْءٌ مِنْ تِسْعَةٍ وَأَرْبَعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّةِ، فَمَنْ رَأَى ذَلِكَ فَلْيُخْبِرْ بِهَا،وَمَنْ رَأَى سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ لِيُحْزِنَهُ، فَلْيَنْفُثْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلَاثًا، وَلْيُكَبِّرْ، وَلَا يُخْبِرْ بِهَا أَحَدًا»\n(The good dream that comes as a good news for the believer is a part of forty-nine parts of prophethood. So if anyone of you has a good dream, he should narrate it to others. But if he has a dream that he dislikes, then it is from Shaytan to make him sad. He should blow to his left three times, and say : \"Allahu Akbar,\" and should not mention it to anyone.\") And it was also said, \"The good news here is the glad tidings the angels bring to the believer at the time of death. They bring him the good news of Paradise and forgiveness.\" Similarly, Allah said:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ\n(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah (alone),\" and then they stand straight and firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask.

Their good news in the Hereafter is as Allah said:\nلاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ\n(The greatest terror (on the Day of Resurrection) will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised.\") (21:103), and,\nيَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ\n(On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women -- their light running forward before them and by their right hands.

Tell them how Allah destroyed them and caused every last one of them all to drown. Let this be a lesson for your people, lest they will be destroyed like them.\nإِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ يَقَوْمِ إِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّقَامِى وَتَذْكِيرِى بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَعَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ\n(When he said to his people: \"O my people, if my stay (with you), and my reminding (you) of the Ayat of Allah is hard on you, then I put my trust in Allah.\") Meaning, `if you find that it is too much of an offense that I should live among you and preach to you the revelation of Allah and His signs and proofs, then I do not care what you think, and I will not stop inviting you.'\nفَأَجْمِعُواْ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَكُمْ\n(So devise your plot, you and your partners), `get together with all of your deities (idols and statues) that you call upon beside Allah,'\nثُمَّ لاَ يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً\n(and let not your plot be in confusion for you) meaning, an`d do not be confused about this, rather come and let us settle this together if you claim that you are truthful,'\nوَلاَ تُنظِرُونَ\n(and give me no respite.) `Do not give me respite even for one hour. Whatever you can do, go ahead and do it. I do not care, and I do not fear you, because you are not standing on anything.' This is similar to what Hud said to his people,\nإِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّى أُشْهِدُ اللَّهِ وَاشْهَدُواْ أَنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ - مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لاَ تُنظِرُونِ إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ\n(I call Allah to witness, and you bear witness, that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship with Him (Allah). So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord!) (11:54-55)\nIslam is the Religion of all of the Prophets\nNuh said,\nفَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ\n(But if you turn away) if you belie the message and turn away from obedience.\nفَمَا سَأَلْتُكُمْ مِّنْ أَجْرٍ\n(then no reward have I asked of you,) I have not asked you anything for my advice.\nإِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(My reward is only from Allah. And I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.) I submit to Islam. Islam is the religion of all of the Prophets from the first to the last. Their laws and their rules may be of different types but the religion is the same. Allah said:\nلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَـجاً\n(To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.)(5:48) Ibn `Abbas said: \"A way and a Sunnah.\" Here Nuh is saying:\nوَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.) Allah said about His friend, Ibrahim:\nإِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - وَوَصَّى بِهَآ إِبْرَهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَـبَنِىَّ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَى لَكُمُ الدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إَلاَّ وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ\n(When his Lord said to him, \"Submit (be a Muslim)!\" He said, \"I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.\" And this was enjoined by Ibrahim upon his sons and by Ya`qub (saying), \"O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except as Muslims.\")(2:131-132) Yusuf said:\nرَبِّ قَدْ آتَيْتَنِى مِنَ الْمُلْكِ وَعَلَّمْتَنِى مِن تَأْوِيلِ الاٌّحَادِيثِ فَاطِرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَنتَ وَلِىِّ فِى الدُّنُيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِى مُسْلِمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِى بِالصَّـلِحِينَ\n(My Lord! You have indeed bestowed on me of the sovereignty, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams -- the (Only) Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim, and join me with the righteous.)(12:101) Musa said:\nيقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءامَنْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُواْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ\n(O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.)(10:84) The magicians said:\nرَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَتَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ\n(Our Lord! pour out on us patience, and cause us to die as Muslims.)(7:126) Bilqis said:\nرَبِّ إِنِّى ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِى وَأَسْلَمْتُ مَعَ سُلَيْمَـنَ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit (I have become Muslim) together with Sulayman to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.) (27:44) Allah said:\nإِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ\n(Verily, We did send down the Tawrah, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, judged for the Jews.)(5:44) He also said:\nوَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى الْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ ءَامِنُواْ بِى وَبِرَسُولِى قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ\n(And when I (Allah) inspired Al-Hawariyyin to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: \"We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.\") (5:111) The last of the Messengers and the leader of mankind said:\nقُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.) (6:162-163) meaning, from this Ummah. He said, in an authentic Hadith:\n«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنِبْيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ. وَدِينُنُا وَاحِد»\n(We, the Prophets are brothers with (the same father but) different mothers. Our religion is the same,) meaning, `we should worship Allah alone without partners while having different laws.'\nThe Evil Goal and End of Criminals\nAllah said:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ\n(They denied him, but We delivered him, and those with him) meaning on his religion,\nفِى الْفُلْكِ\n(in the (Fulk) ship) Fulk refers to the ark, and,\nوَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ خَلاَئِفَ\n(We made them generations replacing one after another) on earth,\nوَأَغْرَقْنَا الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَـتِنَا فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُنْذَرِينَ\n(while We drowned those who belied Our Ayat.

      "text": "Meaning; Then after Nuh We sent Messengers to their people.\nThey brought them clear proofs. and evidences of the truth that they came with.\nفَمَا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ بِمَا كَذَّبُواْ بِهِ مِن قَبْلُ\n(But they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand) meaning the nations did not believe what their Messengers brought to them because they already rejected it from the beginning. Allah said:\nوَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ\n(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance).) (6:110) He then said here,\nكَذَلِكَ نَطْبَعُ عَلَى قُلوبِ الْمُعْتَدِينَ\n(Thus We seal the hearts of the transgressors.) This means that as Allah has set seals on the hearts of those people, such that they would not believe since they previously rejected faith, He would also set seals on the hearts of the people that are like them, who will come after them. They would not believe until they see the severe torment. This means that Allah destroyed the nations after Nuh. He destroyed the nations that rejected the Messengers and saved those who believed from among them. From the time of Adam to Nuh, people followed Islam. Then they invented the worship of idols. So Allah sent Nuh to them. That is why the believers will say to him on the Day of Resurrection, \"You are the first Messenger Allah sent to the people of the earth.\" Ibn `Abbas said: \"There were ten generations between Adam and Nuh, and all of them were following Islam.\" Allah also said:\nوَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ\n(And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh!) (17:17) This was a serious warning to the Arab pagans, who rejected the leader and last of the Messengers and Prophets. If the people before them who rejected their Messengers had received this much punishment, then what did they think will happen to them since they perpetrated even greater sins than others before them"

      "text": "Only a Few Youth from Fir`awn's People believed in Musa\nAllah tells us that despite all the clear signs and irrefutable evidence Musa came with, only a few offspring from Fir`awn's followers believed in him. They were even scared that Fir`awn and his followers would force them to return to Kufr (disbelief). Fir`awn was an evil tyrant and extremely arrogant. His people feared him and his power too much. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said:\nفَمَآ ءامَنَ لِمُوسَى إِلاَّ ذُرِّيَّةٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِ عَلَى خَوْفٍ مِّن فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِمْ أَن يَفْتِنَهُمْ\n(But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people because of the fear of Fir `awn and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them.) \"The offspring that believed in Musa from Fir`awn's people, other than Banu Israel, were few. Among them were Fir`awn's wife, the believer who was hiding his faith, Fir`awn's treasurer, and his wife.\" The Children of Israel, however, themselves believed in Musa, all of them. They were glad to see him coming. They knew of his description and the news of his advent from their previous Books. They knew that Allah was going to save them through him from the capture of Fir`awn and give them power over him. So when this knowledge reached Fir`awn he was very wary. But his caution and weariness didn't help him one bit. When Musa arrived, Fir`awn subjected them to great harm, and\nقَالُواْ أُوذِينَا مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَأْتِيَنَا وَمِن بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا قَالَ عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(They said: \"We (Children of Israel) suffered troubles before you came to us, and since you have come to us.\" He said: \"It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act')7:129 The fact that all of the Children Israel became believers is evidenced by the following Ayat:\nوَقَالَ مُوسَى يقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءامَنْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُواْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ"

      "text": "The Good Reward is for the People of Faith and Good Deeds\nIn these two Ayat, Allah promises the happy blessings for those who believed in Allah and His Messengers. And for those that have complied with what they were commanded to follow. The promise is that He will guide them because of their faith, or it may mean through their faith. As to the first interpretation, the meaning is that Allah will guide them on the Day of Resurrection to the straight path until they pass into Paradise because of their faith in this world. The other meaning is that their faith will assist them on the Day of Resurrection as Mujahid said:\nيَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ\n(Their Lord will guide them through their faith) meaning \"Their faith will be a light in which they will walk.\"\nدَعْوَهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَـنَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(Their way of request therein will be: \"Glory to You, O Allah!\" And Salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein! And the close of their request will be: \"All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\") meaning this is the condition of the people of Paradise. This is similar to what is found in the following Ayat:\nتَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُ سَلَـمٌ\n(Their greeting on the Day they shall meet Him will be \"Salam Peace!\") 33:44,\nلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً\n(No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!!\") 56:25-26,\nسَلاَمٌ قَوْلاً مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ\n((It will be said to them): \"Salam\" -- a Word from the Lord, Most Merciful.) 36:58,\nوَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍسَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ\n(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)!\") 13:23-24 In Allah's statement,\nوَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And the close of their request will be: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\") There is an indication that Allah Almighty is the Praised One always, the Worshipped at all times. This is why He praised Himself at the beginning and the duration of His creation. He also praised Himself in the beginning of His Book and the beginning of its revelation. Allah said:\nالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ\n(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant the Book (the Qur'an).) 18:1,\nالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ\n(All praise is due to Allah, Who (alone) created the heavens and the earth,) 6:1, and many other citations with this meaning. The Ayah also indicates that Allah is the Praised One in this world and in the Hereafter and in all situations. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim:\n«إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ يُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّحْمِيدَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»\n(The people of Paradise will be inspired to glorify Allah and praise Him as they instinctively breath.) This will be their nature because of the increasing bounties of Allah upon them. These bounties are repeated and brought back again and increased with no limit or termination. So praise be to Allah for there is no God but He and no Lord save He."

      "text": "The Children of Israel were saved and Fir`awn's People drowned\nAllah tells us how He caused Fir`awn and his soldiers to drown. The Children of Israel left Egypt in the company of Musa. It was said that there were six hundred thousand soldiers, plus offspring. They borrowed a lot of ornaments from the Coptics and took that with them. Fir`awn became very angry with them. So he sent heralds to all the cities to send their soldiers. He embarked, following behind them, filled with great pride and with massive armies. Allah wanted this to happen for He had a plan for them. No one that had any authority or power remained behind in Fir`awn's kingdom. They were all together and caught the Children of Israel at sunrise.\nفَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ\n(And when the two hosts met each other, the companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\") (26:61) They said that because when they got to the seashore Fir`awn was behind them. The two groups met face to face. The people with Musa kept asking, \"How can we be saved today\" Musa replied, \"I have been commanded to come this way.\" Musa said:\nكَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ\n(Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.) (26:62) It had been so difficult, but it suddenly became easy. Allah commanded him to strike the ocean with his staff. He did and the sea was cleft asunder, each part stood like a mighty mountain. The sea was split into twelve paths, each route for each Israelite tribe. Allah then commanded the wind and the path was dry for them.\nفَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً وَلاَ تَخْشَى\n(And strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken by Fir`awn nor being afraid (of drowning in the sea).)(20:77) The water in between the paths appeared as windows and every tribe was able to see the other so they would not think that others were destroyed. The Children of Israel crossed the sea. When the last one crossed, Fir`awn and his soldiers had arrived at the edge of the other shore. They were one hundred thousand black horses in addition to horsemen of other colors. When Fir`awn saw the sea he was frightened. He wanted to turn back, but it was too late. Allah's decree prevailed and the prayer of Musa was answered. Jibril came on a war stallion. He passed by Fir`awn's horse. Jibril's horse whinnied at Fir`awn's and then Jibril rushed into the sea, and Fir`awn did the same behind him. Fir`awn no longer had any control over matters. He wanted to sound strong before his chiefs, so he said: \"The Children of Israel do not have more right in the sea.\" So they rushed into the sea. Mika'il was behind their army pushing them all to join. When they all were in the sea and the first of them was about to emerge on the other side, Allah, the All-Powerful, commanded the sea to strand them. The sea closed over them and none was saved. The waves took them up and down. The waves accumulated above Fir`awn and he was overwhelmed by the stupors of death. While in this state, he said:\nءَامَنتُ أَنَّهُ لا إِلِـهَ إِلاَّ الَّذِى ءَامَنَتْ بِهِ بَنواْ إِسْرَءِيلَ وَأَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He (Allah) in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of the Muslims.) He believed at a time when he couldn't benefit from his faith.\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَـفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ - فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَـنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ الْكَـفِرُونَ\n(So when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah Alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as (His) partners.\" Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants. And there the disbelievers lost utterly (when Our torment covered them).)(40:84-85) Therefore Allah said, as a response to Fir`awn,\nءَالَنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ\n(Now (you believe) while you refused to believe before) do you say that just now when you have disobeyed Allah before that.\nوَكُنتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(And you were one of the mischief-makers.) You were among the makers of mischief on the earth who misled the people.\nوَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ\n(and We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.) (28:41) These facts about Fir`awn and his status at that time were among the secrets of the Unseen that Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad ﷺ. Similarly Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said;\n«قَالَ لِي جِبْرِيلُ: لَوْ رَأَيْتَنِي وَأَنَا آخِذٌ مِنْ حَالِ الْبَحْرِ فَأَدُسُّهُ فِي فَمِ فِرْعَونَ مَخَافَةَ أَنْ تُدْرِكَهُ الرَّحْمَة»\n(Jibril said to me, \"If you could have seen me while I was taking black mud from the sea and placing into the mouth of Fir`awn out of fear that the mercy would reach him.\") Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib Sahih.\" About Allah's statement,\nفَالْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ ءَايَةً\n(So this day We shall deliver your (dead) body (out from the sea) that you may be a sign to those who come after you!) Ibn `Abbas and others from among the Salaf have said: \"Some of the Children of Israel doubted the death of Fir`awn so Allah commanded the sea to throw his body -- whole, without a soul -- with his known armor plate. The body was thrown to a high place on the land so that the Children of Israel could confirm his death and destruction.\" That is why Allah said,\nفَالْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ\n(\"So this day We shall deliver your..\") meaning that We will put your body on a high place on the earth. Mujahid said,\nبِبَدَنِكَ\n(your (dead) body) means, `your physical body. \"\nلِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ ءَايَةً\n(that you may be a sign to those who come after you!) meaning, so that might be a proof of your death and destruction for the Children of Israel. That also stood as a proof that Allah is All-Powerful, in Whose control are all the creatures. Nothing can bear His anger. Fir`awn and his people were destroyed on the day of `Ashura', as recorded by Al-Bukhari, Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the Prophet arrived at Al-Madinah, the Jews fasted the day of `Ashura'. So he asked,\n«مَا هَذَا الْيَومُ الَّذِي تَصُومُونَهُ؟»\n(What is this day that you are fasting) They responded `This is the day in which Musa was victorious over Fir`awn.' So the Prophet said,\n«أَنْتُمْ أَحَقُّ بِمُوسَى مِنْهُمْ فَصُومُوه»\n(You have more right to Musa than they, so fast it.)"

      "text": "The Children of Israel were saved and Fir`awn's People drowned\nAllah tells us how He caused Fir`awn and his soldiers to drown. The Children of Israel left Egypt in the company of Musa. It was said that there were six hundred thousand soldiers, plus offspring. They borrowed a lot of ornaments from the Coptics and took that with them. Fir`awn became very angry with them. So he sent heralds to all the cities to send their soldiers. He embarked, following behind them, filled with great pride and with massive armies. Allah wanted this to happen for He had a plan for them. No one that had any authority or power remained behind in Fir`awn's kingdom. They were all together and caught the Children of Israel at sunrise.\nفَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ\n(And when the two hosts met each other, the companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\") (26:61) They said that because when they got to the seashore Fir`awn was behind them. The two groups met face to face. The people with Musa kept asking, \"How can we be saved today\" Musa replied, \"I have been commanded to come this way.\" Musa said:\nكَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ\n(Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.) (26:62) It had been so difficult, but it suddenly became easy. Allah commanded him to strike the ocean with his staff. He did and the sea was cleft asunder, each part stood like a mighty mountain. The sea was split into twelve paths, each route for each Israelite tribe. Allah then commanded the wind and the path was dry for them.\nفَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً وَلاَ تَخْشَى\n(And strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken by Fir`awn nor being afraid (of drowning in the sea).)(20:77) The water in between the paths appeared as windows and every tribe was able to see the other so they would not think that others were destroyed. The Children of Israel crossed the sea. When the last one crossed, Fir`awn and his soldiers had arrived at the edge of the other shore. They were one hundred thousand black horses in addition to horsemen of other colors. When Fir`awn saw the sea he was frightened. He wanted to turn back, but it was too late.

      "text": "The Establishment of the Children of Israel in the Land and Their Provision from the Good Things\nIn these Ayat, Allah tells us about all the worldly and religious gifts which He bestowed upon the Children of Israel. Allah's statement,\nمُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ\n(honorable dwelling place) means in Egypt and Syria, around Jerusalem, as it was said by some. When Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his soldiers, the Mosaic State took control of all of Egypt as Allah said:\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)(7:137) He said in other Ayat:\nفَأَخْرَجْنَـهُمْ مِّن جَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ - كَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَـهَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So, We expelled them from gardens and springs. Treasures, and every kind of honorable place. Thus, and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.)(26:57 -59) He also said:\nكَمْ تَرَكُواْ مِن جَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ\n(How many of gardens and springs that they left behind. ..) (44:25-27) They then continued with Musa, to seek Jerusalem -- the land of Ibrahim, the friend of Allah. There were giant people in Jerusalem. The Children of Israel refrained from fighting them. So Allah expelled them into the wilderness for forty years. During this time in the wilderness, first Harun died and then Musa. Yusha` bin Nun led after them. Allah supported them to conquer Jerusalem and rule it for a period of time. His statement,\nوَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ\n(and provided them with good things) means from the lawful, pure and useful provision that is good in nature and in Law. Then Allah said:\nفَمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ\n(and they differed not until the knowledge came to them.) There should be no reason for them to have any disputes among them since Allah has sent them knowledge and explained different matters and issues to them. It has been mentioned in a Hadith,\n«إِنَّ الْيَهُودَ اخْتَلَفُوا عَلَى إِحْدَى وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَإِنَّ النَّصَارَى اخْتَلَفُوا عَلَى اثْنَتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَاثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، مِنْهَا وَاحِدَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَاثْنَتَانِ وَسَبْعُونَ فِي النَّار»\n(The Jews separated into seventy-one sects, and the Christians separated into seventy-two sects, and this Ummah will separate into seventy-three sects, one of which is in Paradise, seventy-two in the Fire.) They asked, \"Who are they O Messenger of Allah!\" He replied;\n«مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي»\n(Those upon what I and my Companions are upon. ) It was recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak with this wording. So here Allah said,\nإِن رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُم\n(Verily your Lord will judge between them) Here the meaning is, to distinguish between them\nيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ\n(the Day of Resurrection in that which they used to differ.)"

      "text": "Previous books Attest to the Truth of the Qur'an\nAllah said:\nالَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِىَّ الأُمِّىَّ الَّذِى يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِى التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ\n(Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written of with them in the Tawrah and the Injil.)(7:157) They are as certain of this as they are about who their children are, yet they hide it and distort it. They did not believe in it despite its clear evidence. Therefore Allah said:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ\n(Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) meaning they would not believe in a way that they might benefit from that belief.

An example is when Musa prayed against Fir`awn and his chiefs, saying:\nرَبَّنَا اطْمِسْ عَلَى أَمْوَلِهِمْ وَاشْدُدْ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُواْ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ\n(Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment.)(10:88) And Allah said:\nوَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ قُبُلاً مَّا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ\n(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would not have believed, unless Allah willed, but most of them behave ignorantly.)

      "text": "Belief at the Time of Punishment did not help except with the People of Yunus\nAllah asked, `did any town from the previous nations, believe in its entirety when they received the Messengers All of the Messengers that We sent before you, O Muhammad, were denied by their people or the majority of their people.' Allah said,\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.)(36:30)\nكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ\n(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\")(51:52) and\nوَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ\n(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\")(43:23) As found in the authentic Hadith,\n«عُرِضَ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ فَجَعَلَ النَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ وَمَعَهُ الْفِئَامُ مِنَ النَّاسِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الرَّجُلُ، وَالنَّبِيُّ مَعَهُ الرَّجُلَانِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ لَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»\n(The Prophets were displayed before me. There was a Prophet who passed with a group of people, and a Prophet who passed with only one man, a Prophet with two men, and a Prophet with no one.) Then he mentioned the mulititude of followers that Musa had, peace be upon him, then that he saw his nation of people filling from the west to the east. The point is that between Musa and Yunus, there was no nation, in its entirety, that believed except the people of Yunus, the people of Naynawa (Nineveh). And they only believed because they feared that the torment from which their Messenger warned them, might strike them. They actually witnessed its signs. So they cried to Allah and asked for help. They engaged in humility in invoking Him. They brought their children and cattle and asked Allah to lift the torment from which their Prophet had warned them. As a result, Allah sent His mercy and removed the scourge from them and gave them respite. Allah said:\nإِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ\n(Except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.) In interpreting this Ayah, Qatadah said: \"No town has denied the truth and then believed when they saw the scourge, and then their belief benefited them, with the exception of the people of Yunus. When they lost their Prophet and they thought that the scourge was close upon them, Allah sent through their hearts the desire to repent. So they wore woolen fabrics and they separated each animal from its offspring. They then cried out to Allah for forty nights. When Allah saw the truth in their hearts and that they were sincere in their repentance and regrets, He removed the scourge from them.\" Qatadah said: \"It was mentioned that the people of Yunus were in Naynawa, the land of Mosul.\" This was also reported from Ibn Mas`ud, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and others from the Salaf."

But Allah has wisdom in what He does.' Similarly, Allah said:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ\nإِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاّمْلاّنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one Ummah, but they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy and for that did He create them. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (His saying): \"Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.\") (11:118-119) He also said,\nأَفَلَمْ يَاْيْـَسِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا\n(Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind) (13:31) Therefore, Allah said:\nأَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ\n(So, will you then compel mankind) and force them to believe.\nحَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(until they become believers.) meaning, it is not for you to do that. You are not commanded to do that either. It is Allah Who\nيُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.)(35:8).\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So do not destroy yourself in sorrow for them.)\nلَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(It is not up to you to guide them, but Allah guides whom He wills.)2:272.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(It may be that you would kill yourself with grief because they are not believers.) 26:3\nإِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ\n(you guide not who you like..) 28:56\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(Your duty is only to convey, and it is up to Us to reckon. ) 13:40\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind, you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.) 88:21-22 There are other Ayat besides these which prove that Allah is the doer of what He wants, guiding whom He wills, leading whom He wills to stray, all out of His knowledge, wisdom, and justice. Similarly, He said,\nوَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَن تُؤْمِنَ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَيَجْعَلُ الرِّجْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(It is not for any person to believe, except by the leave of Allah, and He will put the Rijs) That is, disorder and misguidance\nعَلَى الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ\n(upon those who do not reason) meaning, Allah's proofs and evidences, and He is the Just in all matters, guiding whom He wills to guide, and leading whom He wills astray."
