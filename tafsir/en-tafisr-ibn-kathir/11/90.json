  "text": "وَيقَوْمِ لاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِى\n(And O my people! Let not my Shiqaq cause you) This means, \"Do not let your hatred and enmity of me cause you to persist in your corruption and disbelief. If you continue this way, you will suffer the same vengeance and torment that overcame Nuh's people, Hud's people, Salih's people and Lut's people.\" Qatadah said,\nوَيقَوْمِ لاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِى\n(And O my people! Let not my Shiqaq cause you) \"He is saying, `Do not be influenced by your differing with me.\"' As-Suddi said, \"This means your enmity of me should not lead you to continue in misguidance and disbelief, or else you will be afflicted by what afflicted them.\" Concerning His statement,\nوَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ\n(and the people of Lut are not far off from you!) It has been said that this refers to the period of time. Qatadah said, \"This means that they were only destroyed before you yesterday.\" It has also been said that it refers to place. Actually, the verse carries both meanings.\nوَاسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ\n(And ask forgiveness of your Lord) from the previous sins.\nثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ\n(and turn unto Him in repentance.) In whatever evil actions you may encounter in the future. Concerning his statement,\nإِنَّ رَبِّى رَحِيمٌ وَدُودٌ\n(Verily, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving.) to those who repent.",
