  "text": "Shu`ayb's Refutation of His People\nHe said to them: Do you see O my people, that if I\nعَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى\n(have a clear evidence from my Lord) meaning, upon clear guidance in that which I am calling to.\nوَرَزَقَنِى مِنْهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا\n(and He has given me a good sustenance from Himself.) It has been said that he meant the prophethood. It has also been said that he meant the lawful provisions. It seems that the verse carries both meanings. Ath-Thawri said,\nوَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ\n(I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) meaning, `do not forbid you from something and at the same time I contradict my prohibitions in secret behind your backs, doing what I have forbidden.' This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,\nوَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ\n(I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) \"He is saying, `I do not forbid you all from something while I do it myself.\"'\nإِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ الإِصْلَـحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ\n(I only desire reform to the best of my power.) This means, \"In that which I command and forbid you, I only want to correct your affair as much as I am able.\"\nوَمَا تَوْفِيقِى\n(And my guidance cannot come) This means, \"In whatever I intend that agrees with the truth.\"\nإِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ\n(except from Allah, in Him I put my trust) This means in all of my affairs.\nوَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ\n(and unto Him I repent.) meaning; \"I return.\" This has been said by Mujahid and others.",
