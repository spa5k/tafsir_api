  "text": "The Command to Stand Firm and Straight\nAllah, the Exalted, commands His Messenger and His believing servants to be firm and to always be upright. This is of the greatest aid for gaining victory over the enemy and confronting the opposition. Allah also forbids transgression, which is to exceed the bounds (of what is allowed). Verily, transgression causes destruction to its practitioner, even if the transgression was directed against a polytheist. Then, Allah informs that He is All-Seer of the actions of His servants. He is not unaware of anything and nothing is hidden from Him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلاَ تَرْكَنُواْ إِلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ\n(And incline not toward those who do wrong,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Do not compromise with them.\" Ibn Jarir said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Do not side with those who do wrong.\" This is a good statement. This means, \"Do not seek assistance from wrongdoers, because it will be as if you are condoning their actions (of evil).\"\nفَتَمَسَّكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ثُمَّ لاَ تُنصَرُونَ\n(lest the Fire should touch you, and you have no protectors other than Allah, nor you would then be helped.) This means that you will not have besides Allah any friend who can save you, nor any helper who can remove you from His torment.",
