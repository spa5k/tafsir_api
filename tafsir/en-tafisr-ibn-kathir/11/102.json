In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Musa said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»\n(Verily, Allah gives respite to a wrongdoer until He seizes him and he cannot escape.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited,\nوَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ\n(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. )",
