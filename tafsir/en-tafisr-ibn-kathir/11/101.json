This means totally destroyed.\nوَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ\n(We wronged them not,) This means, \"When We destroyed them.\"\nوَلَـكِن ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ\n(but they wronged themselves.) their rejecting their Messengers and disbelieving in them.\nفَمَا أَغْنَتْ عَنْهُمْ ءَالِهَتَهُمُ\n(So their gods, profited them not...) This is referring to their idols that they used to worship and invoke.\nمِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ\n(other than Allah naught) the idols did not benefit them, nor did they save them when Allah's com- mand came for their destruction.\nوَمَا زَادُوهُمْ غَيْرَ تَتْبِيبٍ\n(nor did they add aught to them but destruction.) Mujahid, Qatadah and others said, \"This means loss. Because the reason for their destruction and their ruin was that they followed those false gods. Therefore, they were losers in this life and the Hereafter.\"",
