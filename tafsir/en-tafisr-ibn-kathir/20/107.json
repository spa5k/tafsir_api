  "text": "The destruction of the Mountains, and the Earth becomes a Smooth Plain\nAllah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains.) This is a question, will they remain on the Day of Resurrection or will they cease to exist\nفَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(Say: \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") This means that He will take them away from their places, wipe them out and remove them completely.\nفَيَذَرُهَا\n(Then He shall leave it) referring to the earth;\nقَاعاً صَفْصَفاً\n(as a level smooth plain.) This means one expanse spread out. The word Qa` means a piece of land that is level and the word Safsafa is used to place emphasis on this meaning. It has also been said that Safsafa means that which has no vegetation growing in it. The first meaning is preferred, even though the second meaning is also included by necessity. In reference to this, Allah says,\nلاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً\n(You will see therein no crookedness nor curve. ) meaning, `on that Day you will not see in the earth any valley, hill, or any place, whether low or elevated.' Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others of the Salaf all said the same.\nThe People will rush towards the Voice of the Caller\nيَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ الدَّاعِىَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ\n(On that Day mankind will follow strictly Allah's caller, no crookedness will they show him.) On the Day, they see these conditions and these frightening sights, they will hastily respond to the caller. Wherever they are commanded to go, they will rush to it. If they had been like this in the worldly life, it would have been more beneficial for them, but here it does not benefit them. This is as Allah says,\nأَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا\n(How clearly will they see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) 19:38 Allah also says,\nمُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ\n(hastening towards the caller.) Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَخَشَعَتِ الأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ\n(And all voices will be humbled for the Most Gracious,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means they will be silent.\" As-Suddi also said the same.\nفَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً\n(And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) Sa`id bin Jubayr related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means the steps of feet.\" `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd and others all said the same. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said,\nفَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً\n(And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) \"Hamsa means a hidden voice.\" This has also been repor- ted from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,\nفَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً\n(And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) \"Hamsa means the secret speech and the steps of feet.\"",
