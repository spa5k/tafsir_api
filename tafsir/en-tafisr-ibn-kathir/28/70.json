  "text": "Allah Alone is the One Who has the Power of Creation, Knowledge and Choice\nAllah tells us that He is the only One Who has the power to create and make decisions, and there is no one who can dispute with Him in that or reverse His judgement. His saying:\nوَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيَخْتَارُ\n(And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses,) means, whatever He wills, for what He wills, happens; and what He does not will, does not happen. All things, good and bad alike, are in His Hands and will return to Him.\nمَا كَانَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ\n(no choice have they.) is a negation, according to the correct view. This is like the Ayah,\nوَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلاَ مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْراً أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ\n(It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision) (33:36). Then Allah says:\nوَرَبُّكَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ\n(And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal, and what they reveal.) He knows what is hidden in their hearts, just as He knows what they do openly.\nسَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ\n(It is the same whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.) (13:10).\nوَهُوَ اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(And He is Allah; La ilaha illa Huwa,) meaning, He is unique in His divinity, for none is to be worshipped besides Him, and there is no lord who can create what he wills and chooses besides Him.\nلَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٍّولَى وَالاٌّخِرَةِ\n(His is the praise, in the first and in the last,) in all that He does, He is to be praised for His justice and wisdom.\nوَلَهُ الْحُكْمُ\n(His is the decision,) that none can put back, because of His might, power, wisdom and mercy.\nوَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(and to Him shall you be returned.) means, all of you on the Day of Resurrection, and everyone will be rewarded or punished according to his deeds, good and evil alike, and absolutely none of their deeds will be concealed from Him.",
