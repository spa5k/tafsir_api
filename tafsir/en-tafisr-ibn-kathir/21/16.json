  "text": "Creation was made with Justice and Wisdom\nAllah tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in truth, i.e. with justice.\nلِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيِجْزِى الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِالْحُسْنَى\n(that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best.) 53:31. He did not create all that in vain or for (mere) play:\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38:27\nلَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ\n(Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that).) Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid:\nلَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ\n(Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us,) \"Meaning, `From Ourself,' He is saying, `We would not have created Paradise or Hell or death or the resurrection or the Reckoning.\"'\nإِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ\n(if We were going to do (that). ) Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mughirah bin Miqsam said: \"This means, `We will not do that.\"' Mujahid said, every time the word\nأَنْ\n(if) is used in the Qur'an, it is a negation.\nبَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ\n(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood,) means, `We explain the truth and thus defeat falsehood.' Allah says:\nفَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ\n(so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears.) it is fading and vanishing.\nوَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ\n(And woe to you) O you who say that Allah has offspring.\nمِمَّا تَصِفُونَ\n(for that which you ascribe.) that which you say and fabricate. Then Allah informs of the servitude of the angels, and how they persevere in worship night and day:\nEverything belongs to Allah and serves Him\nوَلَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ\n(To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. And those who are near Him) i.e., the angels,\nلاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ\n(are not too proud to worship Him,) they do not feel proud and do not refuse to worship Him. This is like the Ayah:\nلَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ الْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً\n(Al-Masih will never be proud to reject being a servant of Allah, nor the angels who are the near. And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.) 4:172\nوَلاَ يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ\n(nor are they weary.) means, they do not get tired or feel bored.\nيُسَبِّحُونَ الْلَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لاَ يَفْتُرُونَ\n(They glorify His praises night and day, they never slacken.) They persist in their worship night and day, obeying Allah to the utmost, and they are able to do this, as Allah says:\nلاَّ يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ\n(who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, but do what they are commanded) 66:6",
