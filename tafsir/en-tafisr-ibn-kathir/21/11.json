  "text": "The Virtue of the Qur'an Here\nAllah points out the noble status of the Qur'an and urges them to recognize its worth:\nلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ\n(Indeed, We have sent down for you a Book in which there is Dhikrukum). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Honor for you.\"\nأَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ\n(Will you not then understand) means, will you not understand this blessing, and accept it This is like the Ayah:\nوَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ\n(And verily, this is indeed a Reminder for you and your people, and you will be questioned.) 43:44\nHow the Evildoers were destroyed\nوَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَـلِمَةً\n(How many a town given to wrongdoing, have We destroyed,) meaning, they were very many. This is like the Ayah:\nوَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ\n(And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh!) 17:17\nفَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا\n(And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing, so that it lie in ruins) 22:45.\nوَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْماً ءَاخَرِينَ\n(and raised up after them another people!) means, another nation which came after them.\nفَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأْسَنَآ\n(Then, when they sensed Our torment,) when they realized that the torment would undoubtedly come upon them, just as their Prophet had warned them,\nإِذَا هُمْ مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ\n(behold, they (tried to) flee from it.) they tried to run away.\nلاَ تَرْكُضُواْ وَارْجِعُواْ إِلَى مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَـكِنِكُمْ\n(Flee not, but return to that wherein you lived a luxurious life, and to your homes,) This is a way of ridiculing them. It will be said to them by way of ridicule: \"Do not run away from the coming torment; go back to the delights and luxuries and fine homes in which you were living.\" Qatadah said, \"Mocking them.\"\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ\n(in order that you may be questioned) about whether you gave thanks for what you had.\nقَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ\n(They cried: \"Woe to us! Certainly we have been wrong- doers.\") They will confess their sins when it will be of no benefit to them.\nفَمَا زَالَت تِلْكَ دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّى جَعَلْنَـهُمْ حَصِيداً خَـمِدِينَ\n(And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is reaped, extinct.) meaning, \"they will keep on saying that, admitting their wrong- doing, until We harvest them as it were, and their movements and voices come to a stop.\"",
