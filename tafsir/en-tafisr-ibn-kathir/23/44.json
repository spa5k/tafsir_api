  "text": "Mention of Other Nations Allah says:\nثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً ءَاخَرِينَ\n(Then, after them, We created other generations.) meaning, nations and peoples.\nمَّا تَسْبِقُ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسْتَـْخِرُونَ\n(No nation can advance their term, nor can they delay it.) means, they are taken at the appropriate time, as decreed by Allah in His Book that is preserved with Him, before they were created, nation after nation, century after century, generation after generation, successors after predecessors.\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"(This means) following one another in succession.\" This is like the Ayah:\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid Taghut (all false deities).\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified) 16:36.\nكُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him;) meaning the greater majority of them. This is like the Ayah:\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) 36:30\nفَأَتْبَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ بَعْضاً\n(so We made them follow one another,) means, `We destroyed them,' as Allah says:\nوَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ\n(And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh!) 17:17\nوَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ\n(and We made them as Ahadith) meaning, stories and lessons for mankind, as Allah says elsewhere:\nفَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ وَمَزَّقْنَـهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ\n(so, We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all totally) 34:19.",
