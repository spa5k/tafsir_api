  "text": "The Story of Nuh, Peace be upon Him; and his people\nAllah tells us about Nuh, peace be upon him, whom He sent him to his people to warn them of the severe punishment of Allah and His severe vengeance on those who associated partners with Him, defied His commands and disbelieved His Messengers:\nفَقَالَ يَقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ\n(and he said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him. Will you not then have Taqwa\") Meaning, \"Do you not fear Allah when you associate others in worship with Him\" The chiefs or leaders of his people said:\nمَا هَـذَا إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(He is no more than a human being like you, he seeks to make himself superior to you.) meaning, `he is putting himself above you and trying to make himself great by claiming to be a Prophet, but he is a human being like you, so how can he receive revelation when you do not'\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لاّنزَلَ مَلَـئِكَةً\n(Had Allah willed, He surely could have sent down angels.) meaning, `if Allah had wanted to send a Prophet, He would have sent an angel from Him, not a human being. We have never heard of such a thing -- i.e., sending a man to our forefathers' -- their predecessors in times past.\nإِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ\n(He is only a man in whom is madness,) means, `he is crazy in his claim that Allah has sent him and chosen him from among you to receive revelation.'\nفَتَرَبَّصُواْ بِهِ حَتَّى حِينٍ\n(so wait for him a while.) means, `wait until he dies, put up with him until you are rid of him.'",
