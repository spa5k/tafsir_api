  "text": "The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev\nAllah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'\nإِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ\n(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.\nالاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)\nGood News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise\nيعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ\n(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ\n((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:\nيعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ\n(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ\n((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"\nادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ\n(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.\nأَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ\n(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts\nتُحْبَرُونَ\n(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.\nيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ\n(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:\nمَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ\n(that their souls desire,)\nوَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ\n(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.\nوَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا\n(and you will therein) means, in Paradise\nخَـلِدُونَ\n(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:\nوَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ\n(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.\nمِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ\n(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.",
