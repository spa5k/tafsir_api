Imam Malik recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Qays asked An-Nu`man bin Bashir, \"What else did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite on Friday along with Surat Al-Jumu`ah\" An-Nu`man replied, \"Al-Ghashiyah (88).\" This narration has been recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Muslim and Ibn Majah.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Day of Judgement and what will happen to the People of the Fire during it Al-Ghashiyah is one of\nThis was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. It has been called this because it will overwhelm the people and overcome them. Allah then says,\nوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ\n(Some faces that Day will be Khashi`ah.) meaning, humiliated. This was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said, \"They will be humble but this action will be of no benefit to them.\" Then Allah says,\nعَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ\n(Laboring, weary.) meaning, they did many deeds and became weary in their performance, yet they will be cast into a blazing Fire on the Day of Judgement. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Burqani narrated from Abu `Imran Al-Jawni that he said, \" `Umar bin Al-Khattab passed by the monastery of a monk and he said: `O monk!' Then the monk came out, and `Umar looked at him and began to weep. Then it was said to him: `O Commander of the faithful! Why are you weeping' He replied: `I remembered the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book,\nعَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً\n(Laboring, weary. They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah.) So that is what has made me cry. \"' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said,\nعَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ\n(Laboring, weary.) \"The Christians.\" It is narrated that `Ikrimah and As-Suddi both said, \"Laboring in the worldly life with disobedience, and weariness in the Fire from torment and perdition.\" Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said,\nتَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً\n(They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah) meaning, hot with intense heat.\nتُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ\n(They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring.) meaning, its heat has reached its maximum limit and boiling point. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Concerning Allah's statement,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"A tree from the Hellfire.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, \"It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant).\" Qatadah said, \"The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground.\" Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, \"Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous.\" Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) \"This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.\" Sa`id narrated from Qatadah that he said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but Dari`,) \"This is of the worst, most disgusting and loathsome of foods.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nلاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ\n(Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) This means that the intent in eating it will not be achieved, and nothing harmful will be repelled by it."

This will only occur due to their striving. Sufyan said,\nلِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ\n(Glad with their endeavor.) \"They will be pleased with their deeds.\" Then Allah says,\nفِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ\n(In a lofty Paradise.) meaning, elevated and brilliant, secure in their dwellings.\nلاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً\n(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) meaning, they will not hear in the Paradise that they will be in, any foolish word.

They have mentioned that whenever the friend of Allah wishes to sit on these lofty thrones, they (the thrones) will lower themselves for him.\nوَأَكْوَابٌ مَّوْضُوعَةٌ\n(And cups set at hand.) meaning, drinking containers that are prepared and presented for whoever among their masters (i.e., the people of Paradise) wants them.\nوَنَمَارِقُ مَصْفُوفَةٌ\n(And Namariq set in rows.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"An-Namariq are pillows.\" This was also said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and others. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَزَرَابِيُّ مَبْثُوثَةٌ\n(And Zarabi, spread out (Mabthuthah).) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Az-Zarabi are carpets.\" This was also said by Ad-Dahhak and others. Here the word Mabthuthah means placed here and there for whoever would like to sit upon them."

      "text": "The Exhortation to look at the Creation of the Camel, the Heaven, the Mountains and the Earth\nAllah commands His servants to look at His creations that prove His power and greatness. He says,\nأَفَلاَ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَى الإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ\n(Do they not look at the camels, how they are created) Indeed it is an amazing creation, and the way it has been fashioned is strange. For it is extremely powerful and strong, yet gentle, carrying heavy loads. It allows itself to be guided by a weak rider. It is eaten, benefit is derived from its hair, and its milk is drunk. They are reminded of this because the most common domestic animal of the Arabs was the camel. Shurayh Al-Qadi used to say, \"Come out with us so that we may look at the camels and how they were created, and at the sky and how it has been raised.\" Meaning, how Allah raised it in such magnificence above the ground. This is as Allah says,\nأَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُواْ إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَـهَا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ\n(Have they not looked at the heaven above them, how we have made it and adorned it and there are no rifts on it) (50:6) Then Allah says,\nوَإِلَى الْجِبَالِ كَيْفَ نُصِبَتْ\n(And at the mountains, how they are rooted) meaning, how they have been erected. For indeed they are firmly affixed so that the earth does not sway with its dwellers. And He made them with the benefits and minerals they contain.\nوَإِلَى الاٌّرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ\n(And at the earth, how it is outspread) meaning, how it has been spread out, extended and made smooth. Thus, He directs the bedouin to consider what he himself witnesses. His camel that he rides upon, the sky that is above his head, the mountain that faces him, and the earth that is under him, all of this is proof of the power of the Creator and Maker of these things. These things should lead him to see that He is the Lord, the Most Great, the Creator, the Owner, and the Controller of everything. Therefore, He is the God other than Whom none deserves to be worshipped.\nThe Story of Dimam bin Tha`labah\nThese are the things Dimam swore by after questioning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. This can be seen in what Imam Ahmad recorded from Thabit, who reported that Anas said, \"We were prohibited from asking the Messenger of Allah ﷺ anything. Thus, it used to amaze us when an intelligent man from the people of the desert (bedouin Arabs) would come and ask him about something while we were listening. So a man from the people of the desert came and said, `O Muhammad! Verily, your messenger has come to us and he claims that you claim that Allah sent you.' He (the Prophet) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) The man said, Who created the heaven؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah.) The man said, Who created the earth؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah). The man said, `Who erected these mountains and placed in them whatever is in them' He (the Prophet ) replied, ا,(Allah). Then the man said, `By the One Who created the heaven, the earth, and erected these mountains, did Allah send you' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.)

He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) Then the man turned away to leave while saying, `By He Who has sent you with the truth, I will not add anything to these things and I will not decrease anything from them.' The Prophet then said,\n«إِنْ صَدَقَ لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّة»\n(If he has spoken truthfully, he will certainly enter Paradise.)

Concerning Allah's statement,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"A tree from the Hellfire.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, \"It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant).\" Qatadah said, \"The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground.\" Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, \"Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous.\" Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) \"This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.\" Sa`id narrated from Qatadah that he said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but Dari`,) \"This is of the worst, most disgusting and loathsome of foods.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nلاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ\n(Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) This means that the intent in eating it will not be achieved, and nothing harmful will be repelled by it."

      "text": "The Exhortation to look at the Creation of the Camel, the Heaven, the Mountains and the Earth\nAllah commands His servants to look at His creations that prove His power and greatness. He says,\nأَفَلاَ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَى الإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ\n(Do they not look at the camels, how they are created) Indeed it is an amazing creation, and the way it has been fashioned is strange. For it is extremely powerful and strong, yet gentle, carrying heavy loads. It allows itself to be guided by a weak rider. It is eaten, benefit is derived from its hair, and its milk is drunk. They are reminded of this because the most common domestic animal of the Arabs was the camel. Shurayh Al-Qadi used to say, \"Come out with us so that we may look at the camels and how they were created, and at the sky and how it has been raised.\" Meaning, how Allah raised it in such magnificence above the ground. This is as Allah says,\nأَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُواْ إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَـهَا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ\n(Have they not looked at the heaven above them, how we have made it and adorned it and there are no rifts on it) (50:6) Then Allah says,\nوَإِلَى الْجِبَالِ كَيْفَ نُصِبَتْ\n(And at the mountains, how they are rooted) meaning, how they have been erected. For indeed they are firmly affixed so that the earth does not sway with its dwellers. And He made them with the benefits and minerals they contain.\nوَإِلَى الاٌّرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ\n(And at the earth, how it is outspread) meaning, how it has been spread out, extended and made smooth. Thus, He directs the bedouin to consider what he himself witnesses. His camel that he rides upon, the sky that is above his head, the mountain that faces him, and the earth that is under him, all of this is proof of the power of the Creator and Maker of these things. These things should lead him to see that He is the Lord, the Most Great, the Creator, the Owner, and the Controller of everything. Therefore, He is the God other than Whom none deserves to be worshipped.\nThe Story of Dimam bin Tha`labah\nThese are the things Dimam swore by after questioning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. This can be seen in what Imam Ahmad recorded from Thabit, who reported that Anas said, \"We were prohibited from asking the Messenger of Allah ﷺ anything. Thus, it used to amaze us when an intelligent man from the people of the desert (bedouin Arabs) would come and ask him about something while we were listening. So a man from the people of the desert came and said, `O Muhammad! Verily, your messenger has come to us and he claims that you claim that Allah sent you.' He (the Prophet) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) The man said, Who created the heaven؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah.) The man said, Who created the earth؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah). The man said, `Who erected these mountains and placed in them whatever is in them' He (the Prophet ) replied, ا,(Allah). Then the man said, `By the One Who created the heaven, the earth, and erected these mountains, did Allah send you' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger claims that we are obligated to pray five prayers during our day and night.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) The man then said, `By He Who has sent you, did Allah command you with this' He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger also claims that we are obligated to give charity from our wealth.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) Then the man said, `By He Who has sent you, did Allah command you with this' He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger claims that we are obligated to perform pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (the Ka`bah), for whoever is able to find a way there.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) Then the man turned away to leave while saying, `By He Who has sent you with the truth, I will not add anything to these things and I will not decrease anything from them.' The Prophet then said,\n«إِنْ صَدَقَ لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّة»\n(If he has spoken truthfully, he will certainly enter Paradise.) This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.\nThe Messenger is only charged with delivering the Message\nAllah says,\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them -- you are only one who reminds. You are not a Musaytir over them) meaning, \"O Muhammad! Remind the people with what you have been sent with to them.\"\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.) (13:40) Then Allah says,\nلَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(You are not a Musaytir over them.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said, \"You are not a dictator over them.\" This means that you cannot create faith in their hearts. Ibn Zayd said, \"You are not the one who can force them to have faith.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتْى يَقُولُوا: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَّا بِحَقِّهَا، وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»\n(I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allah). So if they say that, they have safeguarded their blood and wealth from me - except for what is rightfully due from it - and their reckoning is with Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.)\" Then he recited,\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them - you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them -) This is how Muslim recorded this Hadith in his Book of Faith, and At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it in their Sunans in the Books of Tafsir. This Hadith can be found in both of the Two Sahihs.\nThe Threat for Whoever turns away from the Truth\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِلاَّ مَن تَوَلَّى وَكَفَرَ\n(Save the one who turns away and disbelieves.) meaning, he turns away from acting upon its pillars, and he disbelieves in the truth with his heart and his tongue. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nفَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى\n(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied and turn away!) (75:31-32) Thus, Allah says,\nفَيْعَذِّبُهُ اللَّهُ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّكْبَرَ\n(Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.) Allah then says,\nإِنَّ إِلَيْنَآ إِيَابَهُمْ\n(Verily, to Us will be their return;) meaning, their place of return and their resort.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُمْ\n(Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.) meaning, `We will reckon their deeds for them and requite them for those deeds.' If they did good, they will receive good, and if they did evil, they will receive evil. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Ghashiyah."

This can be seen in what Imam Ahmad recorded from Thabit, who reported that Anas said, \"We were prohibited from asking the Messenger of Allah ﷺ anything. Thus, it used to amaze us when an intelligent man from the people of the desert (bedouin Arabs) would come and ask him about something while we were listening. So a man from the people of the desert came and said, `O Muhammad! Verily, your messenger has come to us and he claims that you claim that Allah sent you.' He (the Prophet) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) The man said, Who created the heaven؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah.) The man said, Who created the earth؟ He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«الله»\n,(Allah). The man said, `Who erected these mountains and placed in them whatever is in them' He (the Prophet ) replied, ا,(Allah). Then the man said, `By the One Who created the heaven, the earth, and erected these mountains, did Allah send you' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger claims that we are obligated to pray five prayers during our day and night.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) The man then said, `By He Who has sent you, did Allah command you with this' He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger also claims that we are obligated to give charity from our wealth.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) Then the man said, `By He Who has sent you, did Allah command you with this' He (the Prophet ) replied,\n«نَعَم»\n(Yes.) The man then said, `Your messenger claims that we are obligated to perform pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (the Ka`bah), for whoever is able to find a way there.' He (the Prophet ) said,\n«صَدَق»\n(He told the truth.) Then the man turned away to leave while saying, `By He Who has sent you with the truth, I will not add anything to these things and I will not decrease anything from them.' The Prophet then said,\n«إِنْ صَدَقَ لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّة»\n(If he has spoken truthfully, he will certainly enter Paradise.) This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.\nThe Messenger is only charged with delivering the Message\nAllah says,\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them -- you are only one who reminds. You are not a Musaytir over them) meaning, \"O Muhammad! Remind the people with what you have been sent with to them.\"\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.) (13:40) Then Allah says,\nلَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(You are not a Musaytir over them.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said, \"You are not a dictator over them.\" This means that you cannot create faith in their hearts. Ibn Zayd said, \"You are not the one who can force them to have faith.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتْى يَقُولُوا: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَّا بِحَقِّهَا، وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»\n(I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allah). So if they say that, they have safeguarded their blood and wealth from me - except for what is rightfully due from it - and their reckoning is with Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.)\" Then he recited,\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them - you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them -) This is how Muslim recorded this Hadith in his Book of Faith, and At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it in their Sunans in the Books of Tafsir. This Hadith can be found in both of the Two Sahihs.\nThe Threat for Whoever turns away from the Truth\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِلاَّ مَن تَوَلَّى وَكَفَرَ\n(Save the one who turns away and disbelieves.) meaning, he turns away from acting upon its pillars, and he disbelieves in the truth with his heart and his tongue. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nفَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى\n(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied and turn away!) (75:31-32) Thus, Allah says,\nفَيْعَذِّبُهُ اللَّهُ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّكْبَرَ\n(Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.) Allah then says,\nإِنَّ إِلَيْنَآ إِيَابَهُمْ\n(Verily, to Us will be their return;) meaning, their place of return and their resort.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُمْ\n(Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.) meaning, `We will reckon their deeds for them and requite them for those deeds.' If they did good, they will receive good, and if they did evil, they will receive evil. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Ghashiyah."

This Hadith can be found in both of the Two Sahihs.\nThe Threat for Whoever turns away from the Truth\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِلاَّ مَن تَوَلَّى وَكَفَرَ\n(Save the one who turns away and disbelieves.) meaning, he turns away from acting upon its pillars, and he disbelieves in the truth with his heart and his tongue. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nفَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى\n(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied and turn away!) (75:31-32) Thus, Allah says,\nفَيْعَذِّبُهُ اللَّهُ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّكْبَرَ\n(Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.) Allah then says,\nإِنَّ إِلَيْنَآ إِيَابَهُمْ\n(Verily, to Us will be their return;) meaning, their place of return and their resort.\nثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُمْ\n(Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.) meaning, `We will reckon their deeds for them and requite them for those deeds.' If they did good, they will receive good, and if they did evil, they will receive evil. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Ghashiyah."

It is not intended to mean that there is only one spring. So here it refers to springs collectively. Thus, the meaning is that in it (Paradise) are flowing springs.

Upon which will be seated wide-eyed, beautiful maidens. They have mentioned that whenever the friend of Allah wishes to sit on these lofty thrones, they (the thrones) will lower themselves for him.\nوَأَكْوَابٌ مَّوْضُوعَةٌ\n(And cups set at hand.) meaning, drinking containers that are prepared and presented for whoever among their masters (i.e., the people of Paradise) wants them.\nوَنَمَارِقُ مَصْفُوفَةٌ\n(And Namariq set in rows.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"An-Namariq are pillows.\" This was also said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and others.

This is as Allah says,\nلاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً إِلاَّ سَلَـماً\n(They shall not hear therein any Laghw, but only Salam.) (19:62) Allah also says,\nلاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(Free from any Laghw, and free from sin.) (52:23) and He says,\nلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً\n(No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salam! Salam!\" ) (56:25-26) Then Allah continues,\nفِيهَا عَيْنٌ جَارِيَةٌ\n(Therein will be a running spring.) meaning, flowing freely. This is mentioned with the intent of emphasizing affirmation. It is not intended to mean that there is only one spring. So here it refers to springs collectively. Thus, the meaning is that in it (Paradise) are flowing springs. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ تَفَجَّرُ مِنْ تَحْتِ تِلَالِ أَوْ مِنْ تَحْتِ جِبَالِ الْمِسْك»\n(The rivers of Paradise spring forth from beneath hills -- or mountains -- of musk.)\nفِيهَا سُرُرٌ مَّرْفُوعَةٌ\n(Therein will be thrones raised high.) meaning, lofty, delightful, numerous couches, with elevated ceilings. Upon which will be seated wide-eyed, beautiful maidens. They have mentioned that whenever the friend of Allah wishes to sit on these lofty thrones, they (the thrones) will lower themselves for him.\nوَأَكْوَابٌ مَّوْضُوعَةٌ\n(And cups set at hand.) meaning, drinking containers that are prepared and presented for whoever among their masters (i.e., the people of Paradise) wants them.\nوَنَمَارِقُ مَصْفُوفَةٌ\n(And Namariq set in rows.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"An-Namariq are pillows.\" This was also said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and others. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَزَرَابِيُّ مَبْثُوثَةٌ\n(And Zarabi, spread out (Mabthuthah).) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Az-Zarabi are carpets.\" This was also said by Ad-Dahhak and others. Here the word Mabthuthah means placed here and there for whoever would like to sit upon them."
