      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an is a Revelation from Allah and the Universe is His True Creation\nAllah informs that He has revealed the Book to His servant and Messenger Muhammad -- may Allah's blessings be upon him until the Day of Judgement. Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,\nمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ\n(We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,) meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.\nوَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى\n(and for a specified term.) meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease. Allah continues,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ\n(But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.) Meaning, the disbelievers are distracted from what is intended for them. Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that. Therefore, they will soon realize the consequence of their behavior.\nRefuting the Idolators\nAllah then says,\nقُلْ\n(Say) meaning, to these idolators who worship others besides Allah.\nأَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقُواْ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ\n(Think you about all that you invoke besides Allah Show me what they have created of the earth) (46:4) meaning, `show me the place that they have independently created from the earth.'\nأَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ\n(Or have they a share in the heavens) which means that they are not partners in anything in the heavens, nor on earth. They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. `How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him Who guided you to that Who called you to that Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves' Thus, He says,\nائْتُونِى بِكِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَـذَآ\n(Bring me a scripture prior to this) meaning, `bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge,) meaning, `some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'\nإِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful!) meaning, `you have absolutely no evidence for that -- neither textual (from revelation) nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it; (أَوْ أَثَرَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ) \"or something inherited from knowledge\" meaning, `or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge.) \"Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.\" Allah then says,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(And who is more astray than those who invokes besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them) meaning, no one is more misguided than those who invoke idols instead of Allah, asking them for things that they cannot give -- until the Day of Judgment. They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.) This is similar to Allah's saying:\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(They have taken gods beside Allah, that they might give them dignity. No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.) (19:81, 82) meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. (Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)(29:25)"

      "text": "The Qur'an is Allah's True Speech and the Position of the Disbelievers and the Muslims towards it\nAllah says,\nقُلْ\n(Say) meaning, `O Muhammad to these idolators who disbelieve in the Qur'an.'\nأَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ\n(Tell me! If it was) meaning, this Qur'an.\nمِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ\n(from Allah, and you disbelieved in it) meaning, `what do you think that Allah will do to you if this Book that I have come to you with is actually revealed to me from Him in order that I convey it to you, and yet you disbelieve in it and deny it\nوَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ\n((at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar) meaning, `the previous Scriptures that were revealed to the Prophets before me all testify to its truthfulness and authenticity. They have prophecied, well in advance, about things similar to that which this Qur'an informs of.' Concerning Allah's statement,\nفَـَامَنَ\n(and believed) `this person who testified to its truthfulness from the Children of Israel, due to his realization that it was the truth.'\nوَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ\n(while you rejected (the truth)!) `whereas you have arrogantly refused to follow it.' Masruq said: \"That witness believed in his Prophet and Book, while you disbelieved in your Prophet and Book.\"\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Verily, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.) The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes `Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before `Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam. This is similar to the statement of Allah,\nوَإِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَآ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ\n(And when it is recited to them, they say: \"We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, even before it we have been Muslims.\") (28:53) It is also similar to Allah's saying,\nقُلْ ءَامِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُواْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلاٌّذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا - وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَآ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً\n(Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it -- when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration, and they say: \"Exalted is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.\") (17:107-108) It has been narrated from Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, \"I have not heard Allah's Messenger say about anyone walking on the surface of the earth that he is of the people of Jannah -- except for `Abdullah bin Salam. Concerning him the following Ayah was revealed,\nوَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ\n((at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar)\" This has been recorded in the Two Sahihs and An-Nasa'i. Similarly, Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Yusuf bin `Abdullah bin Salam, Hilal bin Yasaf, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said that this refers to `Abdullah bin Salam. Allah then says,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ\n(And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: \"Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!\") which means that those who disbelieve say of those who believe in the Qur'an: \"Had it (the Qur'an) been any good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!\" By that, they meant Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab, may Allah be pleased with them, and others like them of the weak, the male servants, and female servants. The pagans said this only because they thought that they held a high status with Allah, and that He took special care of them. By that, they made a great and obvious error, as Allah says:\nوَكَذلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولواْ أَهَـؤُلاءِ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَآ\n(Thus have We tried some of them with others, that they might say: \"Is it these whom Allah has favored from among us\") (6:53) meaning, they wonder how could those weaklings be the ones who were guided from among them. Thus, Allah says,\nلَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ\n(Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!) Contrary to this is the position of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah: They say about any act or saying that has not been reported from the Companions: \"It is an innovation. If there was any good in it, they would have preceded us in doing it, because they have not left off any of the good characteristics except that they hurried to perform them.\" Allah continues,\nوَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُواْ بِهِ\n(And when they have not been guided by it,) meaning, the Qur'an.\nفَسَيَقُولُونَ هَـذَآ إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ\n(they say: \"This is an ancient falsehood!\") meaning, an old lie. They mean by this that the Qur'an has been quoted and taken from the ancient people, thereby belittling the Qur'an and its followers. This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger said:\n«بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس»\n((Arrogance is) rejecting the truth and belittling the people.) Allah then says,\nوَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَى\n(And before this was the Scripture of Musa) and it was the Tawrah.\nإِمَاماً وَرَحْمَةً وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ\n(as a guide and mercy. And this is a Book) meaning, the Qur'an.\nمُّصَدِّقُ\n(confirming) meaning, that which came before it of the previous Books.\nلِّسَاناً عَرَبِيّاً\n(in the Arabic tongue,) means that it is eloquent and clear.\nلِّيُنذِرَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَبُشْرَى لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings for the doers of good.) meaning, it contains a warning to the dis- believers and glad tidings for the belie- vers. Allah then says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ\n(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is (only) Allah,\" and thereafter stand firm,) The explanation of this has been dis- cussed earlier in Surat As-Sajdah. See 41:30 Allah then says,\nفَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ\n(on them shall be no fear,) meaning, con- cening their future.\nوَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(nor shall they grieve.) meaning, over what they have left behind. Allah continues,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) -- a reward for what they used to do.) meaning, the deeds are a cause for their attaining the mercy and their being engulfed by it -- and Allah knows best."

They mean by this that the Qur'an has been quoted and taken from the ancient people, thereby belittling the Qur'an and its followers. This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger said:\n«بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس»\n((Arrogance is) rejecting the truth and belittling the people.) Allah then says,\nوَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَى\n(And before this was the Scripture of Musa) and it was the Tawrah.\nإِمَاماً وَرَحْمَةً وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ\n(as a guide and mercy. And this is a Book) meaning, the Qur'an.\nمُّصَدِّقُ\n(confirming) meaning, that which came before it of the previous Books.\nلِّسَاناً عَرَبِيّاً\n(in the Arabic tongue,) means that it is eloquent and clear.\nلِّيُنذِرَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَبُشْرَى لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings for the doers of good.) meaning, it contains a warning to the dis- believers and glad tidings for the belie- vers. Allah then says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ\n(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is (only) Allah,\" and thereafter stand firm,) The explanation of this has been dis- cussed earlier in Surat As-Sajdah. See 41:30 Allah then says,\nفَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ\n(on them shall be no fear,) meaning, con- cening their future.\nوَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(nor shall they grieve.) meaning, over what they have left behind. Allah continues,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) -- a reward for what they used to do.) meaning, the deeds are a cause for their attaining the mercy and their being engulfed by it -- and Allah knows best."

The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes `Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before `Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam.

Those who were given knowledge before it -- when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration, and they say: \"Exalted is our Lord!

Allah then says,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ\n(And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: \"Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!\") which means that those who disbelieve say of those who believe in the Qur'an: \"Had it (the Qur'an) been any good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!\" By that, they meant Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab, may Allah be pleased with them, and others like them of the weak, the male servants, and female servants. The pagans said this only because they thought that they held a high status with Allah, and that He took special care of them. By that, they made a great and obvious error, as Allah says:\nوَكَذلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولواْ أَهَـؤُلاءِ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَآ\n(Thus have We tried some of them with others, that they might say: \"Is it these whom Allah has favored from among us\") (6:53) meaning, they wonder how could those weaklings be the ones who were guided from among them. Thus, Allah says,\nلَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ\n(Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!)

      "text": "Allah's Advice about the Parents\nAfter mentioning that one must confess His Oneness, worship Him with sincerity, and remain upright in obeying Him, Allah follows that by giving instructions regarding the parents. These appear together in many places of the Qur'an, such as Allah's saying,\nوَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً\n(Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents.) (17:23) Allah says,\nأَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ\n(Be grateful to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.) (31:14) There are many other Ayat like this as well. Here Allah says,\nوَوَصَّيْنَا الإِنسَـنَ بِوَلِدَيْهِ إِحْسَـناً\n(And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents.) (46:15) meaning, `We have commanded him to treat them well and show compassion towards them. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, that his mother said to him: \"Hasn't Allah commanded that you obey your parents Then I will not eat any food or drink any drink until you disbelieve in Allah.\" Thus she stubbornly abstained from eating and drinking, until they had to open her mouth with a stick. Then this Ayah was revealed,\nوَوَصَّيْنَا الإِنسَـنَ بِوَلِدَيْهِ إِحْسَـناً\n(And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. ) This was also recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers, except for Ibn Majah. Allah continues,\nحَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْهاً\n(His mother bears him with hardship.) which means that the mother suffers hardship because of her child, such as fatigue, sickness, vomiting, heaviness, distress, and other forms of hardship that the pregnant women suffer.\nوَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهاً\n(And she delivers him with hardship.) meaning, she also delivers him with hardship, suffering the pains of labor and their severity.\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً\n(And (the period of) his gestation and weaning is thirty months,) `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, used this Ayah along with the following two Ayat to prove that the minimum period of pregnancy (gestation) is six months:\nوَفِصَالُهُ فِى عَامَيْنِ\n(And his weaning is in two years.) (31:14) and\nوَالْوَلِدَتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَـدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ\n(The mothers suckle their children two complete years -- for those who desire to complete the term of suckling. ) (2:233) This is a strong and valid conclusion, and it was approved by `Uthman and a number of the Companions. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Ba`jah bin `Abdullah Al-Juhani that a man from his tribe (Juhaynah) married a woman from Juhaynah. She delivered a baby after six months. So her husband went to `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. Thus, `Uthman summoned her. When she was getting dressed, her sister started crying. She asked her: \"Why do you cry By Allah, no one has ever approached me (for sexual relations) of Allah's creation except him (my husband). So let Allah decree (for me) as He wills.\" When she was brought before `Uthman, he commanded that she be stoned to death (for adultery). `Ali heard of this, came to `Uthman, and said: \"What are you doing\" He (`Uthman) said: \"She delivered after six months! Can this ever happen\" `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Don't you read the Qur'an\" He said: \"Yes, of course!\" He (`Ali) then said: `Haven't you heard Allah's saying,\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً\n(and his gestation and weaning is thirty months), and;\nحَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ\n( two complete years) (2:233) (Subtracting the two numbers) we are only left with six months.\" `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"By Allah, I did not see that! Bring the woman back.\" But they found that she had already been killed. Ba`jah continued: \"By Allah, no two crows and no two eggs are more similar than that child turned out to be to his father! When his father saw that he said, `By Allah! This is my son without any doubt.' Later on, Allah afflicted him with a skin abscess in his face (because of his false accusation to his wife). It kept eating him up until he died.\" Ibn Abi Hatim related from his father that Farwah bin Abi Al-Maghra' told them that `Ali bin Mushir narrated to them from Dawud bin Abi Hind, who narrated from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When a woman delivers after nine months, the baby will only need twenty-one months of suckling. When she delivers after seven months, the baby will need twenty-three months of suckling. When she delivers after six months, the baby will need two full years of suckling, because Allah says,\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ\n(and his gestation and weaning is thirty months, till when he attains full strength).\" meaning, he becomes strong, youthful, and attains full ability.\nوَبَلَغَ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً\n(and reaches forty years,) meaning, his complete intellect, understanding, and patience reach the level of maturity. It has also been said that usually one will not change his ways once he reaches the age of forty.\nقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِى\n(he says: \"My Lord! Grant me the power and ability) meaning, `inspire me.'\nأَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ الَّتِى أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَى وَالِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَـلِحاً تَرْضَـهُ\n(that I may be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You,) meaning, in the future.\nوَأَصْلِحْ لِى فِى ذُرِّيَّتِى\n(and make my offspring good.) meaning, my offspring and descendants.\nإِنَّى تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَإِنِّى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly, I am one of the Muslims.) This contains an instruction for anyone who reaches forty years of age to renew his repentance and turn to Allah with strong resolution. Allah then says,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ نَتَقَبَّلُ عَنْهُمْ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَنَتَجَاوَزُ عَن سَيْئَـتِهِمْ فِى أَصْحَـبِ الْجَنَّةِ\n(Those are the ones from whom We shall accept the best of what they did and overlook their evil deeds. (They shall be) among the dwellers of Paradise.) meaning, those to whom applies the above description -- those who repent to Allah, turn back to Him, and rectify their shortcomings through repentance and seeking forgiveness - those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their evil deeds. Many of their errors will be forgiven and Allah will accept from them a modest amount of deeds.\nفِى أَصْحَـبِ الْجَنَّةِ\n(among the dwellers of Paradise.) which means that they will be among the dwellers of Paradise. That is Allah's ruling concerning them, as He has promised for those who repent and turn to Him. Thus, He says,\nوَعْدَ الصِّدْقِ الَّذِى كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ\n(That is the promise of truth that they had been promised.)"

(46:15) meaning, `We have commanded him to treat them well and show compassion towards them. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, that his mother said to him: \"Hasn't Allah commanded that you obey your parents Then I will not eat any food or drink any drink until you disbelieve in Allah.\" Thus she stubbornly abstained from eating and drinking, until they had to open her mouth with a stick. Then this Ayah was revealed,\nوَوَصَّيْنَا الإِنسَـنَ بِوَلِدَيْهِ إِحْسَـناً\n(And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. ) This was also recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers, except for Ibn Majah. Allah continues,\nحَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْهاً\n(His mother bears him with hardship.) which means that the mother suffers hardship because of her child, such as fatigue, sickness, vomiting, heaviness, distress, and other forms of hardship that the pregnant women suffer.\nوَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهاً\n(And she delivers him with hardship.) meaning, she also delivers him with hardship, suffering the pains of labor and their severity.\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً\n(And (the period of) his gestation and weaning is thirty months,) `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, used this Ayah along with the following two Ayat to prove that the minimum period of pregnancy (gestation) is six months:\nوَفِصَالُهُ فِى عَامَيْنِ\n(And his weaning is in two years.) (31:14) and\nوَالْوَلِدَتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَـدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ\n(The mothers suckle their children two complete years -- for those who desire to complete the term of suckling. ) (2:233) This is a strong and valid conclusion, and it was approved by `Uthman and a number of the Companions. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Ba`jah bin `Abdullah Al-Juhani that a man from his tribe (Juhaynah) married a woman from Juhaynah. She delivered a baby after six months. So her husband went to `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. Thus, `Uthman summoned her. When she was getting dressed, her sister started crying. She asked her: \"Why do you cry By Allah, no one has ever approached me (for sexual relations) of Allah's creation except him (my husband). So let Allah decree (for me) as He wills.\" When she was brought before `Uthman, he commanded that she be stoned to death (for adultery). `Ali heard of this, came to `Uthman, and said: \"What are you doing\" He (`Uthman) said: \"She delivered after six months! Can this ever happen\" `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Don't you read the Qur'an\" He said: \"Yes, of course!\" He (`Ali) then said: `Haven't you heard Allah's saying,\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً\n(and his gestation and weaning is thirty months), and;\nحَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ\n( two complete years) (2:233) (Subtracting the two numbers) we are only left with six months.\" `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"By Allah, I did not see that! Bring the woman back.\" But they found that she had already been killed. Ba`jah continued: \"By Allah, no two crows and no two eggs are more similar than that child turned out to be to his father! When his father saw that he said, `By Allah! This is my son without any doubt.' Later on, Allah afflicted him with a skin abscess in his face (because of his false accusation to his wife). It kept eating him up until he died.\" Ibn Abi Hatim related from his father that Farwah bin Abi Al-Maghra' told them that `Ali bin Mushir narrated to them from Dawud bin Abi Hind, who narrated from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When a woman delivers after nine months, the baby will only need twenty-one months of suckling. When she delivers after seven months, the baby will need twenty-three months of suckling. When she delivers after six months, the baby will need two full years of suckling, because Allah says,\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَـلُهُ ثَلاَثُونَ شَهْراً حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ\n(and his gestation and weaning is thirty months, till when he attains full strength).\" meaning, he becomes strong, youthful, and attains full ability.\nوَبَلَغَ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً\n(and reaches forty years,) meaning, his complete intellect, understanding, and patience reach the level of maturity. It has also been said that usually one will not change his ways once he reaches the age of forty.\nقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِى\n(he says: \"My Lord! Grant me the power and ability) meaning, `inspire me.'\nأَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ الَّتِى أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَى وَالِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَـلِحاً تَرْضَـهُ\n(that I may be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You,) meaning, in the future.\nوَأَصْلِحْ لِى فِى ذُرِّيَّتِى\n(and make my offspring good.) meaning, my offspring and descendants.\nإِنَّى تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَإِنِّى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n(Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly, I am one of the Muslims.) This contains an instruction for anyone who reaches forty years of age to renew his repentance and turn to Allah with strong resolution. Allah then says,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ نَتَقَبَّلُ عَنْهُمْ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَنَتَجَاوَزُ عَن سَيْئَـتِهِمْ فِى أَصْحَـبِ الْجَنَّةِ\n(Those are the ones from whom We shall accept the best of what they did and overlook their evil deeds. (They shall be) among the dwellers of Paradise.) meaning, those to whom applies the above description -- those who repent to Allah, turn back to Him, and rectify their shortcomings through repentance and seeking forgiveness - those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their evil deeds. Many of their errors will be forgiven and Allah will accept from them a modest amount of deeds.\nفِى أَصْحَـبِ الْجَنَّةِ\n(among the dwellers of Paradise.) which means that they will be among the dwellers of Paradise. That is Allah's ruling concerning them, as He has promised for those who repent and turn to Him. Thus, He says,\nوَعْدَ الصِّدْقِ الَّذِى كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ\n(That is the promise of truth that they had been promised.)"

      "text": "Mention of the Undutiful Children and Their End\nIn the previous Ayat, Allah mentions the dutiful offspring who supplicate for their parents and treat them with kindness. He describes the success and salvation He has prepared for them. Here He connects to that discussion the situation of the wretched offspring who are undutiful toward their parents. Allah says,\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ\n(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! ...\") As for the saying \"Uff\" in this Ayah, it is a general description applying to anyone who says it to his parents. Some people claim that it was revealed about `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr. But this claim is weak and rejected, because `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr embraced Islam after this was revealed. His adherence to Islam was excellent, and he was among the best of his contemporaries. Al-Bukhari recorded from Yusuf bin Mahak that Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) was governor of Hijaz (Western Arabia), appointed by Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. He (Marwan) delivered a speech in which he mentioned Yazid bin Mu`awiyah and urged the people to give a pledge of allegiance after his father. `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said something to him in response to that, upon which Marwan commanded his men: \"Arrest him!\" But he entered `Aishah's house, and they were not able to capture him. Marwan then said: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed:\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى\n(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you!

The Commander of the faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, gave up many of the joys of food and drink and refrained from them while saying, \"I am afraid of being like those whom Allah has reproached and condemned by saying,\nأَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا\n(You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein).\" Abu Mijlaz said: \"Some people will lose good deeds that they had in the worldly life, and they will be told,\nأَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا\n(You received your good things in the life of the world).\" Then Allah says,\nفَالْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ\n(Today, you will be recompensed with the torment of extreme humiliation, because you were arrogant upon the earth without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allah's command.) which indicates that their punishment will be of a type comparable to their deeds.

The Commander of the faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, gave up many of the joys of food and drink and refrained from them while saying, \"I am afraid of being like those whom Allah has reproached and condemned by saying,\nأَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا\n(You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein).\" Abu Mijlaz said: \"Some people will lose good deeds that they had in the worldly life, and they will be told,\nأَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا\n(You received your good things in the life of the world).\" Then Allah says,\nفَالْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ\n(Today, you will be recompensed with the torment of extreme humiliation, because you were arrogant upon the earth without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allah's command.) which indicates that their punishment will be of a type comparable to their deeds. They enjoyed themselves, were arrogant in their denial of the truth, and were involved in sinning and disobedience. Thus, Allah punishes them with extreme humiliation, disgrace, severe pains, continued sorrow, and positions in the terrible depths of Hell -- may Allah protect us from all of that."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an is a Revelation from Allah and the Universe is His True Creation\nAllah informs that He has revealed the Book to His servant and Messenger Muhammad -- may Allah's blessings be upon him until the Day of Judgement. Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,\nمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ\n(We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,) meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.\nوَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى\n(and for a specified term.) meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease. Allah continues,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ\n(But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.) Meaning, the disbelievers are distracted from what is intended for them. Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that. Therefore, they will soon realize the consequence of their behavior.\nRefuting the Idolators\nAllah then says,\nقُلْ\n(Say) meaning, to these idolators who worship others besides Allah.\nأَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقُواْ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ\n(Think you about all that you invoke besides Allah Show me what they have created of the earth) (46:4) meaning, `show me the place that they have independently created from the earth.'\nأَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ\n(Or have they a share in the heavens) which means that they are not partners in anything in the heavens, nor on earth. They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. `How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him Who guided you to that Who called you to that Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves' Thus, He says,\nائْتُونِى بِكِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَـذَآ\n(Bring me a scripture prior to this) meaning, `bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge,) meaning, `some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'\nإِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful!) meaning, `you have absolutely no evidence for that -- neither textual (from revelation) nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it; (أَوْ أَثَرَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ) \"or something inherited from knowledge\" meaning, `or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge.) \"Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.\" Allah then says,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(And who is more astray than those who invokes besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them) meaning, no one is more misguided than those who invoke idols instead of Allah, asking them for things that they cannot give -- until the Day of Judgment. They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.) This is similar to Allah's saying:\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(They have taken gods beside Allah, that they might give them dignity. No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.) (19:81, 82) meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. (Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)(29:25)"

      "text": "Mention of the Undutiful Children and Their End\nIn the previous Ayat, Allah mentions the dutiful offspring who supplicate for their parents and treat them with kindness. He describes the success and salvation He has prepared for them. Here He connects to that discussion the situation of the wretched offspring who are undutiful toward their parents. Allah says,\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ\n(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! ...\") As for the saying \"Uff\" in this Ayah, it is a general description applying to anyone who says it to his parents. Some people claim that it was revealed about `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr. But this claim is weak and rejected, because `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr embraced Islam after this was revealed. His adherence to Islam was excellent, and he was among the best of his contemporaries. Al-Bukhari recorded from Yusuf bin Mahak that Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) was governor of Hijaz (Western Arabia), appointed by Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. He (Marwan) delivered a speech in which he mentioned Yazid bin Mu`awiyah and urged the people to give a pledge of allegiance after his father. `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said something to him in response to that, upon which Marwan commanded his men: \"Arrest him!\" But he entered `Aishah's house, and they were not able to capture him. Marwan then said: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed:\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى\n(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! Do you promise me that I will be raised -- when generations before me have passed\")\" From behind the curtain, `Aishah responded: \"Allah did not reveal any Qur'an in our regard (i.e. the children of Abu Bakr), except for the declaration of my innocence.\" In another report recorded by An-Nasa'i, Muhammad bin Ziyad reported that when Mu`awiyah was soliciting people to pledge allegiance to his son, and Marwan declared: \"This follows the tradition of Abu Bakr and `Umar.\" On hearing this, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said: \"Rather, this is the tradition of Heraclius and Caesar.\" Marwan responded: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed,\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ\n(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you!\")\" When that was conveyed to `A'ishah, she said: \"Marwan is lying! By Allah, that was not revealed about him. If I wish to name the person meant by it, I could. On the other hand, Allah's Messenger ﷺ placed a curse on Marwan's father (Al- Hakam bin Abi Al-`As when Marwan was still in his loins, so Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) is an outcome of Allah's curse.\" As for Allah's statement:\nأَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ\n(Do you promise me that I will be raised) meaning, resurrected.\nوَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى\n(when generations before me have passed) meaning, generations of people have already passed away, and none of them has ever returned to tell (what happened to them)\nوَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ اللَّهَ\n(While they invoke Allah for help) meaning, they ask Allah to guide him, and they say to their son,\nوَيْلَكَ ءَامِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَيَقُولُ مَا هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(\"Woe to you! Believe! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.\" But he says: \"This is nothing but the legends of the ancient.\") Allah then says,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ فِى أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَـسِرِينَ\n(They are those against whom the Word (of torment) has justified among the previous generations of Jinn and mankind that have passed away.Verily, they are ever the losers.) This indicates that all such people will be among their likes and their peers among the disbelievers, who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's saying,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ\n(Those are) after He said,\nوَالَّذِى قَالَ\n(But he who says ) confirms what we have mentioned above that the latter is a general description of a type of people including all those who fall under that description. Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said, \"This applies to the disbelieving, sinful person who is undutiful to his parents and who denies resurrection.\" Allah then says,\nوَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَـتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُواْ\n(And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did,) meaning that there will be degrees of punishment for each of them according to what they did.\nوَلِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(so that He might fully recompense them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.) which means Allah will not be unjust to them even in the amount of a speck of dust or less. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said: \"The levels of the Fire descend, and those of Paradise ascend.\" Allah then says,\nوَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا\n(On the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): \"You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein...\") which means that this will be said to them by way of blame and reprimand.

Allah sent him to the first people of `Ad who inhabited Al-Ahqaf. Ahqaf is plural of Haqf. According to Ibn Zayd, it means a sand dune; and according to `Ikrimah, it means a mountain or a cave. Qatadah said: \"We were informed that `Ad was a tribe in Yemen. They dwelt among sand (hills), and overlooked the sea in a land called Ash-Shihr.\" Under the chapter, \"He Who supplicates should first mention Himself,\" Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Prophet said:\n«يَرْحَمُنَا اللهُ وَأَخَا عَاد»\n(May Allah have mercy on us and the Brother of `Ad.) Allah then says,\nوَقَدْ خَلَتِ النُّذُرُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ\n(And surely, warners had already passed on before him and after him.) meaning, Allah had sent Messengers and warners to the towns surrounding the land of `Ad. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nفَجَعَلْنَـهَا نَكَـلاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا\n(And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded them. ) (2:66) And it is also similar to Allah's saying,\nفَإِنْ أَعْرَضُواْ فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَـعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَـعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ إِذْ جَآءَتْهُمُ الرُّسُلُ مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ\n(But if they turn away, then say: \"I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck `Ad and Thamud. (That occurred) when the Messengers had come to them from before them and after them (saying): \"Worship none but Allah.\") (41:13-14) Allah then says,\nإِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day.) meaning, Hud said this to them (his people), and they responded to him saying,\nأَجِئْتَنَا لِتَأْفِكَنَا عَنْ ءَالِهَتِنَا\n(Have you come to delude us from our gods) meaning, to prevent us.\nعَنْ ءَالِهَتِنَا\n(from our gods)\nفَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ\n(Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!) They sought to hasten Allah's torment and punishment, believing that it will not happen. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nيَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا\n(Those who do not believe in it (the Last Hour) seek to hasten it) (42:18). Hud's response was,\nقَالَ إِنَّمَا الْعِلْمُ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(He said: \"The knowledge (of that) is only with Allah.\") which means, `Allah knows best about you. If you deserve the punishment to be hastened, He will do that to you. As for me, my duty is to deliver my message to you.'\nوَلَـكِنِّى أَرَاكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ\n(But I see that you are a people given to ignorance!) which means, `you have no comprehension or understanding.' Allah then says,\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ\n(Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys,) meaning, when they saw the punishment coming towards them, they thought it to be clouds full of rain. That made them happy and joyful, because they had a drought and needed rain. Allah then said,\nبَلْ هُوَ مَا اسْتَعْجَلْتُم بِهِ رِيحٌ فِيهَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(Nay, but it is that which you were asking to be hastened -- a wind wherein is a painful torment!) meaning, this is the torment that you called for saying, \"Bring to us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful.\"\nتُدَمِّرُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ\n(Destroying every thing) meaning, destroying every part of their land that could normally be destroyed.\nبِأَمْرِ رَبِّهَا\n(by the command of its Lord!) meaning, it had Allah's permission to do that. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nمَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ جَعَلَتْهُ كَالرَّمِيمِ\nd(It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) (51:42) meaning, like something dilapidated (or decrepit). Because of this, Allah says,\nفَأْصْبَحُواْ لاَ يُرَى إِلاَّ مَسَـكِنُهُمْ\n(So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings!) means, all of them were destroyed, and none of them were spared. Allah then says:\nكَذلِكَ نَجْزِي الْقَوْمَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Thus do We recompense the criminal people!) which means that this is Our judgement regarding those who reject Our Messengers and disobey Our commands. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said, \"I never saw Allah's Messenger ﷺ fully laughing so that I would see his uvula. He would only smile.\" She added that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds or wind, that would reflect on his face (as discomfort). She asked him: \"O Allah's Messenger! When the people see clouds, they become happy, hoping that they bring them rain. But I notice that when you see them, displeasure appears on your face.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ، مَا يُؤْمِنُنِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ، قَدْ عُذِّبَ قَوْمٌ بِالرِّيحِ، وَقَدْ رَأَى قَوْمٌ الْعَذَابَ وَقَالُوا: هذَا عَارِضٌ مُمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! What would guarantee to me that they do not bring punishment Some nations had been punished with wind. On seeing the punishment approaching them, a nation once said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain.\") This is also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds on any of the horizons, he would leave whatever he was doing -- even if he was in prayer -- and say:\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا فِيه»\n(O Allah! I seek refuge with you from any harm that it (the cloud) contains.) If Allah removed those clouds, the Prophet would praise Allah, and if rain fell, he would say:\n«اللْهُمَّ صَيِّبًا نَافِعًا»\n(O Allah! Make it pouring and beneficent.) Muslim also recorded in his Sahih from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that when the wind blew, Allah's Messenger ﷺ would say,\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا فِيهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ،وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا فِيهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِه»\n(O Allah! I ask You of its good, the good that it contains, and the good with which it has been sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that it contains, and the evil with which it has been sent.) She added that if the sky became cloudy, his color would change; he would exit, enter, come, and go. When it rained, his anxiety would be relieved. When `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, noticed that, she asked him about it and he said:\n«لَعَلَّهُ يَا عَائِشَةُ كَمَا قَالَ قَوْمُ عَادٍ:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُواْ هَـذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! It could be like what the people of `Ad said, (Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain!\")) We have previously mentioned the story of the destruction of the people of `Ad in both Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud. Thus, there is no need to repeat it here; and verily Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude."

This is similar to Allah's saying,\nيَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا\n(Those who do not believe in it (the Last Hour) seek to hasten it) (42:18). Hud's response was,\nقَالَ إِنَّمَا الْعِلْمُ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(He said: \"The knowledge (of that) is only with Allah.\") which means, `Allah knows best about you. If you deserve the punishment to be hastened, He will do that to you. As for me, my duty is to deliver my message to you.'\nوَلَـكِنِّى أَرَاكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ\n(But I see that you are a people given to ignorance!) which means, `you have no comprehension or understanding.' Allah then says,\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ\n(Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys,) meaning, when they saw the punishment coming towards them, they thought it to be clouds full of rain. That made them happy and joyful, because they had a drought and needed rain. Allah then said,\nبَلْ هُوَ مَا اسْتَعْجَلْتُم بِهِ رِيحٌ فِيهَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(Nay, but it is that which you were asking to be hastened -- a wind wherein is a painful torment!) meaning, this is the torment that you called for saying, \"Bring to us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful.\"\nتُدَمِّرُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ\n(Destroying every thing) meaning, destroying every part of their land that could normally be destroyed.\nبِأَمْرِ رَبِّهَا\n(by the command of its Lord!) meaning, it had Allah's permission to do that. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nمَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ جَعَلَتْهُ كَالرَّمِيمِ\nd(It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) (51:42) meaning, like something dilapidated (or decrepit). Because of this, Allah says,\nفَأْصْبَحُواْ لاَ يُرَى إِلاَّ مَسَـكِنُهُمْ\n(So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings!) means, all of them were destroyed, and none of them were spared. Allah then says:\nكَذلِكَ نَجْزِي الْقَوْمَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Thus do We recompense the criminal people!) which means that this is Our judgement regarding those who reject Our Messengers and disobey Our commands. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said, \"I never saw Allah's Messenger ﷺ fully laughing so that I would see his uvula. He would only smile.\" She added that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds or wind, that would reflect on his face (as discomfort). She asked him: \"O Allah's Messenger! When the people see clouds, they become happy, hoping that they bring them rain. But I notice that when you see them, displeasure appears on your face.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ، مَا يُؤْمِنُنِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ، قَدْ عُذِّبَ قَوْمٌ بِالرِّيحِ، وَقَدْ رَأَى قَوْمٌ الْعَذَابَ وَقَالُوا: هذَا عَارِضٌ مُمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! What would guarantee to me that they do not bring punishment Some nations had been punished with wind. On seeing the punishment approaching them, a nation once said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain.\") This is also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds on any of the horizons, he would leave whatever he was doing -- even if he was in prayer -- and say:\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا فِيه»\n(O Allah! I seek refuge with you from any harm that it (the cloud) contains.) If Allah removed those clouds, the Prophet would praise Allah, and if rain fell, he would say:\n«اللْهُمَّ صَيِّبًا نَافِعًا»\n(O Allah! Make it pouring and beneficent.) Muslim also recorded in his Sahih from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that when the wind blew, Allah's Messenger ﷺ would say,\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا فِيهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ،وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا فِيهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِه»\n(O Allah! I ask You of its good, the good that it contains, and the good with which it has been sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that it contains, and the evil with which it has been sent.) She added that if the sky became cloudy, his color would change; he would exit, enter, come, and go. When it rained, his anxiety would be relieved. When `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, noticed that, she asked him about it and he said:\n«لَعَلَّهُ يَا عَائِشَةُ كَمَا قَالَ قَوْمُ عَادٍ:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُواْ هَـذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! It could be like what the people of `Ad said, (Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain!\")) We have previously mentioned the story of the destruction of the people of `Ad in both Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud. Thus, there is no need to repeat it here; and verily Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude."

Hud's response was,\nقَالَ إِنَّمَا الْعِلْمُ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(He said: \"The knowledge (of that) is only with Allah.\") which means, `Allah knows best about you. If you deserve the punishment to be hastened, He will do that to you. As for me, my duty is to deliver my message to you.'\nوَلَـكِنِّى أَرَاكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ\n(But I see that you are a people given to ignorance!) which means, `you have no comprehension or understanding.' Allah then says,\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ\n(Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys,) meaning, when they saw the punishment coming towards them, they thought it to be clouds full of rain. That made them happy and joyful, because they had a drought and needed rain. Allah then said,\nبَلْ هُوَ مَا اسْتَعْجَلْتُم بِهِ رِيحٌ فِيهَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(Nay, but it is that which you were asking to be hastened -- a wind wherein is a painful torment!) meaning, this is the torment that you called for saying, \"Bring to us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful.\"\nتُدَمِّرُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ\n(Destroying every thing) meaning, destroying every part of their land that could normally be destroyed.\nبِأَمْرِ رَبِّهَا\n(by the command of its Lord!) meaning, it had Allah's permission to do that. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nمَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ جَعَلَتْهُ كَالرَّمِيمِ\nd(It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) (51:42) meaning, like something dilapidated (or decrepit). Because of this, Allah says,\nفَأْصْبَحُواْ لاَ يُرَى إِلاَّ مَسَـكِنُهُمْ\n(So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings!) means, all of them were destroyed, and none of them were spared. Allah then says:\nكَذلِكَ نَجْزِي الْقَوْمَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Thus do We recompense the criminal people!) which means that this is Our judgement regarding those who reject Our Messengers and disobey Our commands. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said, \"I never saw Allah's Messenger ﷺ fully laughing so that I would see his uvula. He would only smile.\" She added that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds or wind, that would reflect on his face (as discomfort). She asked him: \"O Allah's Messenger! When the people see clouds, they become happy, hoping that they bring them rain. But I notice that when you see them, displeasure appears on your face.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ، مَا يُؤْمِنُنِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ، قَدْ عُذِّبَ قَوْمٌ بِالرِّيحِ، وَقَدْ رَأَى قَوْمٌ الْعَذَابَ وَقَالُوا: هذَا عَارِضٌ مُمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! What would guarantee to me that they do not bring punishment Some nations had been punished with wind. On seeing the punishment approaching them, a nation once said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain.\") This is also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ saw clouds on any of the horizons, he would leave whatever he was doing -- even if he was in prayer -- and say:\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا فِيه»\n(O Allah! I seek refuge with you from any harm that it (the cloud) contains.) If Allah removed those clouds, the Prophet would praise Allah, and if rain fell, he would say:\n«اللْهُمَّ صَيِّبًا نَافِعًا»\n(O Allah! Make it pouring and beneficent.) Muslim also recorded in his Sahih from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that when the wind blew, Allah's Messenger ﷺ would say,\n«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا فِيهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ،وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا فِيهَا، وَشَرِّ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِه»\n(O Allah! I ask You of its good, the good that it contains, and the good with which it has been sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that it contains, and the evil with which it has been sent.) She added that if the sky became cloudy, his color would change; he would exit, enter, come, and go. When it rained, his anxiety would be relieved. When `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, noticed that, she asked him about it and he said:\n«لَعَلَّهُ يَا عَائِشَةُ كَمَا قَالَ قَوْمُ عَادٍ:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُواْ هَـذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا»\n(O `A'ishah! It could be like what the people of `Ad said, (Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain!\")) We have previously mentioned the story of the destruction of the people of `Ad in both Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud. Thus, there is no need to repeat it here; and verily Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude."

      "text": "The Story of the Jinns listening to the Qur'an\nImam Ahmad recorded from Az-Zubayr that he commented on the Ayah;\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ\n(And (remember) when We sent towards you a group of the Jinn, to listen to the Qur'an.) \"They were at a place called Nakhlah while Allah's Messenger ﷺ was performing the `Isha' prayer, and\nكَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً\n(they crowded on top of each other to hear him.) (72:19)\" Sufyan said, \"They stood on top of each other like piled wool.\" Ahmad was alone in recording this. Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger ﷺ was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, `We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger ﷺ while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the Fajr prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said: `By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Then they returned to their people and told them: `Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' So Allah revealed to His Prophet ,\nقُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ\n(Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an).) (72:19) Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.\" Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah. When they heard him,\nقَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ\n(They said: \"Listen quietly.\") meaning, hush! They were nine in number, and one of them was called Zawba`ah. So Allah revealed,\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: \"Listen quietly!\" And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:\nضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger ﷺ was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,\nوَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger  ﷺ. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nلِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ\n(...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى\n(And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ\n(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,\nوَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ\n(...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,\nيَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ\n(O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,\nيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ\n(From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said \"both of them\" this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,\nقَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى\n(They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...\") They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, \"Sent down after Musa.\" This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: \"Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).\"\nمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,\nوَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً\n(And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,\nهُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ\n(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.\nيقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ\n(O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad ﷺ has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,\nأَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ\n(Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,\nيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ\n(He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that \"some\" here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.\nوَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,\nوَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ\n(And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.\nوَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ\n(and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best."

Allah continues,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ\n(But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.)

They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. `How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him Who guided you to that Who called you to that Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves' Thus, He says,\nائْتُونِى بِكِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَـذَآ\n(Bring me a scripture prior to this) meaning, `bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge,) meaning, `some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'\nإِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful!) meaning, `you have absolutely no evidence for that -- neither textual (from revelation) nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it; (أَوْ أَثَرَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ) \"or something inherited from knowledge\" meaning, `or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge.) \"Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.\" Allah then says,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(And who is more astray than those who invokes besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them) meaning, no one is more misguided than those who invoke idols instead of Allah, asking them for things that they cannot give -- until the Day of Judgment. They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.) This is similar to Allah's saying:\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(They have taken gods beside Allah, that they might give them dignity. No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.) (19:81, 82) meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. (Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)(29:25)"

      "text": "The Story of the Jinns listening to the Qur'an\nImam Ahmad recorded from Az-Zubayr that he commented on the Ayah;\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ\n(And (remember) when We sent towards you a group of the Jinn, to listen to the Qur'an.) \"They were at a place called Nakhlah while Allah's Messenger ﷺ was performing the `Isha' prayer, and\nكَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً\n(they crowded on top of each other to hear him.) (72:19)\" Sufyan said, \"They stood on top of each other like piled wool.\" Ahmad was alone in recording this. Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger ﷺ was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, `We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger ﷺ while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the Fajr prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said: `By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Then they returned to their people and told them: `Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' So Allah revealed to His Prophet ,\nقُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ\n(Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an).) (72:19) Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.\" Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah. When they heard him,\nقَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ\n(They said: \"Listen quietly.\") meaning, hush! They were nine in number, and one of them was called Zawba`ah. So Allah revealed,\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: \"Listen quietly!\" And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:\nضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger ﷺ was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,\nوَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger  ﷺ. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nلِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ\n(...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى\n(And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ\n(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,\nوَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ\n(...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,\nيَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ\n(O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,\nيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ\n(From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said \"both of them\" this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,\nقَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى\n(They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...\") They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, \"Sent down after Musa.\" This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: \"Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).\"\nمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,\nوَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً\n(And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,\nهُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ\n(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.\nيقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ\n(O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad ﷺ has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,\nأَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ\n(Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,\nيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ\n(He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that \"some\" here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.\nوَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,\nوَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ\n(And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.\nوَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ\n(and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best."

So Allah revealed,\nوَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: \"Listen quietly!\" And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:\nضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger ﷺ was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,\nوَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ\n(they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger  ﷺ. This is similar to Allah's saying,\nلِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ\n(...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى\n(And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ\n(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,\nوَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ\n(...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,\nيَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ\n(O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,\nيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ\n(From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said \"both of them\" this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,\nقَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى\n(They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...\") They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, \"Sent down after Musa.\" This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: \"Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).\"\nمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,\nوَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً\n(And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,\nهُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ\n(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,\nيَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ\n(it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,\nوَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.\nيقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ\n(O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad ﷺ has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,\nأَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ\n(Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,\nيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ\n(He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that \"some\" here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.\nوَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,\nوَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ\n(And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.\nوَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ\n(and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.\nأُوْلَـئِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ\n(Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best."

(Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)(29:25)"

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an is a Revelation from Allah and the Universe is His True Creation\nAllah informs that He has revealed the Book to His servant and Messenger Muhammad -- may Allah's blessings be upon him until the Day of Judgement. Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,\nمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ\n(We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,) meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.\nوَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى\n(and for a specified term.) meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease. Allah continues,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ\n(But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.) Meaning, the disbelievers are distracted from what is intended for them. Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that. Therefore, they will soon realize the consequence of their behavior.\nRefuting the Idolators\nAllah then says,\nقُلْ\n(Say) meaning, to these idolators who worship others besides Allah.\nأَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقُواْ مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ\n(Think you about all that you invoke besides Allah Show me what they have created of the earth) (46:4) meaning, `show me the place that they have independently created from the earth.'\nأَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ\n(Or have they a share in the heavens) which means that they are not partners in anything in the heavens, nor on earth. They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. `How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him Who guided you to that Who called you to that Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves' Thus, He says,\nائْتُونِى بِكِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَـذَآ\n(Bring me a scripture prior to this) meaning, `bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge,) meaning, `some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'\nإِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(if you are truthful!) meaning, `you have absolutely no evidence for that -- neither textual (from revelation) nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it; (أَوْ أَثَرَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ) \"or something inherited from knowledge\" meaning, `or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,\nأَوْ أَثَـرَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ\n(or some trace of knowledge.) \"Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.\" Allah then says,\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(And who is more astray than those who invokes besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them) meaning, no one is more misguided than those who invoke idols instead of Allah, asking them for things that they cannot give -- until the Day of Judgment. They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.) This is similar to Allah's saying:\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(They have taken gods beside Allah, that they might give them dignity. No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.) (19:81, 82) meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. (Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ\n(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)(29:25)"

In this statement of theirs, they have lied, invented a falsehood, went astray and disbelieved.\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ\n(Or they say: \"He has fabricated it.\" ) They are referring to Muhammad . Allah responds saying,\nقُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً\n(Say: \"If I have fabricated it, you have no power to support me against Allah...\") which means, `if I lie against Allah and falsely claim that He sent me when He actually had not, then He would punish me with a severe punishment. No one on the earth -- you or anyone else -- would then be able to protect me from Him.' It is similar to Allah's saying,\nقُلْ إِنِّى لَن يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ اللَّهِ أَحَدٌ وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِسَـلَـتِهِ\n(Say: \"None can protect me from Allah, nor would I find a refuge except in Him. (My duty) is only to convey from Allah and (deliver) His Messages. \") (72:22-23) Allah says,\nوَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ الاٌّقَاوِيلِ - لأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُ بِالْيَمِينِ - ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ الْوَتِينَ - فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَـجِزِينَ\n(And if he made up a false saying concerning Us, We surely would have seized him by the right hand. Then we would have cut off his life artery. And none of you could withhold Us from (punishing) him.) (69:44-47) Thus, Allah says here,\nقُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ كَفَى بِهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ\n(Say: \"If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allah. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur'an)! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you!...\") This is a severe threat, intimidation and warning for them. Allah then says,\nوَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.) This is an encouragement for them to repent and turn to Allah. It means, `despite all of this, if you turn back and repent, Allah will accept your repentance, pardon you, forgive you, and have mercy upon on.' This is similar to Allah's saying in Surat Al-Furqan,\nوَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً - قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً\n(And they say: \"(This Book is) legends of the ancients that he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\" Say: \"It has been sent down by the One Who knows every secret within the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\") (25:5-6) Allah then says,\nقُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ\n(Say: \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers...\") which means, `I am not the first Messenger who ever came to the world. Rather, Messengers came before me. Therefore, I am not an unprecedented incident that should cause you all to reject me and doubt my being sent to you. Indeed, Allah has sent before me all of the Prophets to various nations.' Allah then says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرِى مَا يُفْعَلُ بِى وَلاَ بِكُمْ\n(nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"It (this Ayah) was followed in revelation by,\nلِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ\n(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). Similarly, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said that this Ayah was abrogated by the Ayah;\nلِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ\n(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). They said that when the latter Ayah was revealed, one of the Muslims said to Allah's Messenger , \"Allah has declared what He will do for you. But what will He do for us\" Then Allah revealed;\nلِّيُدْخِلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ\n(That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow). This is what they said. That which has been confirmed in the Sahih is that the believers said, \"May you enjoy that, O Allah's Messenger! But what do we get\" So Allah revealed this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit, reported that Umm Al-`Ala' -- a woman from the Ansar who had given her pledge of loyalty to Allah's Messenger -- said, \"When the Ansar drew lots regarding taking in the Muhajirun to dwell with them, our lot was to have `Uthman bin Maz`un. Later, `Uthman fell sick in our house, so we nursed him until he died, and we wrapped him in his garments (for burial). Allah's Messenger then came in, and I said, `O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Allah have mercy on you. I bear witness that Allah has indeed honored you.' Allah's Messenger asked,\n«وَمَا يُدْرِيكِ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى أَكْرَمَه»\n(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, `I do not know -- may my father and mother both be ransoms for you!' Allah's Messenger then said,\n«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ،وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْرَ. وَاللهِ مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي»\n(As for him, certainty (death) has reached him from his Lord, and I surely wish well for him. But by Allah, even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to me (after death).) I then said, `Never will I claim a person to be pious after this.' This incident caused me some distress, and I went to sleep thereafter. I saw in my dream that `Uthman owned a running water spring. I went to Allah's Messenger and told him about that. Allah's Messenger said,\n«ذَاكِ عَمَلُه»\n(That was his (good) deeds.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith but Muslim did not. In one of the narrations, Allah's Messenger said,\n«مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِه»\n(Even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to him.) This and similar texts indicate that it is not allowed to declare that a specific person will enter Jannah except for those who were distinctly indicated by Allah or his Messenger . Examples of those are the Ten, Ibn Sallam, Al-Ghumaysa', Bilal, Suraqah, `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Haram (Jabir's father), the Seventy Recitors (of Qur'an) who were assassinated near the Well of Ma`unah, Zayd bin Harithah, Ja`far, Ibn Rawahah, and other similar individuals, may Allah be pleased with them. Allah then says,\nإِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَى إِلَىَّ\n(I only follow that which is revealed to me, ) which means, `I only follow what Allah has revealed to me of the revelation.'\nوَمَآ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(and I am but a plain warner.) meaning, `my warnings are obvious to every person with sound intellect and reason.' And Allah knows best."

Truly, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\") (25:5-6) Allah then says,\nقُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ\n(Say: \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers...\") which means, `I am not the first Messenger who ever came to the world. Rather, Messengers came before me. Therefore, I am not an unprecedented incident that should cause you all to reject me and doubt my being sent to you. Indeed, Allah has sent before me all of the Prophets to various nations.' Allah then says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرِى مَا يُفْعَلُ بِى وَلاَ بِكُمْ\n(nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"It (this Ayah) was followed in revelation by,\nلِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ\n(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). Similarly, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said that this Ayah was abrogated by the Ayah;\nلِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ\n(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). They said that when the latter Ayah was revealed, one of the Muslims said to Allah's Messenger , \"Allah has declared what He will do for you. But what will He do for us\" Then Allah revealed;\nلِّيُدْخِلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ\n(That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow). This is what they said. That which has been confirmed in the Sahih is that the believers said, \"May you enjoy that, O Allah's Messenger! But what do we get\" So Allah revealed this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit, reported that Umm Al-`Ala' -- a woman from the Ansar who had given her pledge of loyalty to Allah's Messenger -- said, \"When the Ansar drew lots regarding taking in the Muhajirun to dwell with them, our lot was to have `Uthman bin Maz`un. Later, `Uthman fell sick in our house, so we nursed him until he died, and we wrapped him in his garments (for burial). Allah's Messenger then came in, and I said, `O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Allah have mercy on you. I bear witness that Allah has indeed honored you.' Allah's Messenger asked,\n«وَمَا يُدْرِيكِ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى أَكْرَمَه»\n(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, `I do not know -- may my father and mother both be ransoms for you!' Allah's Messenger then said,\n«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ،وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْرَ. وَاللهِ مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي»\n(As for him, certainty (death) has reached him from his Lord, and I surely wish well for him. But by Allah, even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to me (after death).) I then said, `Never will I claim a person to be pious after this.' This incident caused me some distress, and I went to sleep thereafter. I saw in my dream that `Uthman owned a running water spring. I went to Allah's Messenger and told him about that. Allah's Messenger said,\n«ذَاكِ عَمَلُه»\n(That was his (good) deeds.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith but Muslim did not. In one of the narrations, Allah's Messenger said,\n«مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِه»\n(Even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to him.) This and similar texts indicate that it is not allowed to declare that a specific person will enter Jannah except for those who were distinctly indicated by Allah or his Messenger . Examples of those are the Ten, Ibn Sallam, Al-Ghumaysa', Bilal, Suraqah, `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Haram (Jabir's father), the Seventy Recitors (of Qur'an) who were assassinated near the Well of Ma`unah, Zayd bin Harithah, Ja`far, Ibn Rawahah, and other similar individuals, may Allah be pleased with them. Allah then says,\nإِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَى إِلَىَّ\n(I only follow that which is revealed to me, ) which means, `I only follow what Allah has revealed to me of the revelation.'\nوَمَآ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(and I am but a plain warner.) meaning, `my warnings are obvious to every person with sound intellect and reason.' And Allah knows best."
