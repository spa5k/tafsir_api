  "text": "Foods that were Prohibited for the Jews Because of their Transgression\nAllah says, We forbade for the Jews every bird and animal with undivided hoof, such as the camel, ostrich, duck and goose. Allah said here,\nوَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ وَالْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَآ\n(and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep...) The Jews used to forbid these types of foods saying that Isra'il, or Ya`qub, used to forbid them for himself so they too forbid them. This was mentioned by As-Suddi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,\nإِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَآ\n(except what adheres to their backs) refers to the fat that clings to their backs. Allah said next,\nأَوِ الْحَوَايَآ\n(or their Hawaya) that is, the entrails, according to Abu Ja`far bin Jarir. He also said, \"The meaning here is, `And from ox and sheep, We forbade their fat for the Jews, except the fat on their backs and what the entrails carry.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that, Ibn `Abbas said that the, Hawaya, are the entrails. Similar was reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak. Allah's statement,\nأَوْ مَا اخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ\n(....or is mixed up with a bone.) means, We allowed the Jews the fat that is mixed with bones. Ibn Jurayj commented, \"The fat on the rump that is mixed with the tailbone was allowed for them, and also the fat on the legs, head, eyes and what adheres to the bones.\" As-Suddi said similarly. Allah said,\nذَلِكَ جَزَيْنَـهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ\n(Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion.) meaning, We imposed this restriction on them as recompense for their rebellion and defying Our commandments. Allah said in another Ayah,\nفَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَـتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً\n(For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them -- and for their hindering many from Allah's way) 4:160. Allah's statement,\nوِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ\n(And verily, We are Truthful.) means, We were justified in the penalty We gave them. Ibn Jarir commented, \"We are Truthful in what We informed you of, O Muhammad; Our forbidding these foods for them, not as they claimed, that Israel merely forbade these things for himself (so they imitated him, they claimed).\"\nThe Tricks of the Jews, and Allah's Curse\n`Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated, \"When `Umar bin Al-Khattab was told that Samurah sold liquor, he commented, `May Allah fight Samurah! Did he not know that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّحُومُ فَجَمَلُوهَا فَبَاعُوهَا»\n(May Allah curse the Jews! The fats were forbidden for them, so they melted the fat and sold it.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"In the year of the victory of Makkah, I heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ saying;\n«إِنَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ حَرَّمَ بَيْعَ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْتَةِ وَالْخِنْزِيرِ وَالْأَصْنَام»\n(Allah and His Messenger have forbidden selling alcoholic drinks (intoxicants), dead animals, swine and idols.) He was asked, `What about the fat of dead animals They are used to dye skins, paint ships and are used as light by the people.' He said,\n«لَا هُوَ حَرَام»\n(No, it is still unlawful.) He then said,\n«قَاتَلَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ إِنَّ اللهَ لَمَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهَا جَمَلُوهُ ثُمَّ بَاعُوهُ وَأَكَلُوا ثَمَنَه»\n(May Allah fight the Jews! When Allah forbade them the fats of animals, they melted the fat, sold it and ate its price.)\" The Group recorded this Hadith.",
