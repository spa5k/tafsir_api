  "text": "أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَكُمْ\n(Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight.) just as He gave these senses to you. In another Ayah, Allah said;\nهُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ\n(It is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing, seeing.) 67:23. The Ayah above might also mean that Allah will not allow the disbelievers to benefit from these senses in religious terms. This is why He said next,\nوَخَتَمَ عَلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ\n(and sealed up your hearts,.) He also said in other Ayat,\nأَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ والاٌّبْصَـرَ\n(Or who owns hearing and sight) 10:31, and,\nوَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَحُولُ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَقَلْبِهِ\n(And know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart.) Allah said;\nمَّنْ إِلَـهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ\n(Is there a god other than Allah who could restore them to you) Meaning, is there anyone except Allah who is able to give you back these senses if Allah took them from you Only Allah is able to do so, and this is why He said here,\nانْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الاٌّيَـتِ\n(See how variously We explain the Ayat,) and make them plain and clear, testifying to Allah's Oneness in lordship and that those worshipped besides Him are all false and unworthy.\nثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ\n(yet they turn aside.) After this explanation, they still turn away from the truth and hinder people from following it. Allah's statement,\nقُلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ بَغْتَةً\n(Say: \"Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly...\") means, while you are unaware -- or during the night -- striking you all of a sudden,\nأَوْ جَهْرَةً\n(or openly) during the day, or publicly,\nهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ\n(will any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people) This torment only strikes those who commit injustice against themselves by associating others with Allah, while those who worship Allah alone without partners will be saved from it, and they will have no fear or sorrow. In another Ayah, Allah said;\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُواْ إِيمَـنَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ\n(It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm, (wrong or Shirk).) 6:82 Allah's statement,\nوَمَا نُرْسِلُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ\n(And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as warners.) means, the Messengers ﷺ bring good news to Allah's servants, as well as, command all that is good and righteous. They also warn those who disbelieve in Allah of His anger and of all types of torment. Allah said,\nفَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ\n(So whosoever believes and does righteous good deeds.) meaning, whoever believes in his heart with what the Messengers were sent with and makes his works righteous by imitating them;\nفَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ\n(upon such shall come no fear,) concerning the future,\nوَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\n(nor shall they grieve.) about what they missed in the past and left behind them in this world. Certainly, Allah will be the Wali and Protector over what they left behind. Allah said next,\nوَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ الْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ\n(But those who reject Our Ayat, the torment will strike them for their rebelling.) The torment will strike them because of disbelieving in the Message of the Messengers, defying Allah's commands, committing what He prohibited and transgressing His set limits.",
