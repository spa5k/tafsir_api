  "text": "Most People are Misguided\nAllah states that most of the people of the earth, are misguided. Allah said in other Ayat,\nوَلَقَدْ ضَلَّ قَبْلَهُمْ أَكْثَرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(And indeed most of the men of old went astray before them.) 37:71 and,\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you eagerly desire it.)12:103 They are misguided, yet they have doubts about their way, and they rely on wishful thinking and delusions.\nإِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ\n(They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie.) Thus, they fulfill Allah's decree and decision concerning them,\nهُوَ أَعْلَمُ مَن يَضِلُّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ\n(It is He Who knows best who strays from His way.) and facilitates that for him,\nوَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ\n(And He knows best the rightly guided.) He facilitates that for them, all of them are facilitated for what He created them.\nفَكُلُواْ مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُم بِآيَـتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ",
