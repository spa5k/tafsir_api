  "text": "The Command to Follow the Revelation\nAllah commands His Messenger and those who followed his path,\nاتَّبِعْ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ\n(Follow what has been inspired to you from your Lord,) meaning, follow it, obey it and act according to it. What has been revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth, no doubt, and there is no deity worthy of worship except Him,\nوَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(and turn aside from the idolators) meaning, forgive them, be forbearing and endure their harm until Allah brings relief to you, supports you and makes you triumphant over them. Know -- O Muhammad -- that there is a wisdom behind misleading the idolators, and that had Allah willed, He would have directed all people to guidance,\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكُواْ\n(Had Allah willed, they would not have taken others besides Him in worship.) Allah's is the perfect will and wisdom in all decrees and decisions, and He is never questioned about what He does, while they all will be questioned. Allah's statement,\nوَمَا جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً\n(And We have not made you Hafiz over them.) means, a watcher who observes their statements and deeds,\nوَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ\n(Nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs. ) or to control their provision. Rather, your only job is to convey, just as Allah said,\nفَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ\n(So remind them, you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.) 88:21-22 and,\nفَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ\n(Your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning.) 13:40",
