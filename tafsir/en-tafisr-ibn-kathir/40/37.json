  "text": "How Fir`awn mocked the Lord of Musa\nAllah tells us of the arrogant and hostile defiance of Fir`awn and his rejection of Musa, when he commanded his minister Haman to build him a tower, i.e., a tall, high, strong fortress. He built it of bricks made from baked clay, as Allah says:\nفَأَوْقِدْ لِى يَهَـمَـنُ عَلَى الطِّينِ فَاجْعَل لِّى صَرْحاً\n(So kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a lofty tower) (28:38).\nلَّعَـلِّى أَبْلُغُ الاٌّسْبَـبَأَسْبَـبَ السَّمَـوَتِ\n(that I may arrive at the ways -- the ways of the heavens,) Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Salih said, \"The gates of the heavens.\" Or it was said, the ways of the heavens.\nفَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَى إِلَـهِ مُوسَى وَإِنِّى لاّظُنُّهُ كَـذِباً\n(and I may look upon the God of Musa, but verily, I think him to be a liar.) Because of his disbelief and defiance, he did not believe that Allah had sent Musa to him. Allah says:\nوَكَـذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوءُ عَمَلِهِ وَصُدَّ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ\n(Thus it was made fair seeming, in Fir`awn's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the path;) means, this act of his building the tower, by means of which he wanted to deceive his people and make them think that he could prove that Musa was lying. Allah says:\nوَمَا كَـيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلاَّ فِى تَبَابٍ\n(and the plot of Fir`awn led to nothing but loss and destruction.) Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid said, \"Meaning nothing but ruin.\"",
