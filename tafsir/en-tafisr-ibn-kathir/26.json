Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

When their brother Nuh said to them: \"Will you not have Taqwa\") meaning, `do you not fear Allah when you worship others instead of Him'\nإِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ\n(I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.) means, `I am the Messenger of Allah to you, faithfully fulfilling the mission with which Allah has sent me. I convey the Messages of my Lord to you, and I do not add anything to them or take anything away from them.,\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ وَمَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ\n(So have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it;) means, `I do not want any payment for the advice I give you; I will save my reward for it with Allah. '\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ\n(So have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `It is clear to you that I am telling the truth and that I am faithfully fulfilling the mission with which Allah has entrusted me.'"

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

His people used to live in the Ahqaf, curved sand-hills near Hadramawt, on the borders of Yemen. They lived after the time of Nuh, as Allah says in Surat Al-A`raf:\nوَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً\n(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature) (7:69). This refers to the fact that they were physically strong and well-built, and very violent, and very tall; they had also been given a great deal of provisions, wealth, gardens, rivers, sons, crops and fruits. Yet despite all of that, they worshipped others besides Allah. So Allah sent Hud, one of their own, as a Messenger bringing them good news and delivering warnings. He called them to worship Allah alone, and he warned them of Allah's wrath and punishment if they were to go against him and treating him harshly. He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`. In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,\nتَعْبَثُونَ\n(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:\nوَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'\nوَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ\n(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ\n(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.' Then Hud began reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them.

He has aided you with cattle and children, and gardens and springs. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) meaning, `if you disbelieve and oppose (your Prophet).' So he called them to Allah with words of encouragement and words of warning, but it was to no avail.\nقَالُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُنْ مِّنَ الْوَعِظِينَ - إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ"

His people used to live in the Ahqaf, curved sand-hills near Hadramawt, on the borders of Yemen. They lived after the time of Nuh, as Allah says in Surat Al-A`raf:\nوَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً\n(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature) (7:69). This refers to the fact that they were physically strong and well-built, and very violent, and very tall; they had also been given a great deal of provisions, wealth, gardens, rivers, sons, crops and fruits. Yet despite all of that, they worshipped others besides Allah. So Allah sent Hud, one of their own, as a Messenger bringing them good news and delivering warnings. He called them to worship Allah alone, and he warned them of Allah's wrath and punishment if they were to go against him and treating him harshly. He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`. In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,\nتَعْبَثُونَ\n(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:\nوَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'\nوَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ\n(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ\n(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.' Then Hud began reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them. He said:\nوَاتَّقُواْ الَّذِى أَمَدَّكُمْ بِمَا تَعْلَمُونَ - أَمَدَّكُمْ بِأَنْعَـمٍ وَبَنِينَ - وَجَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And have Taqwa of Him, Who has aided you with all that you know. He has aided you with cattle and children, and gardens and springs. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) meaning, `if you disbelieve and oppose (your Prophet).' So he called them to Allah with words of encouragement and words of warning, but it was to no avail.\nقَالُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُنْ مِّنَ الْوَعِظِينَ - إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ"

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`. In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:\nأَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً\n(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,\nتَعْبَثُونَ\n(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:\nوَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"\nلَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ\n(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'\nوَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ\n(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.\nفَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ\n(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.' Then Hud began reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them. He said:\nوَاتَّقُواْ الَّذِى أَمَدَّكُمْ بِمَا تَعْلَمُونَ - أَمَدَّكُمْ بِأَنْعَـمٍ وَبَنِينَ - وَجَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(And have Taqwa of Him, Who has aided you with all that you know. He has aided you with cattle and children, and gardens and springs. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) meaning, `if you disbelieve and oppose (your Prophet).' So he called them to Allah with words of encouragement and words of warning, but it was to no avail.\nقَالُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُنْ مِّنَ الْوَعِظِينَ - إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ"

And we are not believers in you) (11:53). This is how it was, as Allah says:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe) (2:6).\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe) (10:96-97). And they said:\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients.) Some scholars read this: \"Khalq\". According to Ibn Mas`ud and according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas -- as reported from Al-`Awfi -- and `Alqamah and Mujahid, they meant, \"What you have brought to us is nothing but the tales (Akhlaq) of the ancients.\" This is like what the idolators of Quraysh said:\nوَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً\n(And they say: \"Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\") (25:5) And Allah said:\nوَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ افْتَرَاهُ وَأَعَانَهُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ ءَاخَرُونَ فَقَدْ جَآءُوا ظُلْماً وَزُوراً وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(Those who disbelieve say: \"This is nothing but a lie that he has invented, and others have helped him in it. In fact, they have produced an injustice and a lie.\" And they say: \"Tales of the ancients...\") (25:4-5)\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(And when it is said to them: \"What is it that your Lord has sent down\" They say: \"Tales of the ancient!\") (16:24). Some other scholars recited it,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients,) \"as Khuluq,\" meaning their religion. What they were following was the religion of the ancients, their fathers and grandfathers, as if they were saying: \"We are following them, we will live as they lived and die as they died, and there will be no resurrection and no judgement.\" Hence they said:\nوَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ\n(And we are not going to be punished.) Allah's saying;\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ\n(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold. Thus the means of their destruction was suited to their nature, for they were the strongest and fiercest of people, so Allah overpowered them with something that was even stronger and fiercer than them, as Allah says:\nأَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ\n(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad of Iram Possesors of the pillars) (89:6-7). This refers to the former `Ad, as Allah says:\nوَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الاٍّولَى\n(And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) (53:50). They were descendents of Iram bin Sam bin Nuh,\nذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ\n(Possesors of the pillars) They used to live among pillars. Those who claim that Iram was a city take this idea from Isra'iliyyat narrations, from the words of Ka`b and Wahb, but there is no real basis for that. Allah says:\nالَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ\n(The like of which were not created in the land) (89:8). meaning, nothing like this tribe was created in terms of might, power and tyranny. If what was meant was a city, it would have said, \"The like of which was not built in the land.\" And Allah says:\nفَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ\n(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) (41:15) And Allah says:\nوَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ\n(And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!) until His saying:\nحُسُوماً\n(in succession) (69:6-7) meaning, consecutively (i.e., seven nights and eight days).\nفَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ\n(so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms!) (69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all.\nإِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لاَ يُؤَخَّرُ\n(Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4). Allah says here:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ\n(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.)"

This refers to the former `Ad, as Allah says:\nوَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الاٍّولَى\n(And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) (53:50). They were descendents of Iram bin Sam bin Nuh,\nذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ\n(Possesors of the pillars) They used to live among pillars. Those who claim that Iram was a city take this idea from Isra'iliyyat narrations, from the words of Ka`b and Wahb, but there is no real basis for that. Allah says:\nالَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ\n(The like of which were not created in the land) (89:8). meaning, nothing like this tribe was created in terms of might, power and tyranny. If what was meant was a city, it would have said, \"The like of which was not built in the land.\" And Allah says:\nفَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ\n(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) (41:15) And Allah says:\nوَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ\n(And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!) until His saying:\nحُسُوماً\n(in succession) (69:6-7) meaning, consecutively (i.e., seven nights and eight days).\nفَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ\n(so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms!) (69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all.\nإِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لاَ يُؤَخَّرُ\n(Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4).

Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

In fact, they have produced an injustice and a lie.\" And they say: \"Tales of the ancients...\") (25:4-5)\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(And when it is said to them: \"What is it that your Lord has sent down\" They say: \"Tales of the ancient!\") (16:24). Some other scholars recited it,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients,) \"as Khuluq,\" meaning their religion. What they were following was the religion of the ancients, their fathers and grandfathers, as if they were saying: \"We are following them, we will live as they lived and die as they died, and there will be no resurrection and no judgement.\" Hence they said:\nوَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ\n(And we are not going to be punished.) Allah's saying;\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ\n(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold. Thus the means of their destruction was suited to their nature, for they were the strongest and fiercest of people, so Allah overpowered them with something that was even stronger and fiercer than them, as Allah says:\nأَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ\n(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad of Iram Possesors of the pillars) (89:6-7). This refers to the former `Ad, as Allah says:\nوَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الاٍّولَى\n(And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) (53:50). They were descendents of Iram bin Sam bin Nuh,\nذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ\n(Possesors of the pillars) They used to live among pillars. Those who claim that Iram was a city take this idea from Isra'iliyyat narrations, from the words of Ka`b and Wahb, but there is no real basis for that. Allah says:\nالَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ\n(The like of which were not created in the land) (89:8). meaning, nothing like this tribe was created in terms of might, power and tyranny. If what was meant was a city, it would have said, \"The like of which was not built in the land.\" And Allah says:\nفَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ\n(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) (41:15) And Allah says:\nوَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍ\n(And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!) until His saying:\nحُسُوماً\n(in succession) (69:6-7) meaning, consecutively (i.e., seven nights and eight days).\nفَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ\n(so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms!) (69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all.\nإِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لاَ يُؤَخَّرُ\n(Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4). Allah says here:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ\n(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.)"

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up.

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud, and in Surat Al-Hijr, where Allah commanded him to take his family at night, except for his wife, and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people. So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up.

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)\nقَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:\nإِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا\n(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:\nأَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ\n(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:\nفَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants."

      "text": "The Response of Shu`ayb's People, Their Disbelief in Him and the coming of the Punishment upon Them\nAllah tells us how his people responded, and how it was like the response of Thamud to their Messenger -- for they were of like mind -- when they said:\nإِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ\n(You are only one of those bewitched!) meaning, `you are one of those who are affected by witchcraft.'\nوَمَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ\n(You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!) means, `we think you are deliberately lying to us in what you say, and Allah has not sent you to us.'\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) Ad-Dahhak said: \"One side of the heavens.\" Qatadah said: \"A piece of the heaven.\" As-Suddi said: \"A punishment from heaven.\" This is like what the Quraysh said, as Allah tells us:\nوَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا\n(And they say: \"We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) until:\nأَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً\n(Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face.\") (17:90-92)\nوَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)\nقَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:\nإِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا\n(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:\nأَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ\n(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:\nفَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants."

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)\nقَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:\nفَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:\nإِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:\nلَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا\n(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:\nأَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ\n(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:\nفَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).\nوَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ\n(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:\nفَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ\n(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:\nفَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ\n(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an and the Disbelievers turning away;\nThey could be compelled to believe if Allah so willed At the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

When every sinner and evildoer sees his punishment, he will feel intense regret. Such was the case of Fir`awn, when Musa prayed against him:\nرَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ ءاتَيْتَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلاّهُ زِينَةً وَأَمْوَالاً فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا\n(Our Lord! \"You have indeed bestowed on Fir`awn and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world) until:\nقَالَ قَدْ أُجِيبَتْ دَّعْوَتُكُمَا\n((Allah) said: \"Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted.\") (10:88-89). This supplication had an effect on Fir`awn: he did not believe until he saw the painful torment:\nحَتَّى إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ الْغَرَقُ قَالَ ءَامَنتُ أَنَّهُ لا إِلِـهَ إِلاَّ الَّذِى ءَامَنَتْ بِهِ بَنواْ إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(till when drowning overtook him, he said: \"I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe.\") until:\nوَكُنتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(and you were one of the mischief-makers) (10:90-91). And Allah says:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ\n(so when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah Alone...\") (40:84-85).\nأَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ\n(Would they then wish for Our torment to be hastened on) This is a denunciation and a threat, because they used to say to the Messenger, by way of denial, thinking it unlikely ever to happen:\nائْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ اللَّهِ\n(Bring Allah's torment upon us) (29:29). This is as Allah said:\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ\n(And they ask you to hasten on the torment...) (29:53-55). Then Allah says:\nأَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ - مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ\n(Think, if We do let them enjoy for years, and afterwards comes to them that which they had been promised, all that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them.) meaning, `even if We delay the matter and give them respite for a short while or for a long time, then the punishment of Allah comes upon them, what good will their life of luxury do them then'\nكَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا\n(The Day they see it, (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an afternoon or a morning) (79:46).

Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them. He says:\nوَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ\nذِكْرَى وَمَا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ\n(And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.)

He says:\nوَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ\nذِكْرَى وَمَا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ\n(And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.) This is like the Ayat:\nوَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً\n(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger) (17:15).\nوَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَى حَتَّى يَبْعَثَ فِى أُمِّهَا رَسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا\n(And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat.) until;\nوَأَهْلُهَا ظَـلِمُونَ\n(the people thereof are wrongdoers) (28:59)."

This is as Allah said:\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ\n(And they ask you to hasten on the torment...) (29:53-55).

This supplication had an effect on Fir`awn: he did not believe until he saw the painful torment:\nحَتَّى إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ الْغَرَقُ قَالَ ءَامَنتُ أَنَّهُ لا إِلِـهَ إِلاَّ الَّذِى ءَامَنَتْ بِهِ بَنواْ إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(till when drowning overtook him, he said: \"I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe.\") until:\nوَكُنتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(and you were one of the mischief-makers) (10:90-91). And Allah says:\nفَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ\n(so when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah Alone...\") (40:84-85).\nأَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ\n(Would they then wish for Our torment to be hastened on) This is a denunciation and a threat, because they used to say to the Messenger, by way of denial, thinking it unlikely ever to happen:\nائْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ اللَّهِ\n(Bring Allah's torment upon us) (29:29). This is as Allah said:\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ\n(And they ask you to hasten on the torment...) (29:53-55). Then Allah says:\nأَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ - مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ\n(Think, if We do let them enjoy for years, and afterwards comes to them that which they had been promised, all that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them.) meaning, `even if We delay the matter and give them respite for a short while or for a long time, then the punishment of Allah comes upon them, what good will their life of luxury do them then'\nكَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا\n(The Day they see it, (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an afternoon or a morning) (79:46). And Allah says:\nيَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَن يُعَمَّرَ\n(Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from punishment) (2:96).\nوَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى\n(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down) (92:11) Allah says here:\nمَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ\n(All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them.) According to an authentic Hadith:\n«يُؤْتَى بِالْكَافِرِ فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّارِ غَمْسَةً ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ خَيْرًا قَطُّ؟ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيمًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا وَاللهِ يَا رَبِّ، وَيُؤتَى بِأَشَدِّ النَّاسِ بُؤْسًا كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَيُصْبَغُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ صَبْغَةً، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ::َهلْ رَأَيْتَ بُؤْسًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا وَاللهِ يَا رَب»\n(The disbelievers will be brought and once dipped into the Fire, then it will be said to him: \"Did you ever see anything good Did you ever see anything good\" He will say, \"No, O Lord!\" Then the most miserable person who ever lived on earth will be brought, and he will be put in Paradise for a brief spell, then it will be said to him, \"Did you ever see anything bad\" He will say, \"No, O Lord.\") meaning: as if nothing ever happened. Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them. He says:\nوَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ\nذِكْرَى وَمَا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ\n(And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.) This is like the Ayat:\nوَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً\n(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger) (17:15).\nوَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَى حَتَّى يَبْعَثَ فِى أُمِّهَا رَسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا\n(And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat.) until;\nوَأَهْلُهَا ظَـلِمُونَ\n(the people thereof are wrongdoers) (28:59)."

According to an authentic Hadith:\n«يُؤْتَى بِالْكَافِرِ فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّارِ غَمْسَةً ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ خَيْرًا قَطُّ؟ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيمًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا وَاللهِ يَا رَبِّ، وَيُؤتَى بِأَشَدِّ النَّاسِ بُؤْسًا كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَيُصْبَغُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ صَبْغَةً، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ::َهلْ رَأَيْتَ بُؤْسًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا وَاللهِ يَا رَب»\n(The disbelievers will be brought and once dipped into the Fire, then it will be said to him: \"Did you ever see anything good Did you ever see anything good\" He will say, \"No, O Lord!\" Then the most miserable person who ever lived on earth will be brought, and he will be put in Paradise for a brief spell, then it will be said to him, \"Did you ever see anything bad\" He will say, \"No, O Lord.\") meaning: as if nothing ever happened. Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them. He says:\nوَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ\nذِكْرَى وَمَا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ\n(And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.) This is like the Ayat:\nوَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً\n(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger) (17:15).\nوَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَى حَتَّى يَبْعَثَ فِى أُمِّهَا رَسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا\n(And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat.) until;\nوَأَهْلُهَا ظَـلِمُونَ\n(the people thereof are wrongdoers) (28:59)."

      "text": "Between Musa and Fir`awn\nAllah tells us what He commanded His servant, son of `Imran and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, who spoke with Him, to do, when He called him from the right side of the mountain, and conversed with him, and chose him, sent him, and commanded him to go to Fir`awn and his people. Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

      "text": "The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred\nHere Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them. Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:\nفَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:\nلِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),\nلِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا\n(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),\nوَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُواْ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ\n(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),\nلِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),\nلاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,\n«يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»\n(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this\" Then Allah revealed:\nتَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ\n(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said:\n«يَا فَاطِمَةُ ابْنَةُ مُحَمَّدٍ، يَا صَفِيَّةُ ابْنَةُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا سَلُونِي مِنْ مَالِي مَا شِئْتُم»\n(O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:\nوَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ\n(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) means, \"To pray.\" `Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ\n(Who sees you) \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ\n(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ-\n(Who sees you when you stand up. And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) \"When you pray, He sees you when you pray alone and when you pray in congregation.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.\nإِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) He hears all that His servants say and He knows all their movements, as He says:\nوَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ\n(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it) (10:61)."

Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:\nفَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:\nلِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),\nلِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا\n(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),\nوَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُواْ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ\n(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),\nلِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),\nلاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,\n«يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»\n(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this\" Then Allah revealed:\nتَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ\n(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said:\n«يَا فَاطِمَةُ ابْنَةُ مُحَمَّدٍ، يَا صَفِيَّةُ ابْنَةُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا سَلُونِي مِنْ مَالِي مَا شِئْتُم»\n(O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:\nوَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ\n(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) means, \"To pray.\" `Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ\n(Who sees you) \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ\n(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ-\n(Who sees you when you stand up. And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) \"When you pray, He sees you when you pray alone and when you pray in congregation.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.\nإِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) He hears all that His servants say and He knows all their movements, as He says:\nوَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ\n(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it) (10:61)."

Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:\nفَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:\nلِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),\nلِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا\n(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),\nوَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُواْ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ\n(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),\nلِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),\nلاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,\n«يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»\n(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this\" Then Allah revealed:\nتَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ\n(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said:\n«يَا فَاطِمَةُ ابْنَةُ مُحَمَّدٍ، يَا صَفِيَّةُ ابْنَةُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا سَلُونِي مِنْ مَالِي مَا شِئْتُم»\n(O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:\nوَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ\n(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) means, \"To pray.\" `Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ\n(Who sees you) \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ\n(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ-\n(Who sees you when you stand up. And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) \"When you pray, He sees you when you pray alone and when you pray in congregation.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.\nإِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) He hears all that His servants say and He knows all their movements, as He says:\nوَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ\n(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it) (10:61)."

Allah says:\nوَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:\nقَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى\n(Musa said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me.\") (20:25-26) until:\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.) because he had killed that Egyptian, which was the reason that he left the land of Egypt.\nقَالَ كَلاَّ\n((Allah) said: \"Nay!...\") Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),\nفَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ\n(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى\n(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'\nفَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,\nإِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ\n(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'\nأَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:\nأَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً\n(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:\nوَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ\n(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً\n((Musa) said: \"I did it then...\") meaning, at that time,\nوَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ\n(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'\nفَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:\nوَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'"

      "text": "The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred\nHere Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them. Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:\nفَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:\nلِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ\n(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),\nلِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا\n(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),\nوَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُواْ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ\n(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),\nلِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً\n(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),\nلاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,\n«يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»\n(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this\" Then Allah revealed:\nتَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ\n(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said:\n«يَا فَاطِمَةُ ابْنَةُ مُحَمَّدٍ، يَا صَفِيَّةُ ابْنَةُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا سَلُونِي مِنْ مَالِي مَا شِئْتُم»\n(O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: \"When the Ayah:\nوَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ\n(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:\n«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاه»\n(O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:\nوَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ\n(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) means, \"To pray.\" `Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ\n(Who sees you) \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ\n(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) Qatadah said:\nالَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\nوَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ-\n(Who sees you when you stand up. And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) \"When you pray, He sees you when you pray alone and when you pray in congregation.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.\nإِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) He hears all that His servants say and He knows all their movements, as He says:\nوَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ\n(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it) (10:61)."

      "text": "Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators\nHere Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ\n(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.\nأَثِيمٍ\n(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.\nيُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ\n(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:\n«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»\n(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:\n«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»\n(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:\n«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»\n(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»\n(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)\nRefutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ\n(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.\nوَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:\nوَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),\nإِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)\nThe Exception of the Poets of Islam\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً\n(and remember Allah much). He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:\n«اهْجُهُم»\n(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:\n«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»\n(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»\n(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.)

According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others.

      "text": "Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators\nHere Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ\n(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.\nأَثِيمٍ\n(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.\nيُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ\n(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:\n«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»\n(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:\n«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»\n(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:\n«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»\n(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»\n(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)\nRefutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ\n(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.\nوَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:\nوَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),\nإِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)\nThe Exception of the Poets of Islam\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً\n(and remember Allah much). He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:\n«اهْجُهُم»\n(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:\n«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»\n(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»\n(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ\n(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:\n«اهْجُهُم»\n(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:\n«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»\n(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»\n(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ\n(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others. This is the end of the Tafsir Surat Ash-Shu`ara'. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

      "text": "Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators\nHere Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ\n(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.\nأَثِيمٍ\n(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.\nيُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ\n(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:\n«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»\n(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:\n«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»\n(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:\n«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»\n(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»\n(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)\nRefutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ\n(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.\nوَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:\nوَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),\nإِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)\nThe Exception of the Poets of Islam\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً\n(and remember Allah much). He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.)

This is like the Ayah,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ\n(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52).

So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:\n«اهْجُهُم»\n(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:\n«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»\n(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»\n(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ\n(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others. This is the end of the Tafsir Surat Ash-Shu`ara'. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

      "text": "Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators\nHere Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ\n(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,\nهَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ\n(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.\nأَثِيمٍ\n(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.\nيُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ\n(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:\n«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»\n(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:\n«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»\n(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:\n«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»\n(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»\n(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)\nRefutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)\nأَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ\n(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.\nوَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:\nوَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),\nإِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)\nThe Exception of the Poets of Islam\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --\nوَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ\n(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً\n(and remember Allah much). He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds.

He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.)\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:\n«أَنْتُم»\n((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.\nوَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ\n(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:\n«اهْجُهُم»\n(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:\n«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»\n(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»\n(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ\n(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»\n(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others. This is the end of the Tafsir Surat Ash-Shu`ara'. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

Fir`awn did not believe in the Creator in the first place, so he was in no position to ask about the nature of the Creator; he denied that the Creator existed at all, as is apparent from the meaning, even though proof and evidence had been established against him. When Fir`awn asked him about the Lord of Al-`Alamin, Musa said:\nقَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n((Musa) said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them...\") meaning, the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of all that, their God Who has no partner or associate. He is the One Who has created all things. He knows the higher realms and the heavenly bodies that are in them, both those that are stationary and those that move and shine brightly. He knows the lower realms and what is in them; the oceans, continents, mountains, trees, animals, plants and fruits. He knows what is in between the two realms; the winds, birds, and whatever is in the air. All of them are servants to Him, submitting and humbling themselves before Him.\nإِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ\n(if you seek to be convinced with certainty. ) means, if you have believing hearts and clear insight. At this, Fir`awn turned to the chiefs and leaders of his state around him, and said to them -- mockingly expressing his disbelief in Musa:\nأَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ\n(\"Do you not hear\") meaning, `are you not amazed by what this man is claiming -- that you have another god other than me' Musa said to them:\nرَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!) meaning, the One Who created you and your forefathers, those who came before Fir`awn and his time.\nقَالَ\n(He said) that is, Fir`awn said:\nإِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ الَّذِى أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ\n(Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!) meaning, there is no sense in his claim that there is any god other than me!'\nقَالَ\n((Musa) said) -- to those in whose hearts Fir`awn had planted doubts:\nرَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ\n(Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!) `He is the One Who made the east the place where the heavenly bodies rise, and made the west the place where they set; this is the system to which He has subjugated all the heavenly bodies, stationary and moving. If what Fir`awn claims is true, that he is your lord and your god, then let him turn things around so that the heavenly bodies set in the east and rise in the west.' This is similar to the Ayah,\nالَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ\n(who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom When Ibrahim said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim said, \"Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east.

When Fir`awn asked him about the Lord of Al-`Alamin, Musa said:\nقَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ\n((Musa) said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them...\") meaning, the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of all that, their God Who has no partner or associate. He is the One Who has created all things. He knows the higher realms and the heavenly bodies that are in them, both those that are stationary and those that move and shine brightly. He knows the lower realms and what is in them; the oceans, continents, mountains, trees, animals, plants and fruits. He knows what is in between the two realms; the winds, birds, and whatever is in the air. All of them are servants to Him, submitting and humbling themselves before Him.\nإِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ\n(if you seek to be convinced with certainty. ) means, if you have believing hearts and clear insight. At this, Fir`awn turned to the chiefs and leaders of his state around him, and said to them -- mockingly expressing his disbelief in Musa:\nأَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ\n(\"Do you not hear\") meaning, `are you not amazed by what this man is claiming -- that you have another god other than me' Musa said to them:\nرَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!) meaning, the One Who created you and your forefathers, those who came before Fir`awn and his time.\nقَالَ\n(He said) that is, Fir`awn said:\nإِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ الَّذِى أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ\n(Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!) meaning, there is no sense in his claim that there is any god other than me!'\nقَالَ\n((Musa) said) -- to those in whose hearts Fir`awn had planted doubts:\nرَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ\n(Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!) `He is the One Who made the east the place where the heavenly bodies rise, and made the west the place where they set; this is the system to which He has subjugated all the heavenly bodies, stationary and moving. If what Fir`awn claims is true, that he is your lord and your god, then let him turn things around so that the heavenly bodies set in the east and rise in the west.' This is similar to the Ayah,\nالَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ\n(who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom When Ibrahim said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim said, \"Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east. So cause it to rise from the west.\") (2:258) So when Fir`awn was defeated in debate, he resorted to the use of his force and power, believing that this would be effective in dealing with Musa, peace be upon him, so he said, as Allah tells us:"

      "text": "Allah tells us about the disbelief, rebellion, oppression and denial of Fir`awn, as He says:\nوَمَا رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n((Fir`awn said:) \"And what is the Lord of the `Alamin\") This is because he used to say to his people:\nمَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى\n(I know not that you have a god other than me.) (28:28)\nفَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ\n(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) (43:54) They used to deny the Creator, may He be glorified, and they believed that they had no other lord than Fir`awn. When Musa said to them: \"I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds,\" Fir`awn said to him, \"Who is this who you are claiming is the Lord of Al-`Alamin other than me\" This is how it was interpreted by the scholars of the Salaf and the Imams of later generations. As-Suddi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah,\nقَالَ فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يمُوسَى - قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى\n((Fir`awn) said: \"Who then, O Musa, is the Lord of you two\" He said: \"Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.\") (20:49-50) Those among the philosophers and others who claimed that this was a question about the nature or substance of Allah are mistaken.

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an and the Disbelievers turning away;\nThey could be compelled to believe if Allah so willed At the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

This is the issue of disbelief and faith; they never confront one another but faith always prevails:\nبَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ\n(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears. And woe to you for that which you ascribe.) (21:18)\nوَقُلْ جَآءَ الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَـطِلُ\n(And say: \"Truth has come and falsehood has vanished.\") (17:81) The sorcerers of Egypt were the most skilled in the art of illusion, but when a huge group of them gathered from all corners of the land, and the people came together on that day whose exact numbers are known to Allah Alone, one of them said:\nلَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ السَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الْغَـلِبِينَ\n(That we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners.) They did not say: `we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ\n(So, when the sorcerers arrived,) means, when they reached the court of Fir`awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir`awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ\n(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:\nقَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ\n(They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\") (20:65-66). Here the incident is described more briefly. Musa said to them:\nأَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَفَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَـلَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(\"Throw what you are going to throw!\" So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: `this is by the virtue of So-and-so!' In Surat Al-A`raf Allah mentioned that they:\nسَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic) (7:116). And in Surah Ta Ha He said:\nفَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى\n(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) until Allah saying:\nوَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى\n(and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount (of skill) he may attain) (20:69). And here Allah says:\nفَأَلْقَى مُوسَى عَصَـهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ\n(Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!) by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:\nفَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.) until\nرَبِّ مُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ\n(The Lord of Musa and Harun.) (7:118-122) This was a very serious matter, furnishing decisive proof leaving no room for any excuse. Fir`awn's supporters, who sought and hoped that they would prevail over Musa, were themselves defeated. At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:\nإِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ\n(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ\n(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123)."

At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:\nإِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ\n(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ\n(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123)."

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an and the Disbelievers turning away;\nThey could be compelled to believe if Allah so willed At the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

This is the issue of disbelief and faith; they never confront one another but faith always prevails:\nبَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ\n(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears.

They did not say: `we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ\n(So, when the sorcerers arrived,) means, when they reached the court of Fir`awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir`awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ\n(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:\nقَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ\n(They said: \"O Musa!

Musa said to them:\nأَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَفَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَـلَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(\"Throw what you are going to throw!\" So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: `this is by the virtue of So-and-so!' In Surat Al-A`raf Allah mentioned that they:\nسَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic) (7:116). And in Surah Ta Ha He said:\nفَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى\n(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) until Allah saying:\nوَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى\n(and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount (of skill) he may attain) (20:69). And here Allah says:\nفَأَلْقَى مُوسَى عَصَـهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ\n(Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!) by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:\nفَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.) until\nرَبِّ مُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ\n(The Lord of Musa and Harun.)

They did not say: `we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ\n(So, when the sorcerers arrived,) means, when they reached the court of Fir`awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir`awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ\n(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:\nقَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ\n(They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\") (20:65-66). Here the incident is described more briefly. Musa said to them:\nأَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَفَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَـلَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(\"Throw what you are going to throw!\" So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: `this is by the virtue of So-and-so!' In Surat Al-A`raf Allah mentioned that they:\nسَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic) (7:116). And in Surah Ta Ha He said:\nفَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى\n(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) until Allah saying:\nوَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى\n(and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount (of skill) he may attain) (20:69). And here Allah says:\nفَأَلْقَى مُوسَى عَصَـهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ\n(Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!) by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:\nفَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.) until\nرَبِّ مُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ\n(The Lord of Musa and Harun.) (7:118-122) This was a very serious matter, furnishing decisive proof leaving no room for any excuse. Fir`awn's supporters, who sought and hoped that they would prevail over Musa, were themselves defeated. At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:\nإِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ\n(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ\n(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123)."

And in Surah Ta Ha He said:\nفَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى\n(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) until Allah saying:\nوَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى\n(and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount (of skill) he may attain) (20:69). And here Allah says:\nفَأَلْقَى مُوسَى عَصَـهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ\n(Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!) by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:\nفَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.) until\nرَبِّ مُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ\n(The Lord of Musa and Harun.) (7:118-122) This was a very serious matter, furnishing decisive proof leaving no room for any excuse. Fir`awn's supporters, who sought and hoped that they would prevail over Musa, were themselves defeated. At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:\nإِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ\n(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).\nإِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ\n(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123)."

      "text": "Between Musa, peace be upon him, and the Sorcerers Allah describes the actual encounter between Musa, peace be upon him,and the Egyptians in Surat Al-A` raf, Surah Ta Ha, and in this Surah\nThe Egyptians wanted to extinguish the Light of Allah with their words, but Allah insisted that His Light should prevail even though the disbelievers disliked that. This is the issue of disbelief and faith; they never confront one another but faith always prevails:\nبَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ\n(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears. And woe to you for that which you ascribe.) (21:18)\nوَقُلْ جَآءَ الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَـطِلُ\n(And say: \"Truth has come and falsehood has vanished.\") (17:81) The sorcerers of Egypt were the most skilled in the art of illusion, but when a huge group of them gathered from all corners of the land, and the people came together on that day whose exact numbers are known to Allah Alone, one of them said:\nلَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ السَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الْغَـلِبِينَ\n(That we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners.) They did not say: `we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ\n(So, when the sorcerers arrived,) means, when they reached the court of Fir`awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir`awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:\nفَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ\n(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:\nقَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ\n(They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\") (20:65-66). Here the incident is described more briefly. Musa said to them:\nأَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَفَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَـلَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(\"Throw what you are going to throw!\" So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: `this is by the virtue of So-and-so!'

Then Fir`awn said to them:\nءَامَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ\n(You have believed in him before I give you leave.) meaning, `you should have asked my permission for what you did, and you did not consult with me; if I had given you permission you could have done it, and if I did not allow you, you should not have done it, for I am the ruler and the one to be obeyed.'\nإِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ\n(Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic!)

Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

      "text": "The Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt\nAfter Musa stayed in Egypt for a long time, and the proof of Allah was established against Fir`awn and his chiefs, yet they were still arrogant and stubborn, then there was nothing left for them but punishment and vengeance. So Allah commanded Musa, peace be upon him, to take the Children of Israel out of Egypt by night, and take them wherever he would be commanded. So Musa, peace be upon him, did as he was commanded by his Lord, may He be glorified, and he led them forth after they had borrowed an abundance of jewelry from the people of Fir`awn. As more than one of the scholars of Tafsir have said, they left when the moon was rising, and Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said that the moon was eclipsed that night. And Allah knows best. Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf (Prophet Joseph), peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them. The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir`awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed. So he quickly sent his callers to all his cities, i.e., to mobilize his troops and bring them together, and he called out to them:\nإِنَّ هَـؤُلآءِ\n(Verily, these) meaning, the Children of Israel,\nلَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ\n(indeed are but a small band. ) meaning, a small group.\nوَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ\n(And verily, they have done what has enraged us.) means, `every time we have heard anything about them, it has upset us and made us angry.'\nوَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَـذِرُونَ\n(But we are a host all assembled, amply forewarned.) means, `we are constantly taking precautions lest they betray us.' Some of the Salaf read this with the meaning, \"we are constantly forewarned and forearmed. And I want to destroy them to the last man, and destroy all their lands and property.\" So he and his troops were punished with the very things he sought to inflict upon the Children of Israel. Allah says:\nفَأَخْرَجْنَـهُمْ مِّن جَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ\n(So, We expelled them from gardens and springs, treasures, and every kind of honorable place.) meaning, they were thrown out of those blessings and into Hell, and they left behind the honorable places, gardens and rivers, wealth, provision, position and power in this world:\nكَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَـهَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.) This is like the Ayat:\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed) (7: 137).\nوَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ\n(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land, and to make them rulers and to make them the inheritors) The two Ayat thereafter: 28:5-6."

Allah says:\nفَأَخْرَجْنَـهُمْ مِّن جَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ\n(So, We expelled them from gardens and springs, treasures, and every kind of honorable place.) meaning, they were thrown out of those blessings and into Hell, and they left behind the honorable places, gardens and rivers, wealth, provision, position and power in this world:\nكَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَـهَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ\n(Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.) This is like the Ayat:\nوَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَـرِقَ الاٌّرْضِ وَمَغَـرِبَهَا الَّتِى بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا\n(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed) (7: 137).\nوَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ\n(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land, and to make them rulers and to make them the inheritors) The two Ayat thereafter: 28:5-6."

Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

      "text": "Fir`awn's Pursuit and Expulsion of the Children of Israel, and how He and His People were drowned\nMore than one of the scholars of Tafsir said that Fir`awn set out with a huge group, a group containing the leaders and entire government of Egypt at that time, i.e., the decision-makers and influential figures, princes, ministers, nobles, leaders and soldiers.\nفَأَتْبَعُوهُم مُّشْرِقِينَ\n(So, they pursued them at sunrise.) means, they caught up with the Children of Israel at sunrise.\nفَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ\n(And when the two hosts saw each other,) means, each group saw the other. At that point,\nقَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ\n(the companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\") This was because Fir`awn and his people caught up with them on the shores of the Red Sea, so the sea was ahead of them and Fir`awn and his troops were behind them. Hence they said:\nفَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ - قَالَ كَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ\n(\"We are sure to be overtaken.\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, verily with me is my Lord. He will guide me.\") meaning, `nothing of what you fear will happen to you, for Allah is the One Who commanded me to bring you here, and He does not go back on His promise.' Harun, peace be upon him, was in the front, with Yusha` bin Nun and a believer from the family of Fir`awn, and Musa, peace be upon him, was in the rear. More than one of the scholars of Tafsir said that they stood there not knowing what to do, and Yusha` bin Nun or the believer from the family of Fir`awn said to Musa, peace be upon him, \"O Prophet of Allah, is it here that your Lord commanded you to bring us\" He said: \"Yes.\" Then Fir`awn and his troops drew near and were very close indeed. At that point Allah commanded his Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, to strike the sea with his staff, so he struck it, and it parted, by the will of Allah. Allah says:\nفَانفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَالطَّوْدِ الْعَظِيمِ\n(And it parted, and each separate part became like huge mountain.) meaning, like mighty mountains. This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others. `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It refers to a pass between two mountains.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"The sea divided into twelve paths, one for each of the tribes.\" As-Suddi added, \"And in it there were windows through which they could see one another, and the water was erected like walls.\" Allah sent the wind to the sea bed to make it solid like the land. Allah says:\nفَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً وَلاَ تَخْشَى\n(and strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken nor being afraid) (20:77). And here He says:\nوَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الاٌّخَرِينَ\n(Then We brought near the others to that place.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi said:\nوَأَزْلَفْنَا\n(Then We brought near) means, \"We brought Fir`awn and his troops near to the sea.\"\nوَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَى وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ - ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا الاٌّخَرِينَ\n(And We saved Musa and all those with him. Then We drowned the others.) meaning: `We saved Musa and the Children of Israel and whoever followed their religion, and none of them were destroyed, but Fir`awn and his troops were drowned and not one of them remained alive, but was destroyed.' Then Allah says:\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is indeed a sign,) meaning, this story with its wonders and tales of aid to the believing servants of Allah is definitive proof and evidence of Allah's wisdom.\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(yet most of them are not believers.

Hence they said:\nفَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ - قَالَ كَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ\n(\"We are sure to be overtaken.\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, verily with me is my Lord. He will guide me.\") meaning, `nothing of what you fear will happen to you, for Allah is the One Who commanded me to bring you here, and He does not go back on His promise.' Harun, peace be upon him, was in the front, with Yusha` bin Nun and a believer from the family of Fir`awn, and Musa, peace be upon him, was in the rear. More than one of the scholars of Tafsir said that they stood there not knowing what to do, and Yusha` bin Nun or the believer from the family of Fir`awn said to Musa, peace be upon him, \"O Prophet of Allah, is it here that your Lord commanded you to bring us\" He said: \"Yes.\" Then Fir`awn and his troops drew near and were very close indeed. At that point Allah commanded his Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, to strike the sea with his staff, so he struck it, and it parted, by the will of Allah. Allah says:\nفَانفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَالطَّوْدِ الْعَظِيمِ\n(And it parted, and each separate part became like huge mountain.) meaning, like mighty mountains. This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others. `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It refers to a pass between two mountains.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"The sea divided into twelve paths, one for each of the tribes.\" As-Suddi added, \"And in it there were windows through which they could see one another, and the water was erected like walls.\" Allah sent the wind to the sea bed to make it solid like the land.

Ibn `Abbas, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi said:\nوَأَزْلَفْنَا\n(Then We brought near) means, \"We brought Fir`awn and his troops near to the sea.\"\nوَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَى وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ - ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا الاٌّخَرِينَ\n(And We saved Musa and all those with him.

Then Allah says:\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is indeed a sign,) meaning, this story with its wonders and tales of aid to the believing servants of Allah is definitive proof and evidence of Allah's wisdom.\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(yet most of them are not believers.

      "text": "How the Close Friend of Allah, Ibrahim spoke out against Shirk\nHere Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and Close Friend, Ibrahim, upon him be peace, the leader of the pure monotheists. Allah commanded His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ to recite this story to his Ummah so that they could follow this example of sincerity towards Allah, putting one's trust in Him, worshipping Him Alone with no partner or associate, and renouncing Shirk and its people. Allah granted guidance to Ibrahim before, i.e., from a very early age he had denounced his people's practice of worshipping idols with Allah, may He be exalted.\nإِذْ قَالَ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ\n(When he said to his father and his people: \"What do you worship\") meaning: what are these statues to which you are so devoted\nقَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ أَصْنَاماً فَنَظَلُّ لَهَا عَـكِفِينَ\n(They said: \"We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted.\") meaning: we are devoted to worshipping them and praying to them.\nقَالَ هَلْ يَسْمَعُونَكُمْ إِذْ تَدْعُونَ - أَوْ يَنفَعُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَضُرُّونَ - قَالُواْ بَلْ وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا كَذَلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ\n(He said: \"Do they hear you when you call Or do they benefit you or do they cause harm\" They said: \"(Nay) but we found our fathers doing so.\") They knew that their idols could not do anything, but they had seen their fathers doing this, so they made haste to follow in their footsteps. So Ibrahim said to them:\nقَالَ أَفَرَءَيْتُمْ مَّا كُنْتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ - أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ الاٌّقْدَمُونَ - فَإِنَّهُمْ عَدُوٌّ لِى إِلاَّ رَبَّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(Do you observe that which you have been worshipping --you and your ancient fathers Verily, they are enemies to me, save the Lord of Al-`Alamin.) meaning, `if these idols mean anything and have any influence, then let them do me any kind of harm, for I am an enemy to them and I do not care about them or think anything of them.' This is akin to the way Allah described Nuh:\nفَأَجْمِعُواْ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَكُمْ\n(So devise your plot, you and your partners) (10:71). And Hud, upon him be peace, said:\nإِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّى أُشْهِدُ اللَّهِ وَاشْهَدُواْ أَنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ - مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لاَ تُنظِرُونِ - إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ ءاخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَآ إِنَّ رَبِّى عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ\n(\"I call Allah to witness and bear you witness that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship. So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He has the grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path) (11:54-56). rSimilarly, Ibrahim denounced their gods and idols and said:\nوَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَآ أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلاَ تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِاللَّهِ\n(And how should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah, while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah) (6:81). And Allah said:\nقَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ\n(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim) until His saying;\nحَتَّى تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ\n(until you believe in Allah Alone) (60:4).\nوَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ - وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ\n(And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father and his people: \"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring, that they may turn back) (43:26-28). meaning: \"La Ilaha Illallah.\""

Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and no one besides Him is able to do that, for He is the One Who originates and repeats.\nوَالَّذِى أَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لِى خَطِيئَتِى يَوْمَ الدِّينِ\n(And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Recompense.) means, no one is able to forgive sins in this world or the Hereafter except Him. Who can forgive sins except Allah For He is the One Who does whatever He wills."

Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is knowledge.\"\nوَأَلْحِقْنِى بِالصَّـلِحِينَ\n(and join me with the righteous.) means, `make me one of the righteous in this world and the Hereafter.' This is like the words the Prophet said three times when he was dying:\n«اللَّهُمَّ فِي الرَّفِيقِ الْأَعْلَى»\n(O Allah, with the Exalted Companion (of Paradise)).\nوَاجْعَل لِّى لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ فِى الاٌّخِرِينَ\n(And grant me an honorable mention in later generations.) meaning, `cause me to be remembered in a good manner after my death, so that I will be spoken of and taken as a good example.' This is like the Ayah,\nوَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الاٌّخِرِينَ سَلَـمٌ عَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations: \"Salam (peace) be upon Ibrahim.

Forgive me, and my parents) (71:28). But this is something which Ibrahim, peace be upon him, later stopped doing, as Allah says:\nوَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ\n(And Ibrahim's supplication for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him) (9:114) until:\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing) (9:114). Allah stopped Ibrahim from asking for forgiveness for his father, as He says:\nقَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ\n(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him), until His saying:\nوَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ\n(but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah. ) (60:4),\nوَلاَ تُخْزِنِى يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(And disgrace me not on the Day when they will be resurrected.) means, `protect me from shame on the Day of Resurrection and the Day when all creatures, the first and the last, will be raised.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَأَى أَبَاهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَيْهِ الْغَبَرَةُ وَالْقَتَرَة»\n(Ibrahim will see his father on the Day of Resurrection, covered with dust and darkness.) According to another narration, also from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet said:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنَّكَ لَا تُخْزِينِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرين»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father and will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when all creatures are resurrected.\" And Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\") He also recorded this in the Hadiths about the Prophets, upon them be peace, where the wording is:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ آزَرَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَعَلَى وَجْهِ آزَرَ قَتَرَةٌ وَغَبَرَةٌ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكَ لَا تَعْصِينِي، فَيَقُولُ أَبُوهُ: فَالْيَوْمَ لَا أَعْصِيكَ، فَيَقُولُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنْ لَا تُخْزِيَنِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَأَيُّ خِزْيٍ أَخْزَى مِنْ أَبِي الْأَبْعَدِ فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ انْظُرْ تَحْتَ رِجْلِكَ، فَيَنْظُرَ،فَإِذَا هُوَ بِذِيخٍ مُتَلَطِّخٍ، فَيُؤْخَذُ بِقَوَائِمِهِ فَيُلْقَى فِي النَّار»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and there will be dust and darkness on Azar's face. Ibrahim will say to him, \"Did I not tell you not to disobey me\" His father will say to him: \"Today I will not disobey you.\" Ibrahim will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state\" Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\" Then it will be said: \"O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.\" So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.) This was also recorded by Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i in the Tafsir of his Sunan Al-Kubra.\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,) means, a man's wealth will not protect him from the punishment of Allah, even if he were to pay a ransom equivalent to an earthful of gold.\nوَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(nor sons) means, `or if you were to pay a ransom of all the people on earth.' On that Day nothing will be of any avail except faith in Allah and sincere devotion to Him, and renunciation of Shirk and its people. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ\n(Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart. ) meaning, free from any impurity or Shirk. Ibn Sirin said, \"The clean heart knows that Allah is true, that the Hour will undoubtedly come and that Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.\" Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, \"The clean heart is the sound heart.\" This is the heart of the believer, for the heart of the disbeliever and the hypocrite is sick. Allah says:\nفِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ\n(In their hearts is a disease) (2:10). Abu `Uthman An-Nisaburi said, \"It is the heart that is free from innovation and is content with the Sunnah.\""

(37:108-110)\nوَاجْعَلْنِى مِن وَرَثَةِ جَنَّةِ النَّعِيمِ\n(And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.) meaning, `bless me in this world with honorable mention after I am gone, and in the Hereafter by making me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.'\nوَاغْفِرْ لاًّبِى\n(And forgive my father,) This is like the Ayah,\nرَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَالِدَىَّ\n(My Lord!

But this is something which Ibrahim, peace be upon him, later stopped doing, as Allah says:\nوَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ\n(And Ibrahim's supplication for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him) (9:114) until:\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing) (9:114). Allah stopped Ibrahim from asking for forgiveness for his father, as He says:\nقَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ\n(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him), until His saying:\nوَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ\n(but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah. ) (60:4),\nوَلاَ تُخْزِنِى يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(And disgrace me not on the Day when they will be resurrected.) means, `protect me from shame on the Day of Resurrection and the Day when all creatures, the first and the last, will be raised.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَأَى أَبَاهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَيْهِ الْغَبَرَةُ وَالْقَتَرَة»\n(Ibrahim will see his father on the Day of Resurrection, covered with dust and darkness.) According to another narration, also from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet said:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنَّكَ لَا تُخْزِينِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرين»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father and will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when all creatures are resurrected.\" And Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\") He also recorded this in the Hadiths about the Prophets, upon them be peace, where the wording is:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ آزَرَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَعَلَى وَجْهِ آزَرَ قَتَرَةٌ وَغَبَرَةٌ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكَ لَا تَعْصِينِي، فَيَقُولُ أَبُوهُ: فَالْيَوْمَ لَا أَعْصِيكَ، فَيَقُولُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنْ لَا تُخْزِيَنِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَأَيُّ خِزْيٍ أَخْزَى مِنْ أَبِي الْأَبْعَدِ فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ انْظُرْ تَحْتَ رِجْلِكَ، فَيَنْظُرَ،فَإِذَا هُوَ بِذِيخٍ مُتَلَطِّخٍ، فَيُؤْخَذُ بِقَوَائِمِهِ فَيُلْقَى فِي النَّار»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and there will be dust and darkness on Azar's face. Ibrahim will say to him, \"Did I not tell you not to disobey me\" His father will say to him: \"Today I will not disobey you.\" Ibrahim will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state\" Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\" Then it will be said: \"O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.\" So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.) This was also recorded by Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i in the Tafsir of his Sunan Al-Kubra.\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,) means, a man's wealth will not protect him from the punishment of Allah, even if he were to pay a ransom equivalent to an earthful of gold.\nوَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(nor sons) means, `or if you were to pay a ransom of all the people on earth.' On that Day nothing will be of any avail except faith in Allah and sincere devotion to Him, and renunciation of Shirk and its people. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ\n(Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart. ) meaning, free from any impurity or Shirk. Ibn Sirin said, \"The clean heart knows that Allah is true, that the Hour will undoubtedly come and that Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.\" Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, \"The clean heart is the sound heart.\" This is the heart of the believer, for the heart of the disbeliever and the hypocrite is sick. Allah says:\nفِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ\n(In their hearts is a disease) (2:10). Abu `Uthman An-Nisaburi said, \"It is the heart that is free from innovation and is content with the Sunnah.\""

Ibrahim will say to him, \"Did I not tell you not to disobey me\" His father will say to him: \"Today I will not disobey you.\" Ibrahim will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state\" Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\" Then it will be said: \"O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.\" So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.) This was also recorded by Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i in the Tafsir of his Sunan Al-Kubra.\nيَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,) means, a man's wealth will not protect him from the punishment of Allah, even if he were to pay a ransom equivalent to an earthful of gold.\nوَلاَ بَنُونَ\n(nor sons) means, `or if you were to pay a ransom of all the people on earth.' On that Day nothing will be of any avail except faith in Allah and sincere devotion to Him, and renunciation of Shirk and its people. Allah says:\nإِلاَّ مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ\n(Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart. ) meaning, free from any impurity or Shirk. Ibn Sirin said, \"The clean heart knows that Allah is true, that the Hour will undoubtedly come and that Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.\" Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, \"The clean heart is the sound heart.\" This is the heart of the believer, for the heart of the disbeliever and the hypocrite is sick. Allah says:\nفِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ\n(In their hearts is a disease) (2:10). Abu `Uthman An-Nisaburi said, \"It is the heart that is free from innovation and is content with the Sunnah.\""

      "text": "The Prayer of Ibrahim for Himself and for His Father\nHere Ibrahim, upon him be peace, asks his Lord to give him Hukm. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is knowledge.\"\nوَأَلْحِقْنِى بِالصَّـلِحِينَ\n(and join me with the righteous.) means, `make me one of the righteous in this world and the Hereafter.' This is like the words the Prophet said three times when he was dying:\n«اللَّهُمَّ فِي الرَّفِيقِ الْأَعْلَى»\n(O Allah, with the Exalted Companion (of Paradise)).\nوَاجْعَل لِّى لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ فِى الاٌّخِرِينَ\n(And grant me an honorable mention in later generations.) meaning, `cause me to be remembered in a good manner after my death, so that I will be spoken of and taken as a good example.' This is like the Ayah,\nوَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الاٌّخِرِينَ سَلَـمٌ عَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ\n(And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations: \"Salam (peace) be upon Ibrahim. Thus indeed do we reward the good doers.) (37:108-110)\nوَاجْعَلْنِى مِن وَرَثَةِ جَنَّةِ النَّعِيمِ\n(And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.) meaning, `bless me in this world with honorable mention after I am gone, and in the Hereafter by making me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.'\nوَاغْفِرْ لاًّبِى\n(And forgive my father,) This is like the Ayah,\nرَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَالِدَىَّ\n(My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents) (71:28). But this is something which Ibrahim, peace be upon him, later stopped doing, as Allah says:\nوَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ\n(And Ibrahim's supplication for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him) (9:114) until:\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing) (9:114). Allah stopped Ibrahim from asking for forgiveness for his father, as He says:\nقَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ\n(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him), until His saying:\nوَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ\n(but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah. ) (60:4),\nوَلاَ تُخْزِنِى يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ\n(And disgrace me not on the Day when they will be resurrected.) means, `protect me from shame on the Day of Resurrection and the Day when all creatures, the first and the last, will be raised.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَأَى أَبَاهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَيْهِ الْغَبَرَةُ وَالْقَتَرَة»\n(Ibrahim will see his father on the Day of Resurrection, covered with dust and darkness.) According to another narration, also from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet said:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنَّكَ لَا تُخْزِينِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرين»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father and will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when all creatures are resurrected.\" And Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\") He also recorded this in the Hadiths about the Prophets, upon them be peace, where the wording is:\n«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ آزَرَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَعَلَى وَجْهِ آزَرَ قَتَرَةٌ وَغَبَرَةٌ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكَ لَا تَعْصِينِي، فَيَقُولُ أَبُوهُ: فَالْيَوْمَ لَا أَعْصِيكَ، فَيَقُولُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنْ لَا تُخْزِيَنِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَأَيُّ خِزْيٍ أَخْزَى مِنْ أَبِي الْأَبْعَدِ فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ انْظُرْ تَحْتَ رِجْلِكَ، فَيَنْظُرَ،فَإِذَا هُوَ بِذِيخٍ مُتَلَطِّخٍ، فَيُؤْخَذُ بِقَوَائِمِهِ فَيُلْقَى فِي النَّار»\n(Ibrahim will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and there will be dust and darkness on Azar's face.

      "text": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an and the Disbelievers turning away;\nThey could be compelled to believe if Allah so willed At the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah's saying:\nتِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ\n(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.\nأَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:\nفَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَتٍ\n(So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً\n(Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:\nلَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ\n(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:\nإِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ\n(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\n(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)\nيحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)\nثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ\n(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ\n(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.\nوَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ\n(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً\n(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:\nوَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ\n(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,\nالرَّحِيمِ\n(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: \"He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.\""

Similarly, in this Surah, Allah tells us that they will say:\nفَمَا لَنَا مِن شَـفِعِينَ - وَلاَ صَدِيقٍ حَمِيمٍ\n(Now we have no intercessors, nor a close friend.)\nفَلَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n((Alas!) If we only had a chance to return, we shall truly be among the believers!) They will wish that they could come back to this world so that they could do deeds of obedience to their Lord -- as they claim -- but Allah knows that if they were to come back to this world, they would only go back to doing forbidden things, and He knows that they are liars. Allah tells us in Surah Sad about how the people of Hell will argue with one another, as He says:\nإِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَحَقٌّ تَخَاصُمُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ\n(Verily, that is the very truth -- the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!)

Its people are the pious who preferred it to whatever was in this world, and strove for it in this world.\nوَبُرِّزَتِ الْجَحِيمُ لِلْغَاوِينَ\n(And the (Hell) Fire will be placed in full view of the astray.) meaning, it will be shown to them and a neck will stretch forth from it, moaning and sighing, and their hearts will reach their throats. It will be said to its people by way of reproach and rebuke:\nوَقِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ - مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ هَلْ يَنصُرُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَنتَصِرُونَ\n(Where are those that you used to worship instead of Allah Can they help you or help themselves) meaning, `the gods and idols whom you used to worship instead of Allah cannot help you today, and they cannot even protect themselves. You and they are fuel for Hell today, which you will surely enter.'\nفَكُبْكِبُواْ فِيهَا هُمْ وَالْغَاوُونَ\n(Then they will be thrown on their faces into it (the Fire), they and the astray.) Mujahid said, \"This means, they will be hurled into it.\" Others said: \"They will be thrown on top of one another, the disbelievers and their leaders who called them to Shirk. \"\nوَجُنُودُ إِبْلِيسَ أَجْمَعُونَ\n(And all of the hosts of Iblis together.) they will all be thrown into it.\nقَالُواْ وَهُمْ فِيهَا يَخْتَصِمُونَ - تَاللَّهِ إِن كُنَّا لَفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ - إِذْ نُسَوِّيكُمْ بِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(They will say while contending therein, \"By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error, when we held you as equals with the Lord of all that exists.\") The weak ones among them will say to their arrogant leaders: `Verily, we were following you; can you avail us anything from the Fire' Then they will realize that themselves are to blame and will say: a\nتَاللَّهِ إِن كُنَّا لَفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ - إِذْ نُسَوِّيكُمْ بِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error, when we held you as equals with the Lord of all that exists.) meaning, `we obeyed your commands as we should have obeyed the commands of the Lord of the all that exits, and we worshipped you along with the Lord of all that exits.'\nوَمَآ أَضَلَّنَآ إِلاَّ الْمُجْرِمُونَ\n(And none has brought us into error except the criminals.) meaning, `nobody called us to do that except the evildoers.'\nفَمَا لَنَا مِن شَـفِعِينَ\n(Now we have no intercessors.) This is like the Ayah which tells us that they will say:\nفَهَل لَّنَا مِن شُفَعَآءَ فَيَشْفَعُواْ لَنَآ أَوْ نُرَدُّ فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ\n(...now are there any intercessors for us that they might intercede on our behalf Or could we be sent back so that we might do deeds other than those deeds which we used to do) (7:53). Similarly, in this Surah, Allah tells us that they will say:\nفَمَا لَنَا مِن شَـفِعِينَ - وَلاَ صَدِيقٍ حَمِيمٍ\n(Now we have no intercessors, nor a close friend.)\nفَلَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n((Alas!) If we only had a chance to return, we shall truly be among the believers!) They will wish that they could come back to this world so that they could do deeds of obedience to their Lord -- as they claim -- but Allah knows that if they were to come back to this world, they would only go back to doing forbidden things, and He knows that they are liars. Allah tells us in Surah Sad about how the people of Hell will argue with one another, as He says:\nإِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَحَقٌّ تَخَاصُمُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ\n(Verily, that is the very truth -- the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!) (38:64) Then He says:\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ\n(Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.) meaning, in the dispute of Ibrahim with his people and his proof of Tawhid there is a sign, i.e., clear evidence that there is no God but Allah.\nإِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ\n(yet most of them are not believers.
