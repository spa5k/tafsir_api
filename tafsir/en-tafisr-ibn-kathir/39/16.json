  "text": "Creating Fear of the Punishment of Allah\nAllah `says, say O Muhammad, even though you are the Messenger of Allah ﷺ:'\nإِنِّى أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّى عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ\n(Verily, if I disobey my Lord, I am afraid of the torment of a great Day.) meaning the Day of Resurrection. This is a conditional sentence, and if what is referred to here applies to the Prophet , it applies even more so to others,\nقُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ دِينِى فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ\n(Say: \"Allah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only. So, worship what you like besides Him.\") This is also a threat, and a disowning of them.\nقُلْ إِنَّ الْخَـسِرِينَ\n(Say: \"The losers...\") means, the greatest losers of all,\nالَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ\n(are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.) means, they will be separated and will never meet again, whether their families have gone to Paradise and they have gone to Hell, or all of them have gone to Hell, they will never meet or feel happiness again.\nأَلاَ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ\n(Verily, that will be a manifest loss!) means, this is the clearest and most obvious loss. Then He describes their state in the Fire:\nلَهُمْ مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ مِّنَ النَّارِ وَمِن تَحْتِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ\n(They shall have coverings of Fire, above them and covering (of Fire) beneath them.) This is like the Ayat:\nلَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Theirs will be a bed of Hell (Fire), and over them coverings (of Hell-fire). Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers) (7:41)\nيَوْمَ يَغْشَـهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِمْ وَيِقُولُ ذُوقُواْ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(On the Day when the torment (Hell-fire) shall cover them from above them and from underneath their feet, and it will be said: \"Taste what you used to do.\") (29:55)\nذَلِكَ يُخَوِّفُ اللَّهُ بِهِ عِبَادَهُ\n(With this Allah frightens His servants:) means, Allah tells us about this, which will undoubtedly come to pass, to frighten His servants, so that they will keep away from unlawful things and from sin.\nيعِبَادِ فَاتَّقُونِ\n(O My servants, therefore have Taqwa of Me!) means, `fear My wrath, My anger, My punishment and My vengeance.'",
