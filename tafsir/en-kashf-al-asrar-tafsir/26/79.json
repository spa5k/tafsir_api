They said to him, \ufffdWhy do you not want this and why do you not eat?\ufffdHe answered, \ufffdSurely His are the creation and the command [7:54]. This form of ours is commanded by His creation, and this soul of ours is commanded by His command. We have tied ourselves to His desire and pulled ourselves into the stable of His graciousness so that He will not leave us without nourishment.\ufffdThe compass of Power had not yet turned around the circle of existence when He gave every- one what was suited for him and was done with him. \ufffdGod is finished with creation, character, moment of death, and provision.\ufffdOne person is in bondage to the nourishment of the soul, another hopes for the nourishment of the heart. The nourishment of the soul is food and drink, and the nourishment of the heart is recognition and love. One person lives through the soul-he lives by food and air. Another lives through the Real-he lives by love and remembrance.Whenever this verse was recited Dhu'l-Nūn Miṣrī would say, \ufffdWho gives me to eat of the food of recognition, and gives me to drink of the wine of love.\ufffd Then he would sing,\ufffdThe wine of love is the best wine- every other wine is a mirage.\ufffdAbū Bakr al-Warrāq said, \ufffdWho gives me to eat without food and gives me to drink without drink. Metaphorically, 'He satiates me and quenches me without attachment.' There is evidence for this in the account of the cup-bearer during the era of God's Messenger. For three days the Prophet was heard reciting 'There is no creature crawling on the earth but that its provision rests on God' [11:6]. He had doubts about his proximity. Then someone came to him in a dream with a cup of the wine of the Garden and gave him to drink of it. Anas said, 'After that he lived twenty-some years never eating or drinking because of appetite.'\ufffd"
