He is the Lord whose love is the repose of hearts, whose remembrance is the adornment of the eras, whose words are the banquet of the ears, whose seeing is the celebration of the eyes, whose assurance is the promise of caresses, whose face-to-face vision is the ease of the spirits, whose street is the home of the chevaliers, whose conversation is the goal of the recognizers, and from whose direc- tion blows the breeze of union. All is from Him, all is in Him and indeed, all is He. Say \ufffdGod,\ufffd then leave them [6:91]."
