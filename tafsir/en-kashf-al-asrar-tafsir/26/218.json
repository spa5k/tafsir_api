Were something to be veiled, they would not stay alive.\ufffdO chevaliers! Know that the body lives by serving Him, the heart lives by gazing on Him, and the spirit lives by loving Him. The body that does not live by serving Him is idle, the heart that does not live by gazing on Him is carrion, the spirit that does not live by loving Him is captive to death.My joy from time is encountering You, my abode of peace is Your house.You are the object of my hope as long as I live; my life would not be happy without You.*Who is the heart that it should scatter pearls without You?What is the body that it should run a kingdom without You?By God, intelligence does not know the way without You, the spirit has not the gall to stay without YouWho sees thee when thou standest and when thou movest about among those who prostrate them- selves. With this verse, He severed him from the witnessing of creation, for when someone knows that he is witnessed by the Real, he looks to the details of his own states and his hidden affairs with the Real. The toil of the compact of the acts of worship becomes easy for him because He has re- ported that He sees him. There is no hardship for him who knows he is seen by his Patron. In the report has come, \ufffdWorship God as if you see Him, for even if you do not see Him, He sees you.\ufffd"
