  "text": "Surely they are an enemy to me, save the Lord of the Worlds, who created me, so He is guiding me.The mark of love is that, when the lover comes to the description of the Beloved, he turns his heart away from others. He remembers only the Beloved and speaks only in laudation of the Beloved. He does not become sated by remembering Him, lauding Him, and thanking Him, nor can he re- main silent. This was the case when Abraham began to remember and praise God. Look how he clung to plentiful remembrance and laudation and much supplication and pleading!What a difference between these two groups-the owners of requests and the companions of the realities! The owners of requests strive, bring forth obedience, and count out litanies, and then, after that, they present their requests. Their hearts are attached to the reward, and they implore by supplicating and requesting what they want. A report has come: \ufffdSurely God loves those who implore in their supplications.\ufffd This is the station of the lords of the Shariah. Moses was in this station when he said, \ufffdMy Lord, open my breast and ease my task!\ufffd [20:26] and so on.Above this is the station of the companions of the realities. In remembering and lauding the Beloved they never turn to requesting what they want. Sometimes their tongues cling to lauda- tion and sometimes their hearts are mixed with contemplation, their secret cores having reached union. Annihilated from themselves, they subsist through the Real. This was the state of Abraham when he said, \ufffdwho created me, so He is guiding me.\ufffd In other words: \ufffdHe is guiding me from me to Him, for my existence has been effaced, and none but the Object of my worship guides me in myself.\ufffdThis is why the Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, show me the road to Yourself and release me from the bonds of myself. O He who makes arrive, make me arrive at Yourself, for no one arrives by himself!\ufffdO God, remembering You is delight, loving You celebration, recognizing You the kingdom, finding You joy, companionship with You the spirit's repose, proximity to You light. Your seeker is slain though alive, and finding You is the resurrection without Trumpet.\ufffd"
