The servant was in the conceal- ment of nonexistence and He chose him over the whole world.Part of His mercy is that He gives the servant the success to be on guard against the hidden sorts of associationism and the subtle sorts of eye-service. He said, \ufffdI am clement and ever- merciful\ufffd so that the disobedient would not despair and would have a strong hope in His bounty and generosity.YaḤyā ibn Muʿādh Rāzī said, \ufffdYou were gentle to Your friends, so they recognized You.Had you been gentle to Your enemies, they would not have refused You.\ufffd You made the jasmine of Your gentleness grow in the garden of the hearts of Your friends such that, by means of Your gentleness and bounty, the Abode of Peace was their place. But,One group reached the spheres, another the pit- alas at Your threats toward a handful of dust!On the heads of one group He placed the crown of generosity:"
