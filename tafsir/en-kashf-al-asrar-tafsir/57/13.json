When the wind of good fortune blew from the direction of gentleness and generosity, it left neither sorcery nor any sorcerer, neither unbelief nor any unbeliever. In the morning they were busy with the sin of unbelief and denial, and in the evening they were at the side of faith and asking forgiveness.Shaykh Abū Saʿīd Abu'l-Khayr said, \ufffdWhoever picks up a burden from the garden of solici- tude will put it down in the playing field of friendship. Whoever sucks milk from the breast of kind favor will be nurtured in the embrace of protection.\ufffd[The Master Abū ʿAlī said,] \ufffdWhoever is given familiarity in the morning can hope for for- giveness in the evening.\ufffd"
