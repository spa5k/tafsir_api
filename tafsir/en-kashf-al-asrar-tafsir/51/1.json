  "text": "By the scatterers scattering.This is an allusion to the dawn winds that carry the moaning of the yearners to the courtyards of exaltedness, then bring the breeze of proximity to the nostrils of the secret cores of the folk of love, letting them find ease from the overpowering force of rapture.I will let the winds guide me to your breezewhen their blowing comes from your direction.I will ask them to carry my greetings to you. If they arrive one day, respond to me!When the announcers of the good news of dawn appear, the army of brightness breaks out of its ambush, and the east wind begins to blow love into the world's air, then a dawn wind is sent into the road like a messenger from the Gardens of Eden in order to convey the divine inbreathings to the nostrils of the secret cores of the friends. Exalted is the hour and great the moment when, on the carpet of We are nearer [50:16] in the seclusion of He is with you [57:4], He conveys the wine of \ufffdI am the sitting companion of him who remembers Me\ufffd to His friends, secret to secret, without the intrusion of others! In the attribute of clemency the caller of exaltedness calls out in the world of being so as to caress the poor: \ufffdWho will lend to one who is neither lacking nor wrongdoing?\ufffd What wonder if at that moment He says in the heart of the servant, \ufffdMy servant, fear not, thou art among the secure\ufffd [28:31]."
