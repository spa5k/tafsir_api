He knew that knowledge of the time of the resurrection was not with MuṣṬafā, for this verse had come-\ufffdSurely God-He has knowledge of the Hour.\ufffd But in wishing to see the Real he wanted to talk, because of his passion's pain and burning. He said, \ufffdO Messen- ger of God. There is a drink that I placed in the hand of my need several years ago, and the promise has been given that it will be drunk at the resurrection. When will the time come when I will drink it down and take my ease in contemplating the perfect beauty without end and beginning?\ufffdMuṣṬafā knew where his pain was coming from and what its remedy would be. He said, \ufffdWhat have you done that you ask about that way station? How is it that you hope for it?\ufffdThe nomad said, \ufffdI have not done much prayer and fasting, but I love God and the Messenger.\ufffdMuṣṬafā said, \ufffdA man will be with the one he loves.\ufffd Tomorrow, everyone will be with the one he loves today.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdThe evidence of having found friendship is throwing the two worlds into the ocean. The mark of realizing friendship is turning away from other than the Real. The beginning of friendship is a wound, and its end a lamp. The beginning of friendship is distress, its middle waiting, and its end vision.\ufffdWhat harm if you suffer for a hundred yearsso long as you see the Friend in vision some day?A poet said,Perhaps the distress with which I awoke will be followed by quick relief.*I said to my heart, \ufffdGive it no thoughtfor our work will be opened by the Opener of work.\ufffd"
