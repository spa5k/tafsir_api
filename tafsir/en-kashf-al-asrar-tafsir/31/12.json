  "text": "And We gave Luqmān wisdom.Know that wisdom is correct activity or correct speech. Correct activity is to preserve the balance of interaction with self between fear and hope, with the people between tenderness and cajolery, and with the Real between awe and intimacy. Correct speech is that you do not mix levity with the mention of the Real, you preserve reverence, and you connect the end of every talk with its begin- ning. The wise man is he who puts everything in its own place, does each work as is worthy of that work, and ties each thing to its equal.This wisdom comes forth from someone who renounces this world and perseveres in worship. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdWhen someone is a renunciant in this world, God will give wisdom a home in his heart and bring his tongue to speech with it.\ufffdʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib said, \ufffdVivify the hearts and seek for them the fine qualities of wisdom, for they become weary just as bodies become weary.\ufffdḤusayn ibn Manṣūr said, \ufffdWisdom is an arrow, and the hearts of the faithful are its targets.The shooter is God, so error is made nonexistent.\ufffdIt has been said, \ufffdWisdom is God-given knowledge.\ufffdIt has also been said, \ufffdIt is the light that distinguishes between inspiration and Satanic dis- quiet.\ufffdIt was said to one of them, \ufffdWhence is born this light in the heart?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdFrom reflective thought and heedfulness, and these are bequeathed by sorrow and hunger.\ufffd"
