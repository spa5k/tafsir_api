  "text": "They recognize God's blessings, then they deny them.Some people say that this concerns the Muslims. For a time they occupy themselves with obedi- ence and undertake the path of discipline and struggle according to the Shariah. But in the end, self-admiration comes and ambushes them, destroying their obedience. Their self-admiration is that they consider their obedience and worship as service pleasing to God, and this brings them to exultation and happiness: \ufffdThis is my attribute and my strength.\ufffd They remain heedless that it is God's blessings and bounty toward them. Then they do not fear the disappearance of the blessings and they go forth feeling secure.MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdA man's destruction lies in three things: One is niggardliness that he obeys, another is the soul's caprice that he follows, and the third is admiring himself.\ufffdOne of the great ones of the religion said, \ufffdIf I sleep all night and in the morning feel broken and fearful, I like that more than spending the night in prayer and admiring myself in the morning.\ufffd ʿAbdallāh ibn Masʿūd said, \ufffdThe destruction of a man's religion lies in two things: self- admiration and despair.\ufffd He said this because anyone who loses hope will stop seeking and be overcome by lassitude, so he will not worship. So also, anyone who admires himself will fancy that he does not need to seek, for his work is right and he has been forgiven."
