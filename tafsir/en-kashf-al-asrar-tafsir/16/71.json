  "text": "And God has given more bounty in provision to some of you than others.The provision of the soul is one thing, the provision of the heart another, and the provision of the spirit still another. For some the provision of the soul is the success of obedience and for some it is abandonment to disobedience. For some the provision of the heart is the heart's presence with constant remembrance and for some it is the attribute of heedlessness with constant hardness. For some the provision of the spirit is the perfection of recognition and the limpidness of love and for some it is love for this world and occupation with attachments.Fuáº“ayl said, \ufffdThe greatest thing provided to man is deeds that will lead him to rectitude and recognition that will bequeath on him contemplation of his Lord.\ufffdThe Prophet said, \ufffdI spend the night at my Lord; He gives me to eat and drink.\ufffd"
