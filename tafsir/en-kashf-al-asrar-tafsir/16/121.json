  "text": "Surely Abraham was a community, devoted to God and unswerving, not among the associaters, grateful for His blessings. He chose him and guided him to a straight path.Abraham said, \ufffdO Lord, You were all [that I saw], and You are all.\ufffdSo God said, \ufffdThe community is you yourself. You are the togetherness of all, and that's it.\ufffd Indeed, \ufffdWhen someone belongs to God, God belongs to him.\ufffdThen He says, \ufffdgrateful for His blessings.\ufffd Abraham discharged gratitude for blessings, for he recognized the Patron of Blessings. He accepted the decree without protest and he approved of whatever came forth without unwillingness. He chose him and guided him to a straight path. He saw the road of servanthood and he went straight in servanthood. He knew that he did not see that road by himself, for it was shown to him, nor did he reach it by the effort of servanthood, for he was made to reach it.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, do You know what has made me happy? I did not fall to You by myself. O God, You wanted-it was not I who wanted. I saw the Friend at my pillow when I woke up from sleep.\ufffdHer love came to me before I knew love-it came across a carefree heart and took possession."
