  "text": "We gave David bounty from Us.In the reports about David, it has come that he used to read the Psalms, and the name of sinners came up a great deal. Because of jealousy and solidity in the religion, he said, \ufffdO God, do not forgive those who misstep!\ufffd Lord God, do not forgive the sinners!It was said to him, \ufffdO David, such lack of tenderness toward the sinners! Wait, until MuḤammad the Arab sets foot into the circle of existence and asks forgiveness for the only one of his community not to sin: 'Forgive me for what I did before and what I will do after!'\ufffdThen the tongue of destiny said to David, \ufffdO David, you have remained in the bonds of your own purity. Wait until you are slapped by the hand of the decree and destiny. Then you will know what you said and where you stood.\ufffdGabriel came to the road and said, \ufffdO David, the arrow of the decree has been loosed from the bow of destiny. Be careful, watch out for yourself if you can!\ufffdDavid sat in the prayer-niche in bewilderment and regret, his eyes fixed on the Psalms, busy with remembrance and worship, until the episode happened with the bird and his eyes fell on the wife of Uriah. This story will be given in detail in the Surah of Sād [38], God willing. In the end, David was saying, \ufffdO God, forgive the sinners-perhaps You will forgive David along with them.\ufffd"
