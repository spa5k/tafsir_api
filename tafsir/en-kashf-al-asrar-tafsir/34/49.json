This is God's messenger in truth, so bear witness. If what he says is true, then prostrate yourselves!\ufffd The idols all at once fell down in prostration.O chevalier! Which day will it be when the messenger of realization along with the ʿUmar of assent enters the Kaabah of your breast at the instruction of success-giving? It will topple the idols of caprice and avarice, and they will call out, \ufffdThe truth has come, and falsehood does not originate, nor make return.\ufffd\ufffdSo the sorcerers were cast down in prostration [7:120]. What do you say? Did they come and prostrate themselves? Or did We bring them into prostration?\ufffdA serving boy was walking with his master. The boy went into a mosque, said his prayers, and remained for a long time in the pleasure of whispered prayer. The master said, \ufffdCome out, boy!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdHe won't let me.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdWho won't let you come out?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdThe same one who won't let you come in.\ufffdIt is no wonder that a hearing, speaking, knowing person should prostrate himself. The won- der is that ʿUmar said, \ufffdO unhearing, unspeaking idols, if MuḤammad's religion is the truth, pros- trate yourselves,\ufffd and at once all of them prostrated themselves.O pure Lord! Two improper, ugly things were placed before ʿUmar: enmity toward the Mes- senger and coveting this world. Then there appeared such a beautiful state from their midst, for ʿUmar was adorned with the ornament of submission. In the same way, two improper things were placed before Pharaoh's sorcerers: one enmity toward Moses and the other Pharaoh's rulership. Then from the midst an exalted secret appeared, so the sorcerers were cast down in prostration."
