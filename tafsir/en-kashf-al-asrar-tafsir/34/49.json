This is God's messenger in truth, so bear witness. If what he says is true, then prostrate yourselves!” The idols all at once fell down in prostration. O chevalier! Which day will it be when the messenger of realization along with the ʿUmar of assent enters the Kaabah of your breast at the instruction of success-giving? It will topple the idols of caprice and avarice, and they will call out, “The truth has come, and falsehood does not originate, nor make return.” “So the sorcerers were cast down in prostration [7:120]. What do you say? Did they come and prostrate themselves? Or did We bring them into prostration?” A serving boy was walking with his master. The boy went into a mosque, said his prayers, and remained for a long time in the pleasure of whispered prayer. The master said, “Come out, boy!” He said, “He won't let me.” He said, “Who won't let you come out?” He said, “The same one who won't let you come in.” It is no wonder that a hearing, speaking, knowing person should prostrate himself. The won- der is that ʿUmar said, “O unhearing, unspeaking idols, if MuḤammad's religion is the truth, pros- trate yourselves,” and at once all of them prostrated themselves. O pure Lord! Two improper, ugly things were placed before ʿUmar: enmity toward the Mes- senger and coveting this world. Then there appeared such a beautiful state from their midst, for ʿUmar was adorned with the ornament of submission. In the same way, two improper things were placed before Pharaoh's sorcerers: one enmity toward Moses and the other Pharaoh's rulership. Then from the midst an exalted secret appeared, so the sorcerers were cast down in prostration.  Two arduous tribulations were placed before Joseph: one the well and the other the prison. Then from their midst Joseph's rulership and ruling authority appeared: Thus did We establish Joseph in the earth [12:56]. Two feeble drops were brought together in the womb. Then from their midst such a lovely form appeared: And He formed you, so He made your forms beautiful [40:64]. Two impurities were brought together in the makeup of the animal, one feces and the other blood. Then from their midst pure milk appeared: between feces and blood, pure milk [16:66]. Two difficult tasks were combined for the servant: one disobedience, the other shortcoming in obedience. Then from their midst mercy and forgiveness appeared: He will make your deeds wholesome for you and forgive you your sins [33:71]."
