  "text": "Surely thou wilt not make the dead to hear.In reality, life is three things, and any heart that is empty of these three things is in fact carrion and counted as dead: the life of fear along with knowledge, the life of hope along with knowledge, and the life of friendship along with knowledge.The life of fear keeps a man's skirt pure of defilement, his eyes awake, and his road straight. The life of hope keeps a man's steed quick, his traveling supplies complete, and the road near. The life of friendship makes a man's measure great, his secret core free, and his heart happy.Fear without knowledge is the fear of the Khawarij, hope without knowledge is the hope of the Murji'ah, and friendship without knowledge is the friendship of the libertines.Anyone who combines these three traits with knowledge will reach a pure life and be released from death. The Lord of the Worlds says, \ufffdWe shall surely give him to live a goodly life [16:97]. I will make them live a pure life, disowned of self and free of the whole world.\ufffdDisown everything in the realm of being-be that Heart-taker's \ufffdcompanion of the cave.\ufffdThe chevaliers are those to whom He gave access to face-to-face vision, and they made do with that. When the veil was lifted, they turned away from all creation. They took back the skirt of at- tachments from the hands of the creatures.Her love came to me before I knew love-it came across an empty heart and took possession."
