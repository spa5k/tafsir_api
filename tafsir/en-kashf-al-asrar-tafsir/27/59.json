  "text": "Say: \" The praise belongs to God, and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen. \"Know that the stations of the religion's road are of two sorts: One sort are called the preliminar- ies, for they are not the goal in themselves. These are like repentance, patience, fear, renuncia- tion, poverty, and self-accounting, all of which are the means of approach to something beyond themselves.The second sort are called the destinations or the ends, for they are the goal in themselves. These are like love, yearning, approval, tawḤīd, and trust, all of which are goals in themselves. They are not needed as the means of approach to something else. Praise of God and thanking and lauding Him are of this sort, for they are goals in themselves. Anything that is a goal in itself will remain at the resurrection and will never be cut off in paradise.Praise pertains to this category because the Exalted Lord says about the attribute of the par- adise-dwellers, \" And the last of their supplication will be 'Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds' \" [10:10]; \" Praise belongs to God, who has put away sorrow from us \" [35:34]; \" Praise belongs to God, who was truthful in His promise to us \" [39:74].In the Splendorous Qur'an He linked gratitude and praise with remembrance when He says, \" So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful for Me and not ungrateful toward Me \" [2:152]. Tomorrow, at the most tremendous courtyard and greatest gathering place, when the portico of magnificence is raised and the carpet of tremendousness spread, a caller will call out, \" Let the praisers stand up! \" At this time no one will stand up except those who in all states and times were constantly praising and thanking God and showing the rightful due of gratitude for His blessings.The servant will not become sound in the station of gratitude and praise unless three things exist in him: first knowledge, second state, and third deed. First is knowledge; from knowledge the state is born, and from state the deed rises up. Knowledge is recognizing the blessings from the Lord. State is the heart's happiness with those blessings. He alludes to this with His words, \" In that let them rejoice \" [10:58]."
