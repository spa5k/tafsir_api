  "text": "When We built for Abraham the place of the House: \ufffdAssociate nothing with Me, and make My house pure for those who circumambulate, stand, and bow in prostration.\ufffdIbn ʿAṬāÌ said, \ufffdWe gave him the success to build the House, We gave him the ability to do so, We helped him with it, and We said to him, 'Associate nothing with Me,' that is, 'Do not have any regard for the House and do not look at the fact that you built it.'\ufffdHe is saying, \ufffdWe gave Abraham ability and We gave him means, tools, strength, skill, power, and help so that he could build the house of the Kaabah as We wanted and commanded. Then We said to him, 'Do not look at what you have done and what you have made. Look at Our success- giving and Our help. Do not look at your striving but see Our desire and solicitude.\ufffdO chevalier! The servant was given two eyes so that with one eye he would see the attributes of his own soul's blights and with the other eye the gentle attributes of the Real's generosity. With one eye he sees His bounty, with the other eye his own acts. When he sees His bounty, he boasts of it, and when he sees his own acts he shows poverty. When he sees the generosity of the Begin- ningless, he becomes joyful, and when he sees the footsteps of dust's nonexistence, he becomes needful.That distracted man of ʿIrāq [Shiblī], burnt by the fire of separation, used to say, \ufffdWould that I were fuel for the furnace and had not heard this tale!\ufffdSometimes he would say, \ufffdWhere are the proximate angels and residents of the Holy Pali- sades?! Let them spread their carpets before the throne of my good fortune and the chair of my exaltedness!\ufffdSometimes my hands are full of silver, sometimes I'm poor.Sometimes my heart's elated, sometimes wounded. Sometimes I'm behind the people, sometimes ahead-I indeed am the chameleon of the days.And make My house pure. In the tongue of learning, this is the Kaabah, but according to the expla- nation by allusion, the meaning is, \ufffdEmpty your heart of all things save the remembrance of God.\ufffd He is saying, \ufffdOccupy your heart totally with My remembrance and do not give any stranger or other access to it, for the heart is the container of the wine of My affection and love."
