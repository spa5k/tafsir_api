  "text": "They measured not God with the rightful due of His measure. Surely God is strong, exalted.WāsiṬī said, \ufffdCreatures do not recognize the rightful due of His measure-only the Real.\ufffd No one knows His measure save He. No one can recognize Him as is worthy of Him save He. Intellects are confounded and understandings bewildered at the beginnings of the shining of His majesty. Prophets and messengers came back on the feet of incapacity from the threshold of the reality of recognizing Him.O chevalier, tomorrow when the servants reach the exaltedness of union with Him and see the marks bearing witness to proximity, He will bestow the vision of Himself in the measure of your capacity, not in the measure of His tremendousness and majesty. This is why it has been said, \ufffdHe spoke to Moses in respect of Moses. Had He spoken to Moses in respect of His tremendousness, Moses would have melted.\ufffd"
