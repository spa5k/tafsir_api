  "text": "Say: \ufffdThe vile and the goodly are not equal, even if the manyness of the vile stirs you to admiration.\ufffdIn the tongue of the Shariah, the vile is the forbidden, and the goodly is the permitted. In the tongue of the Haqiqah, every occupation that is empty of the mention and remembrance of the Real is vile; and every occupation at the beginning of which comes the Real's name, in the middle of which is the witnessing of the Real, and at the end of which is praise and gratitude is goodly.ʿāÌisha the sincerely truthful commanded that a shirt be sewn. The person who was sew- ing seems to have been heedless of remembering the Real. His heedlessness became known to ʿāÌisha. She commanded him to undo the sewing. She said, \ufffdThis is vile, and the vile is not ap- propriate for me.\ufffdIt has been said that every wealth from which God's rightful due is taken and the alms tax given is goodly, and everything from which it is not taken is vile and on the edge of destruction. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdNo property is wasted in the land and the sea except by holding back its alms tax.\ufffdIt has also been said that the vile is what you accumulate and store up in this world, holding it back from the hand of expenditure and good. The goodly is what you send forth for yourselves, spend in the good, and store up for the next world. This is the meaning of \ufffdWhat we sent forward was our gain, and what we left behind was our loss,\ufffd which was already mentioned."
