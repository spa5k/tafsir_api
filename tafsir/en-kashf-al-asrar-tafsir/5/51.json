Surely God does not guide the wrongdoers.The majestic compeller, the great Lord, the knower to perfection, the exalted Possessor of Maj- esty, calls to His servants with a call of generosity. By way of gentleness He caresses them and in the attribute of clemency and mercy He turns the faces of their hearts away from others toward Himself. He is saying, \ufffdDo not take the stranger as friend, and do not approve of the enemy for your companionship. When you take a friend and take a companion, approve of him for the sake of God. Take the friend in God's work and approve of the companion in God's religion. When you seek the realities of faith, seek them from friendship with God's friends and enmity with the enemies of the religion.\ufffdMuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThe firmest handle of faith is love in God and hate in God.\ufffdThe enemies of the religion whose enmity is obligatory are first Satan, and second the com- manding soul. The soul is harder than Satan, for Satan does not go after the faith of the faithful, but rather their disobedience. The soul, however, pulls him to unbelief and wants his unbelief. Satan flees from [the formula] \ufffdThere is no power and no strength but in God,\ufffd but the soul does not flee. Joseph the sincerely truthful suffered many trials-he was thrown into the well, sold into slav-ery, and remained in prison for years-but he never lamented the way he did at the commanding soul: \ufffdSurely the soul commands to ugliness\ufffd [12:53]. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdYour worst enemy is the soul between your two sides.\ufffd"
