If servanthood is what you have, then what do we have? What can we hope for? This is a place for despair.\ufffdThat pir said, \ufffdThe army of the commander is not all special friends and boon companions. There are also dog-keepers and herdsmen. In the empire, all are useful and all live in their own places and their own measures.\ufffdThough you be beautiful, do not disdain the ugly,for in this realm flies are as useful as peacocks. [DS 307]You should consider exalted the state of the dervish who said in his whispered prayer, \ufffdO God, approve of me as a lover! If you do not approve of me as a lover, approve of me as a servant! If you do not approve of me as a servant, approve of me as a dog!\ufffdO friend, if you won't give me the forefront of respect, at least keep me outside the door like the dogs."
