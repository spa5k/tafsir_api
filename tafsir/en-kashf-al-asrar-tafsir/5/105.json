  "text": "O you who have faith! Against you are your own souls. Those who are misguided cannot hurt you if you are guided.The tongue of commentary is what I explained. The tongue of allusion in keeping with the tasting of the folk of desire is this: \ufffdO faithful, beware! Subjugate your own soul before it subjugates you. Busy it with obedience before it busies you with disobedience.\ufffdWhen Abū ʿUthmān was asked about this verse, he replied, \ufffdAgainst you is your own soul. If you occupy yourself with making its corruption wholesome and concealing its shameful parts, you will be too busy to gaze on the creatures and to occupy yourself with them.\ufffdḤusayn Manṣūr Ḥallāj gave advice to his disciple, saying, \ufffdAgainst you is your own soul-if you do not keep it busy, it will keep you busy.\ufffdMuḤammad ibn ʿAlī said, \ufffdAgainst you is your own soul-if you spare the creatures its evil, you will have taken care of most of its rightful due.\ufffdThe nature of the soul is always to be at rest with this world and to hurry toward disobedience. It counts disobedience as a small thing and is lazy in obedience. It is conceited and acts with eye- service toward the creatures. Within it are found associationism, eye-service, and hypocrisy. It is said, \ufffdThe soul is duplicitous in all its states, hypocritical in most of its states, and an associater in some of its states.\ufffdAbū Yazīd BasṬāmī said, \ufffdIf in that world the Lord says to me, 'Make a wish,' I will ask per- mission to enter hell to punish this soul, for in this world it has always made me writhe and suffer.\ufffd MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdYour worst enemy is your soul between your two sides.\ufffd He said this because when you get along with an enemy, you become secure from his evil, but when you get along with your own soul, you will perish. If you act well toward someone, he will thank you at the resurrec- tion, and if you act badly, he will complain. The state of the soul is the opposite: If you act well toward it in this house, it will be your antagonist in that house, and if you act badly toward it in thishouse, it will thank you in that house."
