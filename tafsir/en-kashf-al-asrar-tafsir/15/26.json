  "text": "Surely We created man of a dried clay of fetid mud.It has been narrated that Ibn ʿUmar had taken up the sessions. Kaʿb said to a man among those sitting with him, \ufffdAsk Ibn ʿUmar from what God created Adam.\ufffdIbn ʿUmar said, \ufffdHe created Adam from five things: clay, water, fire, light, and wind.\ufffdAt Ibn ʿUmar's response, Kaʿb said, \ufffdSit with him, for surely he is a man of knowledge.\ufffd What is understood from this report is that the Exalted Lord created Adam from five things:clay, water, fire, light, and wind. The wisdom in this is that the Exalted Lord created every one of His creatures from one kind. He created the angels from light and He created the jinn from fire. These are the light of exaltedness and the fire of exaltedness, which is why Iblis swore by exaltedness [38:82], for he was created from the fire of exaltedness and the angels from the light of exaltedness.God created the birds from wind, He created the beasts and the crawling things of the earth from dust, and He created the creatures of the sea from water. He created each from one kind, but He created Adam from all of these kinds so as to honor him and make him eminent. Thus he would be superior to all the creatures of the world. All are subjected to him, and he is given ruling power over all. This is why the Lord of the Worlds says, \ufffdWe indeed honored the children of Adam, and We carried them on land and sea, and We provided them with goodly things, and We made them much more excellent than many of those We created\ufffd [17:70]."
