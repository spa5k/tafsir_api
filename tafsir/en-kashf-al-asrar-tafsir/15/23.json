  "text": "Surely We give life and We make die.We give the hearts of the recognizers life through contemplation, and We make their souls die through struggle.We bring the hearts of the recognizers to life with contemplation, and We make their bodies die through struggle. The soul is the veil of the heart. As long as the veil is before the heart, the heart is deprived of contemplation. When the soul is killed by struggle according to the Shariah, the life of the heart begins. Guidance arrives, contemplation joins. Those who struggle in Us, We will guide them on Our paths [29:69].It has also been said, \ufffdWe give the desirers life through remembering Us and We make the heedless die through separation from Us.\ufffd"
