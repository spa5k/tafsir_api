  "text": "And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and beautiful doing toward your parents.In this verse the wise Lord, the eternal Enactor, the lovingly kind and generous Beautiful-Doer commands the servants to servanthood. Servanthood is three things: seeing favor, striving in service, and fear of the end. Seeing favor belongs to Abraham the bosom friend, who said, \ufffdWho created me, so He is guiding me\ufffd [26:78]. Striving in service belongs to MuḤammad the beloved, to whom it was said, \ufffdWe did not send down the Qur'an upon thee for thee to be wretched\ufffd [20:2]. Fear of the end belongs to Joseph the sincerely truthful, who said, \ufffdReceive me as a submitter\ufffd[12:101]. When someone stands in the field of servanthood in the row of service and sets his feet in the clay of what he desires, making the Exalted Presence the Kaabah of his wishes, God will put the folk of the empire into his service and will take care of his work in the two worlds without him. This is why MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdWhen someone belongs to God, God belongs to him.\ufffd When- ever someone has no watchfulness in servanthood, he will have no contemplation on the carpet of proximity.Know also that the wayfarers in the road of servanthood are three men: One is the worshiper, whose soul is subjugated by the fear of punishment. One is the recognizer, whose heart is subju- gated by the forcefulness of proximity. One is the lover, whose spirit is subjugated by the unveil- ing of the Haqiqah.Whenever the worshiper wants to lift away the bond of struggle from his days, at once he looks at the title-page of the Real's rebuke and throws down his head in the station of shame.Whenever the recognizer wants to make manifest the banner of happiness and expansiveness by virtue of proximity, at once the ruling power of the Real's awesomeness appears and he falls into the lowland of confoundedness.Whenever the lover gazes at majesty, at once he melts in awe, seeing only bewilderment in bewilderment. Whenever he gazes at beauty, he delights in happiness and revelry, seeing only light and joy. In the tongue of his state he says,\ufffdYour beauty is my pleasure, Your approval my delight, and among all the religions Your love is my religion."
