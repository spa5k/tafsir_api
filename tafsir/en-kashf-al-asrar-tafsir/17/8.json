  "text": "Perhaps your Lord will have mercy upon you. And if you return, We will return.This verse is a strong handhold and a beautiful caress for the hopeful. In other words, \ufffdPerhaps He who nurtures you and feeds you with His bounty will have mercy upon you. There is hope that the Lord who created you gratis out of His bounty, who nourished you with His blessings, who kept you in His guarding and solicitude with His gentleness, and who preserved you from blights and disliked things will have mercy on you in the end and finish the work that He Himself began with bounty.\ufffdAnd if you return, We will return. Sahl ibn ʿAbdallāh said, \ufffdIf you return to fleeing from Us, We will return to taking the path against you so that you will return to Us.\ufffd This is just like what MuṣṬafā said, recounting from God: \ufffdWhen I know that occupation with Me has overpowered My servant's heart, I put My servant's appetite into asking from Me and whispering to Me. When My servant is like that and he desires to be negligent of Me, I come between him and his negligence of Me.\ufffd"
