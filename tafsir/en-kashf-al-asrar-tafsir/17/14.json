Thy soul suffices thee today as a reckoner against thee.\ufffdRead your book and see your own deeds.\ufffd If you deny one letter of it, that very bodily member from which that deed went forth will testify against you, as God says: \ufffdOn the day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet bear witness against them concerning what they were doing\ufffd [24:24]. This is why He says, \ufffdThy soul suffices thee today as a reckoner against thee,\ufffd that is, as a witness of what came from you against you.It has been said that the books are two: One is written by the angel against the servant, and that is his words and deeds; the other is written by the Real against Himself, and that is His pardon and mercy toward the servant. If the beginningless solicitude takes the servant by the hand, His reckoning with him will be from the book of His own mercy, not the book of the servant's deeds. This is just like what has come in the traditions: When the servant's book is placed in his hands, it is said, \ufffdRead thy book!\ufffd The servant looks into the book and sees written on the first page, \ufffdIn the name of God, the All-Merciful, the Ever-Merciful.\ufffd He says, \ufffdLord God, first dis-charge for me the account for this one line and issue its decree for me.\ufffdGod says, \ufffdMy servant! I have taken account of it and I have forgiven you through My bounty and mercy. In the Beginningless, I wrote mercy for you and said about Myself, 'Forgiver of sins and Accepter of repentance' [40:3].\ufffdThy soul suffices thee today as a reckoner against thee. ʿUmar KhaṬṬāb said, \ufffdTake an account- ing of yourselves before you are brought to account, weigh your deeds before they are weighed, and prepare for the Greatest Exposure.\ufffd Anyone who is aware of the Tribunal of Wrongdoing and the calling to account at the resurrection, who has found a whiff of the recognition of the states and terrors of that day, should know that whatever was his companion during his days-little and much, spots and specks-its talk will be asked from him tomorrow and he will be called to account for it. Hence today he should lift the veil of heedlessness away from his road and keep his deeds and words straight in keeping with the yardstick of the Shariah."
