  "text": "They fall down on their faces weeping.Weeping is the state of the beginners and the attribute of the travelers-everyone according to his own state and every traveler in the measure of his own deeds. The repenter looks upon his own sin and weeps in fear of punishment. The obedient person looks upon his own lax obedience and weeps in fear of shortcoming. The worshiper weeps in fear of the outcome: \ufffdWhat will be done with me tomorrow?\ufffd The recognizer looks at the beginningless precedent and weeps: \ufffdWhat was done to me and decreed for me in the Beginningless?\ufffdAll this happens to travelers on the path and is a mark of the weakness of their state. As for those who have been snatched away from themselves, the folk of stability, for them weeping is an imperfection and defect in their road. Thus it is related that Junayd was sitting with his wife and Shiblī entered. The wife wanted to cover herself, but Junayd said to her, \ufffdShiblī is not aware of you, so sit.\ufffd Junayd kept speaking to her, and then Shiblī wept. When Shiblī began to weep, Junayd said to his wife, \ufffdCover yourself, for Shiblī has come back from absence to awareness.\ufffd"
