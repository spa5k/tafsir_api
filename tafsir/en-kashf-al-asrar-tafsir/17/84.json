  "text": "Say: \ufffdEach acts according to his own manner.\ufffdWhat comes from the Adamite other than disloyalty? What comes from water and clay other than error? What will be seen from the Lord's generosity other than loyalty?In the whole Qur'an, no verse offers more hope than this. He is saying, \ufffdEveryone does what comes from him, and from everyone comes what is worthy of him. The servant returns to sin and the Lord returns to forgiveness.\ufffdOne of revealed books tells us that God said, \ufffdO child of Adam! You keep on returning to sins, and I keep on returning to forgiveness.\ufffdIt was said to the abandoned one of the empire, the despairing Iblis, \ufffdProstrate yourself before Adam!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdI will not, for Adam is from dust, and I am from fire.\ufffdIt was said to him, \ufffdO unlucky one! No doubt everyone does what is worthy of him, and from everyone comes what is inside him. When fire dies down, it becomes ashes, which can never be renewed. Dust, even if it is old, is renewed by sprinkling water on it. O Iblis, O you who are of fire, you left aside one command, so you will die and never come to life! O Adam, O you who are of dust, you let one tear of remorse fall from your eyes, so I have forgiven your sins and will caress you. O Iblis, what you did comes from fire. O Adam, what you saw is born of dust. Say: 'Each acts according to his own manner.'\ufffd"
