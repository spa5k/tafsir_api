  "text": "Man supplicates for evil just as he supplicates for good.Sahl said, \ufffdThe safest of supplications is remembrance and the abandonment of choice in supplica- tion and asking, for in remembrance there is sufficiency, and perchance man will supplicate and ask for that within which is his destruction, while he is not aware. Do you not see that God says, 'Man supplicates for evil just as he supplicates for good.'\ufffdWhen someone remembers constantly and abandons choice in supplicating and asking, the best of his wishes will be freely given to him and the blights of asking and choice will fall away from him. The Prophet said, recounting from his Lord, \ufffdWhen someone's remembrance of Me keeps him too busy to ask from Me, I will give him the best of what I give to the askers.\ufffd"
