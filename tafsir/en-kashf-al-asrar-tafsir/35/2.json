  "text": "Whatever mercy God opens up to the people, none shall hold it back.In terms of understanding in the tongue of the Tariqah, this verse alludes to the opening of the folk of faith and recognition. Opening is a name for what comes from the Unseen unsought and unasked for. It is of two sorts: One is the influxes of provision and delightful life, unsought and unearned. The other is God-given knowledge, unlearned, conforming to the Shariah, never before heard, but familiar to the heart.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdAlas for this unlearnt knowledge! Sometimes I'm drowned in it, sometimes burnt by it.\ufffdIn respect of this knowledge the speaker is the ocean, sometimes in flow, sometimes in ebb. When he stands in the station of expansiveness, he fills the world with limpidness. When he stands in the station of awe, he fills the world with human nature.Among the sorts of opening are beautiful dreams, the supplications of good people, and the acceptance of hearts. According to a report, \ufffdWhen God loves a servant, the folk of the heavens and the earth love him, and acceptance is placed for him in the earth.\ufffd"
