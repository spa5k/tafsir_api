  "text": "God surely helped you at Badr while you were abased.He wrote this inscription of abasement for them in respect of number and the view of the commonpeople. But, in respect of the view of the elect and the reality of the work, how can it be said that someone is lowly and abased when God is his helper?The Pir of the Tariqah said in his whispered prayers, \ufffdO Lord, in recognizing You we are alive, with Your help we are happy, with Your generosity we are joyful, through Your exalting we are exalted. O Lord, in You we are alive, so how can we ever die? In You we are happy, so how can we ever be sorrowful? In You we are joyful, so how can we live without You? In You we are exalted, so how can we ever be abased?\ufffdA man entered in on Hārūn al-Rashīd and commanded him to do the honorable. Hārūn be- came angry and put him inside a room with a lion, with the door firmly shut. The lion entered in upon the man with humility and did not harm him. After that, they saw him in the midst of the gar- den, happily gazing at it, and the door to the room was firmly locked as it had been. They reported his state to Hārūn, and he summoned him. He said, \ufffdWho let you out of the room?\ufffdHe answered, \ufffdThe one who brought me into the garden.\ufffd He said, \ufffdWho brought you into the garden?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdThe one who brought me out of the room.\ufffdHārūn commanded that they should put him on a seat with exaltation and honor and carry him around the city, with a caller going before him saying, \ufffdBehold, Hārūn al-Rashīd wanted to abase a servant exalted by God, and he was unable to do so.\ufffd"
