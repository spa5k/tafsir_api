  "text": "It belongs to no mortal man that God should give him the Book, the judgment, and prophet- hood, and then he should say to the people, \ufffdBe servants of me instead of God!\ufffd But, \ufffdBe you lordly ones from having taught the Book and from having studied!\ufffdBefore giving existence to the universe and creating Adam, the majestic compeller, the great God, the renowned enactor, knew in His eternal knowledge who among the children of Adam would be worthy of prophethood and friendship and who would be qualified for love and suited for messen- gerhood. God knows better where to place His message [6:124]. How can he upon whom He has placed the brand of deprivation and the inscription of unawareness be sinless and truthful on the road today? And how can he to whom He has given good fortune gratis and whom He has placed on the road of truthfulness and sinlessness be roadless and bad in state today? So, what will take form and how can it enter into imagination? It could never happen that the chosen MuṣṬafā and the caressed Jesus, after the honor of prophethood, the confirmation of sinlessness, and the strength of messengerhood, take a step out of line and say to the people, \ufffdBe servants of me instead of God!\ufffdBy virtue of the beginningless choice and eternal solicitude, the Lord of the Worlds answered on their behalf as their deputy: \ufffdThey do not say this. Rather they say, 'Be you lordly ones!'\ufffd In other words: Be among those singled out for God, those who are described by His words, \ufffdWhen I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears and his eyesight with which he sees.\ufffdIn keeping with the tasting of the folk of recognition, the lordly ones are those who become one for God with disengaged intention, sound trust, and intimacy's breeze. They step beyond the two worlds and seize hold of the gentleness of the Patron's love. They say the prayer of the dead for their own attributes.When someone steps into the field of passion for the beautiful,night and day will recite for him the prayer of the dead. [DS 210]They have souls undergoing annihilation and hearts full of thirst. They have burnt souls, secret cores lit by passion, and spirits hanging in hope."
