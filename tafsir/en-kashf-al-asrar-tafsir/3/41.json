  "text": "He said, \ufffdMy Lord, appoint for me a sign.\ufffd He said, \ufffdYour sign is that you shall not speak to the people for three days, except by intimation. And remember thy Lord often and glorify Him at evening and dawn.\ufffdZachariah asked for a mark of his child's existence. It was said to him, \ufffdThe mark is that I will stop your tongue from talking to the people for three days so that all your secret whispering will be with Me, and all on your tongue will be talk of Me.\ufffdBy way of allusion He is saying, \ufffdI will give you a child whom I will cut off from this world and the creatures and the face of whose heart I will turn toward Me. Then he will know that his kiblah is nothing but My Presence and he will be at ease only in talking with Me.\ufffdOnly Your name, image, and passion, O Spirit of the world, appear to me in speech, heart, and eyes.This is why He commanded Zachariah, \ufffdAnd remember thy Lord often and glorify Him at evening and dawn.\ufffd He commanded the faithful in general to the same thing: \ufffdAnd remember your Lord often\ufffd [8:45]. He is saying, \ufffdRemember God, and carry out your days in obedience and service to Him. Belong totally to Him, calling upon Him and knowing Him in every state and every work! If you are at ease, be at ease with His remembrance and message, and if you are joyful, be joyful in His name and mark.Once in a while knock on the door of My house- it is not right to pass by like a stranger.And if you talk, talk only of Me,and if you drink, drink only in remembrance of Me.And remember thy Lord often. It is said that remembrance of God has three degrees: The first is outward remembrance with the tongue of laudation and supplication. God says, \ufffdAnd remember thy Lord often.\ufffdSecond is concealed remembrance in the heart. Thus God says, \ufffdOr with more intense remem- brance\ufffd [2:200]. The Prophet said, \ufffdThe best remembrance is the concealed and the best provision the sufficient.\ufffdThird is true remembrance, which is witnessing God's remembrance of you. That is His words, \ufffdAnd remember thy Lord when thou forgettest\ufffd [18:24]."
