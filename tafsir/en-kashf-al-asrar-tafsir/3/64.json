  "text": "Say: \ufffdO Folk of the Book! Come to a word common between us and you: that we worship none but God, that we associate nothing with Him, and that some of us not take others of us as lords apart from God.\ufffdIn terms of realization, this is addressed to the folk of tawḤīd and the desirers on the road of the Haqiqah. He is saying, \ufffdIf you who are traveling on the path of truthfulness today want to be dwellers in the seat of truthfulness [54:55] tomorrow, be careful to protect your walkway from the debris of customs, to sweep away the opacities of mortal nature from the carpet of your present moment, and to make the drinking place of your aspiration pure of the dust of others. Be one in heart, one in desire, and one in aspiration. 'When someone comes to have one concern, God will suffice him against the concerns of this world and the next.'\ufffd This is why He says, \ufffdand that some of us do not take others of us as lords apart from God\ufffd: Do not settle down in every street with each scatteredness of the heart. Do not obey the commanding soul, do not worship blameworthy caprice, and take not two gods; surely He is but One God [16:51].As long as the talk of some defiled fellow grabs you,you're the servant of your own fancy, not a servant of God."
