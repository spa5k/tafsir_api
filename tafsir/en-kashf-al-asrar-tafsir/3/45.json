  "text": "When the angels said, \ufffdO Mary, surely God gives thee the good news of a word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, celebrated in this world and the next, and one of those given proximity.\ufffdIn this verse the God of the universe, the enactor of the world's folk, the assigner of daily provi- sions to the servants, the bestower of bounty and the lovingly kind, the caresser of the friends, caresses Mary and honors her. With this honoring He gives her excellence over the women of the world and separates her from all of them.First, He calls her with the vocative of honor, saying \ufffdO Mary.\ufffd Exalted is this address! Exalted is this call! Thousands of thousands of prophets and friends went, either in the repose of having found it, or in remorse and hope for it. O spirit of the world! If a thousand times you call on Him saying, \ufffdMy Lord, my Lord,\ufffd that is not like His calling on you once, \ufffdMy servant, My servant.\ufffd Even if you accept Him in lordhood, that gains you nothing, for in any case His lordhood is inseparable from you. What does the work is that once He should accept you for servanthood.Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī said, \ufffdGod stood me before Him in a thousand standing places, presenting the empire to me, but I was saying, 'I do not desire it.' In the last standing place He said to me, 'O Abū Yazīd, what do you desire?' I said, 'I desire not to desire,'\ufffd that is, I desire what You desire. \ufffdThen He said, 'You are My servant in truth.'\ufffdEven if you do not have the gall to speak with God like Abū Yazīd, you are not too small to present your need to Him, to show Him your burning and hope, and to say, \ufffdO Lord, a name and mark is enough for me! You have come from Your threshold to place a name on me. Whatever name You want, let it be.\ufffdA man went to the bazaar to buy a slave. They presented the slaves to him and he chose one to buy. He said, \ufffdO slave, what's your name?\ufffd He said, \ufffdFirst buy me so that I may belong to you. Then call me by whatever name you want."
