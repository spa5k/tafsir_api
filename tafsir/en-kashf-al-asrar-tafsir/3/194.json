  "text": "Our Lord, and give us what Thou hast promised us through Thy messengers.O Lord, bring to pass the promise that You Yourself made, bring to fruit the tree that You Yourself planted, brighten the lamp that You Yourself lit, and keep the blight of us away from the love that You gave by Your own bounty. O Lord, we are happy that You were and we were not. Your work caught on and ours did not. You put forth Your own worth, You sent Your own Messenger. O Lord, You lifted us up and no one said, \ufffdLift up!\ufffd Now that You have lifted up, don't put down! Keep us in the shadow of gentleness and entrust us to none but Your bounty!If You water, You Yourself planted.If You flatten the foundation, You Yourself raised it.I the servant am just what You fancied.Don't throw me down-You lifted me up."
