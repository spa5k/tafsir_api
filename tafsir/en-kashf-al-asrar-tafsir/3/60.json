I do not need or require anyone in that. No one besides Me has the power of existence-giving and devising.\ufffdOne of the pirs of the Tariqah said in his whispered prayer, \ufffdO Lord, the one who does the work is the one who can, and the one who bestows is the one who has. What do I have and what can I do? Who has ability like Your ability? In praising You who has a tongue? Without Your love, who has the joy of spirit?\ufffdWithout the breeze of the heart-taker's love, the garden has no ease, without the radiance of that rose-colored face, there's no light or fire."
