  "text": "Do not have faith in any but those who follow your religion. Say: \ufffdSurely the guidance is God's guidance,\ufffd lest anyone should be given the like of what you have been given, or dispute with you before your Lord. Say: \ufffdSurely the bounty is in God's hand. He gives it to whomso- ever He wills.\ufffd And God is all-embracing, knowing.Some of the commentators have said that here God is addressing the Muslims and caressing the folk of recognition and faith. He is reminding them of His favor toward them with the religion of the submission. The address then has two paths. In one respect it is addressed to the common faithful of this community, and in the other respect it is addressed to the recognizers and the elect among the folk of the Tariqah.The first respect is this: \ufffdO assembly of submitters! Do not suppose or hold firm that anyone has been given what has been given to you. There is no religion like the religion of the submission, and it was given to you. There is no book like the Qur'an, and it was given to you. There is no prophet like Muá¸¤ammad, and he was given to you. There is no month like Ramadan, and it belongs to you. There is no day like Friday, and it belongs to you. All the shariahs have been abrogated by your shariah, and all the compacts have been abrogated by your compact. The perfection of the religion and the Shariah and the beauty of the Tariqah and the Haqiqah are all in your covenant.\ufffd This is in His words, \ufffdToday I have perfected your religion for you and I have completed My bless- ings upon you and I have approved the submission for you as a religion\ufffd [5:3].\ufffdNow give gratitude for this blessing, give thanks to your Object of worship, and obey the command. The command is this: 'Do not have faith in any but those who follow your religion.' Do not exercise friendship with any but those who share your religion, and do not show brother- hood to any but the faithful. Keep away from the irreligious and the estranged.\ufffd This is just what He says in this verse: \ufffdDo not lean upon those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you\ufffd [11:113]."
