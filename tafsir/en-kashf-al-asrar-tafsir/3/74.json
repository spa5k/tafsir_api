  "text": "He singles out for His mercy whomsoever He will.That is, He singles out for His blessings whomsoever He will. He singles out a group for provisions, He singles out a group for the blessing of character traits, He singles out a group for the blessing of worship, others for the blessing of desire, others for the success of outwardness, others for the realiza- tion of the secret cores, others for the gift of outer skins, others for the encounter with the secrets. God says, and His words are truth: \ufffdIf you count God's blessings, you will not enumerate them\ufffd [14:34].7 He singles out for His mercy whomsoever He will. He brought them together obscurely anddid not specify anyone so that the hopeful would increase in their hope and the fearful would not remain in their fear. In the station of worship and obedience the servants will not find any statesbetter than hope and fear, for the Lord of the Worlds praises the servants in these two states and says, \ufffdThey hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement\ufffd [17:57].He is also calling attention to the fact that even if the servants strive to the utmost in obedience and perform all the conditions of servanthood, in the end it is God's mercy that will deliver them. Concerning this the following has been narrated from the Prophet: \ufffdNo one will enter the Garden by his deeds.\ufffdIt was said to him, \ufffdNot even you, O Messenger of God!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdNot even I, unless God envelops me with His mercy.\ufffd"
