  "text": "O you who have faith, be wary of God as is the rightful due of His wariness.When He says, \ufffdO people,\ufffd He says, \ufffdBe wary of your Lord\ufffd along with it. When He says, \ufffdO youwho have faith,\ufffd He says, \ufffdBe wary of God\ufffd along with it.Be wary of your Lord is addressed to the common people. Their godwariness is based on seeing blessings, and their aspiration is nurturing the body to serve the Real. Be wary of God is addressed to the folk of caresses and generosity. Their godwariness is based on being watchful of the Beneficent and their aim is the repose of the spirit in witnessing the Real. What a difference between the two!Be wary of your Lord is addressed to the wage-earners, and Be wary of God is addressed to the recognizers. The wage-earners are seeking joy and blessings, and the recognizers are seeking the mystery of the Beneficent. From God the wage-earners want other than Him, but the recognizers want God Himself.AḤmad ibn Khiẓrūya saw the Real in a dream. He said, \ufffdO AḤmad! Everyone is seeking something from Me, except Abū Yazīd. He is seeking Me.\ufffdPeople are wishing for repose and comfort,but I, O Exalted One, wish to encounter You empty.*On the day I reach union with YouI will disdain the state of the paradise-dwellers.It has been said that godwariness is of three sorts: One is wariness of God's punishment by having patience against acts of disobedience, as He says: \ufffdBe wary of the Fire that has been prepared for the unbelievers\ufffd [3:131]. Second is the godwariness of gratitude for blessings, as He says: \ufffdBe wary of your Lord\ufffd [4:1]. Third is godwariness at the vision of Unity, without taking into account reward or punishment, as He says: \ufffdBe wary of God as is the rightful due of His wariness.\ufffd The first is the godwariness of the wrongdoers, the second the godwariness of the moderate, and the third the godwariness of the preceders."
