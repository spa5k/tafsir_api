  "text": "Let not the faithful take the disbelievers as friends instead of the faithful\ufffd. And God warns you of Himself, and God is clement to the servants.The reality of the servant's faith and the final goal of his traveling on the path of tawḤīd takes him back to God's friendship. The reality of friendship is conformity, that is, being a friend of His friend and an enemy of His enemy. The master of the Shariah alluded to this with his words, \ufffdThe most reliable handhold of faith is love in God and hate in God.\ufffdThe traditions say that the Lord of the Worlds sent a revelation to one of the former prophets: \ufffdSay to the servants, 'In this world you have taken up renunciation in order to hurry to your own comfort and be relieved of this world's suffering. With your obedience and worship you have sought your own exaltation and your own good name. Now look: What have you done for Me? Have you ever loved My friends? Have you ever taken My enemies as your enemies?\ufffdThis is exactly what He said to Jesus: \ufffdO Jesus, if the worship of all the inhabitants of heaven and earth accompanies you in the path of the religion, but you have no love for My friends and no enmity for My enemies, then your worship has been useless and without profit.\ufffdIt is reported that Abū Idrīs Khawlānī said to Muʿādh, \ufffdI love you in the path of God.\ufffd Muʿādh said, \ufffdLet it be good news! I heard God's Messenger say that on the Day of Resurrec-tion, God will place seats around the Splendorous Throne for a group whose faces will be like the full moon. Everyone will be fearful because of the awe of the resurrection, but they will be secure. Everyone will be in dread, but they will be still. It was said, 'O Messenger of God! Which group is this?'\ufffdHe said, 'Those who love each other in God.'\ufffdIt has also been related that God says, \ufffdI have obligated My love on those who love each other in Me, sit with each other in Me, visit each other in Me, and spend freely on each other in Me.\ufffdMujāhid said, \ufffdWhen God's friends smile in each other's faces, their sins fall away like leaves from a tree."
