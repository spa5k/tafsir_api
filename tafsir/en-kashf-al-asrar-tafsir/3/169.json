  "text": "Count not those who were killed in God's path as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, provided for.O life of the spirit, what is it with me that I know nothing of my state? The spirit from You fills me, but my heart's blood is empty of You.O God, our life lies in remembering You, our happiness in finding You, our spirit in recognizing You!The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdThe living are three: one lives through the spirit, one lives through knowledge, and one lives through the Real. He who lives through the spirit lives on food and wind. He who lives through knowledge lives on love and remembrance. He who lives through the Real is happy indeed with Him.\ufffdO God, if the body's spirit is deprived of You, it will be a captive corpse, but if someone is killed in Your path hoping for union with You, he will live forever.\ufffdYou said, \ufffdDon't pass by my street drunklest you be killed, for my suitor is jealous.\ufffdLet me say a word, my dear, perhaps I'll be excused- \ufffdKilled in your street is better than far from your face.\ufffdIndeed, when friends are wounded in the Friend's street, that is a good omen, for gambling away the spirit in the gaming-house of passion is their habit and disposition.Wealth, gold, things-gamble them away for nothing. When the work reaches your spirit, gamble it away!Beware, beware! Take care not worry that your spirit will perish in the Friend's path. When the spirit perishes in loyalty to the Friend, that is true eminence. The precondition for your spirit's undertaking friendship's rightful due is its destruction.Love is intoxication, its craving destruction, its wilting and emaciation beautiful.He has clothed me with abasement in His love- abasement in love for the likes of Him is eminence.That tumultuous one of the time, ShiblÄ«, said, \ufffdWhen someone is destroyed in God, God takes his place.\ufffd When you are loyal in friendship and gamble away your spirit, you will receive good fortune for free, for you will have the Friend in place of the spirit. If you had a hundred thou- sand spirits, you should sacrifice them to this union, for in truth that would still be something for nothing."
