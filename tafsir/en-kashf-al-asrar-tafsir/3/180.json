The incumbent in wealth is a little bit of a lot, so a man gives the poor a little and keeps a lot for himself.But in the language of the Tariqah and the folk of allusion, niggardliness is leaving a little for oneself, a tiny amount of property, or a moment of the state. \ufffdThe ransomed slave stays a slave so long as a dirham is owed.\ufffd Wealth and states in the path of these chivalrous men have the form of a dog, and passion in its own world has the form of an angel. MuṣṬafā's Shariah reports that the angel gets along badly with the dog and never descends into a house that has one. \ufffdNo angel enters the house within which there is a dog or pictures.\ufffdWhen will the angel come forth if you do nottake the dog from the door and the painting from the wall?When will you arrive at AḤmad and Abū Bakr,with a spider spinning its web at the door of the cave?Lift up the veil so that down may comea litter of magnificence to the bench of the threshold. [DS 200]"
