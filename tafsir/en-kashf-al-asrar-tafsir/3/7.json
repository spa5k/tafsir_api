  "text": "He it is who has sent down upon thee the Book, wherein are firm verses, which are the mother of the Book, and others ambiguous.He is neither a name nor an attribute. Rather, it is an allusion to being. It means that our Lord is, He is fitting to be, and He has been-beyond location and transcendent in attributes. ShurayḤ ʿābid said, \ufffdI saw a dervish in the mosque of the Sanctuary calling upon God by saying, 'O He who is He! O He other than whom there is no he! Forgive me.' A voice came from the Unseen: 'O dervish, you received so much reward for saying that the first time that the angels will be writ- ing it out until the resurrection.'\ufffdHuwa is two letters, h and w. The place of articulation of h is the last part of the throat, and the place of articulation of the w is the first part of the throat. This alludes to the fact that the letters begin from Him at first and return to Him at last. From Him they begin and to Him they return. It has also been said it alludes to the created things and engendered beings: all things come in the beginning from His power and return in the end by His decree.A dervish in the state of rapture was asked, \ufffdWhat is your name?\ufffd He answered, \ufffdHe.\ufffd They said, \ufffdWhere have you come from?\ufffd He said, \ufffdHe.\ufffd They said, \ufffdWhat do you want?\ufffd He said, \ufffdHe.\ufffd They said, \ufffdPerhaps you mean 'God'.\ufffd When the dervish heard the name God, he gave his spirit to the name and left this world.The painters depict Your name in a hundred meanings; remembering You and Your name they give up their spirits.They scatter their lives for the scent of union with Youwith nothing in hand of Your description but incapacity.Wherein are firm verses, which are the mother of the Book, and others ambiguous. These are the two great divisions of the Qur'an, one apparent and clear, the other abstruse and difficult. The ap- parent belongs to the majesty of the Shariah, and the difficult belongs to the beauty of the Haqiqah. The apparent is so the common people may reach joy and blessings by perceiving it and putting it into practice."
