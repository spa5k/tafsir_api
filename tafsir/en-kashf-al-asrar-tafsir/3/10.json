  "text": "As for the unbelievers, their possessions will not take away their need for God, neither their children, and it is they who will be fuel for the Fire.What a majestic God, generous, lovingly kind, who promises the faithful in the midst of warning the unbelievers and who caresses these while blaming those! He is saying, \ufffdTomorrow at the res- urrection possessions and children will be useless to the unbelievers and will not profit them.\ufffd In other words, they will be useful to the faithful whenever they have carried out what is rightfully due to them, making them the snare of their own religion and seeking through them their endless felicity.MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdHow excellent are wholesome possessions for the wholesome man! What ex- cellent assistance are possessions for being wary of God!\ufffd This is just what the Lord of the Worlds says: \ufffdAnd, with what God has given thee, follow after the Last Abode\ufffd [28:77]. He is saying, \ufffdIn that of this world which He has given you, bring the next world to hand! Seek the felicity of the next world!\ufffd The felicity of the next world lies in recognition of God. Recognition comes from the light of the heart. The light of the heart comes from the lamp of tawḤīd, and the root of this lamp is the divine bestowal. As for its material, that comes from the deeds and obedient acts of the body. Obedient acts come from the strength of the soul, and the soul's strength comes from food, drink, and clothing. Food, drink, and clothing are nothing but possessions. Hence possessions, by this series of steps, are the cause of endless felicity. But, one must not pass beyond the measure of sufficiency, for then these will become the cause of rebellion, just as He says: \ufffdNo indeed; surely man is rebellious because he sees himself without needs\ufffd [96:6-7]. This is why God's Messenger supplicated, \ufffdLord God, make the food of Muhammad's family in the measure of sufficiency!\ufffd When the measure of sufficiency is for the leisure to worship, then it itself is nothing but worship, for it is the supplies for the road, and the road supplies are also part of the road.Shaykh Abu'l-Qāsim Kurragānī had a lawful landed estate from which he received his suffi- ciency."
