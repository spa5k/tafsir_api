  "text": "Say: If you love God, follow me; God will love you and forgive you your sins.In terms of the Haqiqah this verse has another intimation and another taste. He is saying: \ufffdWho- ever has fervor in his breast because of these words, say to him: 'Come out in my tracks, for all the work has been made ready in my footsteps. Do not bind your heart to intellect, for intellect is a watchman, not a leader to whom the reins should be given. It is not a road that you should set out in. Do not seek what you are seeking from intellect, seek it from prophethood. Intellect carries the saddle-cloth of the religion's ruling. The exalted magnificence of the religion does not fit into thescales of intellect, nor does it come under the confines of substance and accident.'\ufffdOur religion is the same as the religion of the 124,000 prophets and messengers. The testi- mony of the Qur'an contains these words, for He says, \ufffdHe has set down for you as the religion that with which He counseled Noah\ufffd and so on [42:13].That which holds up the level of our religion is two things: \ufffdGod said\ufffd and \ufffdGod's Messenger said.\ufffd If everything that is the basis of the religion of the innovators-the substances, accidents, and specific differences of the Kalam experts and the determinations of their intellects-suddenly ceased to be in creation, came to nothing, and entered into the concealment of nonexistence, not an iota of deficiency would reach the threshold of the religion's exaltedness or the gate of the Sun- nah's tremendousness. By the decree of good fortune this address has come from the Exalted Lord to the folk of the Sunnah: \ufffdToday I have perfected your religion for you and I have completed My blessings upon you\ufffd [5:3]. Here there is no room for the Kalam of the theologians and the med- dling of the philosophizers, nor for their explanations of substance and accident.The path of Kalam is the path of shadows,and the worst shadows are the shadows of Kalam.You should take the road of the folk of Hadith- it is enough to have MuṣṬafā as imam.Put away confusion, for this is \ufffdthe religion of old women.\ufffd You should have that, and the religion of servants."
