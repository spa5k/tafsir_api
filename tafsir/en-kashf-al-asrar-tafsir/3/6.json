  "text": "He it is who forms you in the wombs as He wills.Talk of this has two sides: the affirmation of the form of the Creator, and the explication of His power over creatures and favor toward them through predetermination and form-giving.As for affirming the form of the Creator, in a sound report MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdGod created Adam in His form, and his height was sixty cubits.\ufffd It has also been narrated as, \ufffdin the form of His face.\ufffd The folk of interpretation-the foundation of whose religion is adulteration, interpretation, and negation-have turned the referent of the pronoun away from the Real and rejected the out- wardness. The folk of the Sunnah-the foundation of whose religion is hearing, accepting, and surrendering-have left aside interpretation and gone by the outwardness. They say that in this report the pronoun refers to God, that investigation, reflection, and interpretation are not allowed,and that fancying similarity is an error, for the Real is without peer in all attributes.Concerning vision there are many reports that the Real has a shining face and form. Ibn ʿAbbās narrates that MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdI saw my Lord in the most beautiful form.\ufffd In the narrative of Abū Umāma Bāhilī, MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdMy Lord was shown to me in the most beautiful form. He said, 'O MuḤammad!' I said, 'Here I am, obeying Thee.' About what are the Higher Plenum disput- ing?\ufffd This report is a long one and will be discussed in its place, God willing.The narrative of Jābir ibn Samura is this: \ufffdSurely God disclosed Himself to me in the most beautiful form.\ufffdThe narrative of Anas is this: \ufffdMy Lord came to me in the most beautiful form.\ufffd Anas also said, \ufffdAmong the favors God will bestow on Adam on the Day of Resurrection is that He will say, 'Did I not bestow upon you My form?\ufffdIbn ʿAbbās said, \ufffdMoses was angry with the Children of Israel, so when he came down with interdiction, he said to them, 'Drink this, you donkeys!' God said to him, 'Do you liken creatures whom I created in My form to donkeys?'\ufffdIt is well known that in the reports of the resurrection MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdGod will come to them in other than the form in which they recognize Him."
