They brought immense unbe- lief and applied their heads to rebellion and misguidance. Then He took them little by little from whence they did not know.\ufffdIt has come in the traditions that someone tormented Abū Dardā. Abū Dardā said, \ufffdLord God, bestow upon him a healthy body, long life, and great wealth!\ufffd An intelligent man who ponders these words will know that this is the worst of supplications. When anyone is given this, recklessness and heedlessness will make him heedless of the next world so that he will be de- stroyed."
