  "text": "Everything is perishing but His face; to Him belongs the decree, and to Him you will be returned.Whatever was not, then came to be, is under the sway of disappearance and the blow of annihila- tion. Yesterday it was not and tomorrow it will not be. But in the Essence and attributes of self- sufficiency the Unity's majesty subsists and lasts. He is alive before all the living, the Lord of life and the living, inheritor of the world and the world's folk, subsistent after the world's folk and the world-the return of everything and all creatures is to Him everlastingly.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, O knower of everything, maker of every work, and keeper of all, no one is Your partner and none are without need for You. You throw down the work with wisdom, you act with gentleness. There is neither injustice nor games. O God, the servant knows nothing of the whyness of Your work, and no one rules over You. You have made the suitable things and have wanted the riches. Not from anyone to You, not from You to anyone-all is from You in You, all is You, and that's it.\ufffd\ufffdIs not everything but God unreal?\ufffd God, and that's it-attachments cut, causes dissolved, traces nullified, creatures negated, and the one Real subsisting in His rightful due."
