  "text": "That is the abode of the next world-We appoint it for those who do not desire elevation in the earth, nor corruption.Tomorrow in the house of the afterworld, those residing in the seat of truthfulness [54:55] and those in proximity with the All-Compelling Presence will be a group who in this world did not seek to be higher and greater than others. Here they considered themselves lesser and smaller than oth- ers and never looked upon themselves with the eye of approval. Thus that chevalier of the Tariqah was returning from the halting place of Arafat. It was said to him, \ufffdHow did you see the folk of the standing place?\ufffdHe replied, \ufffdI saw a people whom I would have hoped, had it not been for the fact that I was among them, God would forgive.\ufffdO chevalier! Do not look at yourself with the eye of approval! Do not go into the road of \ufffdI,\ufffd for no one has ever seen any benefit from I-ness. What happened to Iblis happened because of I- ness, for he said, \ufffdI am better\ufffd [38:76].One of the great ones of the religion saw Iblis. He said, \ufffdGive me some advice.\ufffd He said, \ufffdDo not say I, lest you become like me.\ufffdThis indeed is the road of the wayfarers on the Tariqah and the chevaliers of the Haqiqah. Nonetheless, it is not permissible to throw away I-ness in the road of the Shariah, because things in the Shariah have been turned over to you, and that continues.Shaykh Abū ʿAbdallāh Khafīf said, \ufffdThrowing away I-ness in the Shariah is heresy, and af- firming I-ness in the Haqiqah is associationism. When you are in the station of the Shariah, say I. When you are on the road of the Haqiqah, say He. Indeed, all is He. The Shariah is the acts, the Haqiqah the states. The acts abide through you, the states are arranged by Him.\ufffd"
