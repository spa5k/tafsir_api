  "text": "Guide us on the straight path.This is the wellspring of worship and the marrow of obedience. It is the supplication, asking, pleading, and imploring of the faithful. It is seeking straightness and firm fixity in the religion. It means: \ufffdLead us to this path, make us travel upon it, and make us firm in it.\ufffdThe faithful are saying, \ufffdO God, show us Your road, then make us go forth on the road, then take us from traveling to being pulled.\ufffd These are the three great roots: first showing, then travel- ing, then being pulled.Showing is what the Exalted Lord says in \ufffdHe it is who shows you His signs\ufffd [40:13]. Travel- ing is what He says in \ufffdYou shall surely ride stage after stage\ufffd [84:19]. Being pulled is what He says in \ufffdWe brought him near as a confidant\ufffd [19:52].MuṣṬafā asked God for showing. He said, \ufffdO God, show us things as they are.\ufffd About travel- ing he said, \ufffdTravel! The solitary will be the preceders.\ufffd About being pulled he said, \ufffdOne attrac- tion of the Real is equivalent to all the deeds of jinn and men.\ufffdIn this verse, the faithful ask for all three of these from God, for not everyone who sees the road travels the road, and not everyone who travels the road reaches the destination. Many there are who hear but do not see, many there are who see but do not recognize, and many there are who recognize but do not find.Many a prayerful shaykh has fallen from his steed!Many a tavern-goer has saddled up a lion! [DS 110]Concerning His words, \ufffdGuide us,\ufffd it has been said, \ufffdCut off our secret cores from witnessing the others, display in our hearts the dawning lights, isolate our intentions from the defilement of traces, take us beyond the way stations of seeking and inference to the courtyards of proximity and union, prevent us from taking repose in likenesses and shapes by treating us with the gentleness of finding union, and unveil to us thereby the witnessing of majesty and beauty.\ufffd"
