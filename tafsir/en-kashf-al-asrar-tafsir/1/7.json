  "text": "The path of those whom Thou hast blessed, not of those who incur wrath, nor of the misguided.It has been said that this is the road and traveling of the Companions of the Cave. The faithful want to say, \ufffdO Lord, complete for us our road without us, just as You were bountiful toward the Companions of the Cave and placed Your caress upon them. You placed them on the cushion of intimacy and You Yourself undertook to pull them. You said, 'Go into this cave and sleep well, for We have taken your sleep to be as the worship of the world's folk.' O Lord, give us a portion of that blessing and caress! Just as You with Your bounty completed their work without them, so also with Your bounty complete our work without us. For, whatever we do is to our loss, and whatever You do is the foundation of exaltedness in the two worlds.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, we cannot complete this work without You, nor do we have the gall to complete it away from You. Whenever we fancy we have arrived, we fall back in the bewilderment of our account. O Lord, where will we find again that day when You belonged to us and we were not? Until we reach that day again, we will be in the midst fire and smoke. If we find that day again in the two worlds, we will profit. If we find Your being for ourselves, we will be pleased with our own nonbeing.\ufffdIt has also been said, \ufffdThose whom Thou hast blessed with the submission and the Sunnah.\ufffd He tied the submission and the Sunnah together because, as long as the two are not joined, the ser- vant will not have the straightness of the religion. It is mentioned in the traditions that Shāfiʿī said, \ufffdI saw the Real in a dream. He said to me, 'Ask a favor of me, O son of Idrīs!' I said, 'Make me die in the submission.' God said, 'Say, \ufffdAnd in the Sunnah.\ufffd Ask for both from Me.'\ufffdThis is because there is no submission without the Sunnah, and whatever is with the Sunnah is the true religion. Hence MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThere are no words without deeds, no words and deeds without intention, and no words, deeds, and intention without hitting the mark in the Sunnah."
