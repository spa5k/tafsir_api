  "text": "O you who have faith! Have faith in God and His Messenger.Faith is two sorts, one based on proof, the other on face-to-face vision. Faith by proof is the road of inference, and faith by face-to-face vision is finding the day of union. Faith by proof is to employ the evidence of intellects, and faith by vision is to reach the degrees of arrival. In terms of allusion He is saying: \ufffdO you have acquired faith by proof, strive to acquire faith by face-to-face vision!\ufffd What is faith by face-to-face vision? Gazing with the eye of response on the Responder, gaz-ing with the eye of solitariness on the Solitary, gazing with the eye of presence on the Present, being near to God's nearness by being far from self, being present with His generosity by being absent from self. He-majestic is His majesty!-is not far from the strivers nor absent from the desirers. He says, \ufffdWe are nearer to him than the jugular vein\ufffd [50:16].The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO Lord! You are found by the souls of the chevaliers, You are present to the hearts of the rememberers. They give marks of You up close, but You are far beyond that. They fancy You from afar, but You are closer than the spirit.\ufffdLovely idol! Are you then my beloved?Now that I look close, You are my spirit.It is also said that the meaning of the verse is this: O you who have faith by assenting, have faithby realizing! You have accepted the Shariah, now accept the Haqiqah.What is the Shariah? What the Haqiqah? The Shariah is a lamp, the Haqiqah a burn. The Shariah is a bond, the Haqiqah advice. The Shariah is need, the Haqiqah joy. The Shariah is theouter pillars, the Haqiqah the inner pillars. The Shariah is not having evil, the Haqiqah is not hav- ing self. The Shariah is service based on conditions, the Haqiqah exile based on witnessing. The Shariah is by intermediaries, the Haqiqah by unveiling.The folk of the Shariah keep obedience and leave aside disobedience, the folk of the Haqiqah flee from themselves and take joy in oneness. The folk of the Shariah hope for everlastingness and subsistent bliss, the folk of the Haqiqah boldy busy themselves with the Cupbearer."
