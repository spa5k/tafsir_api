I did not create them that you should turn your face toward them and attach your heart to them, remaining with them and being held back from Me. Rather, I created them to show them to you and to adorn them for your soul. Then, when you put aside everything and bring your face to Me, I will bring all of them into your service and put them all in your hands.\ufffd This meaning is in the report, \ufffdO this world! Serve those who serve Me, and trouble those who serve you!\ufffdThe story of Sahl TustarÄ« is well known. The caliph of the day offered great wealth to him, but he did not accept anything. Someone asked him why he had not accepted. Sahl called upon God to lift the veil from the eyes of the questioner, who then looked and saw a world full of gems and pearls. Sahl said, \ufffdO chevalier! I have no need for the wealth of the caliph. The whole world is at my command. The storehouses of the earth have been offered to me, but I do not want them.\ufffdWhy do you stay in this low place like crows looking for carrion? Break the cage and fly at once like peacocks to the heights.All on the face of gold and gems is unbelief and satanity-if you have the religion's fervor, step beyond the gold. [DS 52]"
