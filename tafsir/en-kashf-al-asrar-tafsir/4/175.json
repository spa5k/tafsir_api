Then He says, \ufffdHe will guide them to Him on a straight path.\ufffd He will give them the guidance and rectitude to know that the recompense they find and the generosity they see come from God's bounty and mercy, not from their faith and holding fast. As the Prophet said, \ufffdThere is none of you who will be saved by his deeds.\ufffdThey said, \ufffdNot even you, O Messenger of God?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdNot even I-unless God envelops me with His mercy.\ufffd"
