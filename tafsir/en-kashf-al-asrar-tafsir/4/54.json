  "text": "And We gave them a tremendous kingdom.It has been said, \ufffdThe tremendous kingdom is having an overview of the secrets of the creatures,\ufffd or it is \ufffdgazing upon the secrets of the empire such that nothing is hidden.\ufffdThis is why Abū ʿUthmān Maghribī said, \ufffdWhen someone responds to the Real, the empire re- sponds to him.\ufffd In other words, when something appears to him in the empire, he is given news of it. Ibn al-Barqī was one of the great shaykhs of Egypt and possessed perspicacity. Once he became ill and was given medicine. He said, \ufffdI will not drink it, for some disaster has happened in the em- pire. Until I find out what happened, I will not drink it.\ufffd Thirteen days passed before news arrived that the Qarmatians and fallen on the Sanctuary, killed many people, and worked great destruction. Shaykh al-Islām Anṣārī said, \ufffdServanthood cannot bear more than knowing some and not knowing some, for God says, 'He does not show His unseen to anyone except someone He ap- proves as a messenger' [72:26-27]. 'And God will not inform you of the unseen' [3:179]. Godknows all-no one else.\ufffdIt has also been said that the tremendous kingdom is recognition of the tremendous King.When someone recognizes Him, he has found the kingdom of both worlds.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, who is like me in becoming worthy for this work?Enough for me is that I have the worth of Your companionship.\ufffdTell them to call me nothing but lord-that's a name suited for Your serving boy."
