  "text": "Who is more beautiful in religion than he who submits his face to God while he is abeautiful-doer and follows the creed of Abraham, an unswerving man? And God took Abraham as a bosom friend.In this verse the Lord of the Worlds, the God of the world's folk, the Enactor who knows the hid- den, praises the self-purifiers and shows that He is pleased with self-purification in deeds. The first person to dress the Kaabah of deeds in the cloak of self-purification was MuṣṬafā, who said, \ufffdDeeds are only through intentions.\ufffd Self-purification in deeds does the work of color in jewels. Just as a jewel without the cape of color is a worthless stone, so also deeds without self-purification is to knock oneself out without hitting the mark.Maʿrūf Karkhī used to beat himself with a whip and say, \ufffdO soul! Purify thyself and be de- livered!\ufffdIt has been said that knowledge is the seed, deeds are planting, and self-purification is the water. The work is done by self-purification, salvation lies in self-purification, and endless felicity lies in self-purification, but self-purification itself is exalted and does not come down just any- where, nor does it show its face to just anyone. The Exalted Lord said, \ufffdIt is one of My secrets that I deposit in the hearts of those whom I love among My servants.\ufffdThere was a worshiper among the Children of Israel. He was told that in such-and-such a place there is a tree that people worship. For the sake of God and the zeal of the religion he became angry, left his place with a mattock over his shoulder, and went to dig up the tree by its roots. Iblis went into the road with the attributes of an old man. He asked him where he was going and he replied, \ufffdTo that place to dig up the tree.\ufffdIblis said, \ufffdGo, busy yourself with your worship, for this will not done by your hand.\ufffd Iblis struggled with him and fell, and the worshiper sat on his chest. Iblis said, \ufffdLet go of me and I will speak some beautiful words to you.\ufffd He let go of him, and Iblis said, \ufffdO worshiper, God has prophets. If this tree needs to be dug up, He will command a prophet to dig it up."
