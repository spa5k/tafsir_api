  "text": "For you half of what your wives leave, if they have no children.Inheritance and worthiness to receive it are established either by means of a cause or by way of a lineage. The cause is marriage and the lineage is kinship. Marriage is the cause of love, as God says, \ufffdHe placed between you love and mercy\ufffd [30:21]. Lineage is assistance and strength, as has come in the report: \ufffdA man is many through his brothers.\ufffd When one of the relatives by lineage or one of the near ones by cause dies, that will be a wound on a person's heart and a pain in his spirit. The Lord of the Worlds places balm on the pain. After this suffering He commands consolation through the wealth of the person who passed away. Thus, just as pain came from his passing, so also balm comes from his wealth. This is the custom of the Lord with His friends: If He places suffering on them by prescribing the Law, after the suffering He makes a treasure appear with the attribute of alleviation.Shaykh al-Islām Anṣārī said, \ufffdHow should I have known that suffering is the mother of happi- ness and that beneath one disappointment lie a thousand treasures? How should I have known that hope is the courier of union and that beneath the cloud of munificence despair is impossible? How should I have known that the Lovingly Kind is so forbearing that His gentleness and loving kind- ness to the sinner are beyond reckoning? How should I have known how servant-caressing is thePossessor of Majesty and how much joy His friends have in Him? How should I have known that what I seek is in the midst of the spirit, and that the exaltation of union with Him is my opening?\ufffdIn my whole life one night at the time of dawn,the image of that comfort of the spirit came to me And asked, \ufffdHow are you, wounded one?\ufffdI said, \ufffdIn my passion for You, that is the first opening.\ufffd"
