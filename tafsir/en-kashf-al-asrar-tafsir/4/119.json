  "text": "Surely I will misguide them and fill them with wishes.When misguidance is consigned to Iblis, this is because of the secondary cause. Otherwise who is Iblis? Yes, he instills disquiet, for that is his job, and then, in the tracks of this disquieting, the Exalted Lord creates misguidance, for guidance and misguidance, felicity and wretchedness, come from God: Whomsoever God guides, he is guided, and whomsoever He misguides, you will not find for him a guiding friend [18:17]. Then He mentions the outcome, the end, the final issue, and the returning place of the two groups: About the misguided sort He says, \ufffdTheir refuge is Ge- henna\ufffd [4:121], and about the guided sort He says, \ufffdWe shall enter them into gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever and ever\ufffd [4:122]."
