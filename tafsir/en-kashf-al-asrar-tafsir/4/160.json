  "text": "And for the wrongdoing of those who are Jews, We forbade them certain good things.Embarking on prohibited things necessitates the forbidding of licit things.If you see gentleness and generosity reaching a servant, it is because he has preserved the outward of the Shariah and has wanted to show reverence to it in spirit and heart. Inevitably, he has reached the repose of whispered prayers and the gentle favors of union's gifts. In contrast, if you see harshness and severity, it is because he has looked with denial on the sanctuary of the Shariah and has put to work the religion's prohibited things in following the commanding soul. Yes, that is the way it is: When someone holds back from the outward of the Shariah, the beauty of the Haq- iqah veils its face from him. If someone disdains commands and prohibitions, what wonder if faith and recognition take their bags away from his heart?If not for the Shariah, the turning wheel would stop;if not for the religion, the Twins would quit the sky. [DS 56]"
