  "text": "O people, be wary of your Lord, who created you from one soul, created from it its mate, and scattered forth from the two many men and women. And be wary of God, whom you ask against one another, and of the wombs. Surely God is watcher over you.\ufffdO center point of human nature, O attribute of mortal nature, make godwariness your shelter and cling to it, for the life of the servants is through it and the deliverance of the travelers in it.\ufffdGodwariness is for the servant to make the commands of the Shariah into his shield so that the arrows of prohibition may not reach him. It has three levels: First, he takes refuge in the sentence of tawḤīd and avoids every associationism. Second he takes refuge in obedience and steps away from the path of disobedience. Third he takes refuge in caution and flees from ambiguity. Anyone who climbs these way stations of godwariness with truthfulness will inescapably reach deliver- ance, for the Qur'an gives this report: \ufffdGod will deliver those who were godwary in their place of security; ugliness will not touch them, neither shall they sorrow\ufffd [39:61]. In another place He says, \ufffdWhosoever is wary of God, He will appoint a way out for him and He will provide for him from whence he never reckoned [65:2-3]. Whenever someone takes hold of godwariness, We will ease for him the road of deliverance from every suffering and We will send him provision from whence he has no hope.\ufffdIt has been said that the sister of Bishr Ḥāfī went to see AḤmad Ḥanbal. She said, \ufffdO Imam of the Muslims! I work a spindle on the roof of my house. When the torch of the Tahirids passes by, it may happen that I join threads with the rays of that torch. Is this permissible or not?\ufffdAḤmad said, \ufffdFirst tell me who you are. Are you in a walkway of being able to tolerate such godwariness?\ufffdShe said, \ufffdI am the sister of Bishr Ḥāfī.\ufffdAḤmad wept and said, \ufffdGodwariness like this is permissible only in the household of Bishr Ḥāfī! It is not worthy of you, so be careful not to do it, and Bishr Ḥāfī will be happy with you. Emulate your brother so that perhaps you may be like him."
