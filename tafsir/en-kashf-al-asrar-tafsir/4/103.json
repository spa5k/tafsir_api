  "text": "When you have completed the prayer, remember God, standing and sitting and on your sides.Know that the prayer is secret whispering between God and the servant. In this secret whisper- ing, there is both need and joy. Today there is need, tomorrow joy; today suffering, tomorrow the treasure; today a heavy burden, tomorrow repose and ease [56:89]; today toil and work, tomorrow pleasure and the bazaar; today bowing and prostrating, tomorrow finding and witnessing.Part of the eminence of the prayer is that the Exalted Lord has mentioned it 102 times in the Qur'an and given it thirteen names: prayer, devotion, Qur'an, glorification, book, remembrance, bowing, prostration, praise, asking forgiveness, declaring greatness, beautiful deeds, and subsistent things.MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThe prayer is the miʿrāj of the person of faith.\ufffd He said, \ufffdThe prayer is God's banquet in the earth.\ufffdThe ulama of the past have said, \ufffdThe prayer is the throne of the desirers, the pleasure of the recognizers, the means of approach of the sinners, and the scented garden of the renunciants.\ufffdThey have also said, \ufffdThe person performing the prayer has received seven generous bestow- als: guidance, sufficiency, expiation, mercy, proximity, degree, and forgiveness.\ufffdThe first step in associationism is not to say the prayers, for the Exalted Lord will say, \ufffd'Whatbrought you into Saqar?' They will say, 'We were not of those who said the prayers'\ufffd [74:42-43].And He placed the name faith in the prayer, where He says, \ufffdBut God would never leave your faith,\ufffd that is, your prayer, \ufffdto waste\ufffd [2:143]. He promises daily provision with prayer, where He says, \ufffdAnd command thy folk to the prayer, and be thou patient therein. We ask thee for no provi- sion. We shall provide for thee\ufffd [20:132].The number of obligatory prayers came as five in conformity with the roots of the Shari'ite rules. Concerning the roots of the Shari'ite rules MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThe submission is built on five.\ufffd The roots of the obligatory prayers are five prayers in one day and night. In other words, when the servant performs these five prayers with their stipulations and at their times, the Exalted Lord will give him the reward of all the roots of the Shari'ite rules.The guises of the prayer are four: standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting."
