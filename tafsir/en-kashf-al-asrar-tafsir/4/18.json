  "text": "This turning will not belong to those who keep on doing ugly deeds until death is present for one of them, and then he says: \ufffdSurely now I have turned.\ufffdIn the tongue of learning, one must repent before death, even if it be one moment. In the tongue of practice, one must repent before the soul has the habit of seeing itself and worshiping itself. When someone is pleased with himself and gazes upon himself habitually, the door to repentance has been shut to him and the water of deliverance taken away from him.Quit being the companion of self-nurturing habit-worshipers!Kiss the dust beneath the feet of those who have disowned self! [DS 972]Not everyone who has repented in the road of the Shariah, thereby reaching pardon and forgive- ness, has reached truthfulness in love in respect of the Haqiqah. For a long time David the prophet wept and pleaded. At last it was said to him, \ufffdO David! Why do you weep when I have forgiven you, made your adversaries content, and accepted your repentance?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdLord God, I know, but give me back those sweet moments I had in Your companion- ship and those breaths I had with You in seclusion!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdDavid, take heed! That is a love that has passed.\ufffdFrom now on leave the way open for the eyes to weep for the days of limpidness have no way to return.*Oh pain, Oh regret-of that standing and sitting in prayer I have dust on the head and wind in the hand."
