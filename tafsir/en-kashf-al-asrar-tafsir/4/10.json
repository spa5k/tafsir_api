  "text": "Surely those who eat the property of orphans wrongly will be eating only fire in their bellies and will roast in a blaze.The majestic compeller, the great Lord, the renowned keeper of servants, the clement, the gener- ous, the loyal, the tremendous, the lord of everyone, the carrier of everything, who takes the hand of the weak and joins with them in love, in this verse caresses the weak and shows love to theorphans. As for those wrongdoers who skewer the livers of orphans and drink the blood of the indigent, He threatens them and warns them of a fearful punishment. He acts as the deputy of the helpless and disputes with the wrongdoers for their sake. For He is the companion of the weak, the helper of the despairing, the responder to the call of the distressed, and the listener to the voice of the grieved. He loves the servant who, when battered, incapable, and destitute, lets out a cold sigh, sheds warm tears, and lifts two empty hands toward Him, asking again to be excused.It has come in the traditions that a man was saying, \ufffdO Lord, O Lord! You have written, You have measured out, and You have decreed!\ufffd O God, all that was, is, and shall be is what You want, what You bring about, and what You write for the creatures. O God, none of this is outside Your predestination, nor does it happen without Your decree.A call came in his secret core, \ufffdThat is tawḤīd. Where is servanthood?\ufffd What you have said is nothing but tawḤīd and is fit for My Godhood. What then is the mark of your servanthood?The man said, \ufffdO Lord, O Lord! Surely I have disobeyed, I have sinned, and I ask.\ufffd O God, what comes from me is fitting for me. O God, I have broken the covenant, I have no loyalty, I am disloyal and everything worse.What can I do about this story-I'm all artifice and color. I'm altogether too lame to walk on the straight road.Greed has made me all grasping claws,I'm all war with the Apportioner's apportioning.Surely those who eat the property of orphans wrongly. It is harsh to eat the wealth of orphans and foolishly crave their possessions. They say that once the marvel of the empire, the pure Jesus, was passing by a graveyard."
