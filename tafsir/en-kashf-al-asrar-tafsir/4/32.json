  "text": "Do not wish for that whereby God has preferred some of you over others. Men shall have a portion of what they have earned, and women shall have a portion of what they have earned. But ask God of His bounty.Abū Bakr Kattānī said, \ufffdWhen someone has the opinion that he will arrive without expending ef- fort, he is a wisher, and when someone has the opinion that he will arrive by expending effort, he is a drudge.\ufffdWhoever fancies that he will reach the goal without toiling is a wisher, and \ufffdThe incapable are those who follow their own caprice and wish for God.\ufffd Whoever fancies that he will reach the Sought by toil and by seeking the Sought is a drudge.Shaykh al-Islām Anṣārī said, \ufffdHe is not found by seeking, but the seeker finds. Until he finds Him, he will not seek. Whatever can be found by seeking is of little worth. The servant finds the Real before the seeking, but for him seeking is the earliest step. The recognizer finds seeking from finding, not finding from seeking. In the same way, the obedient person finds obedience from self-purification, not self-purification from obedience; he finds the cause from the meaning, not the meaning from the cause. O God, since finding You is before the seeking and the seeker, I am seeking because unsettledness has overpowered me. The seeker is seeking and the Sought is obtained before the seeking. This is a most marvelous business! What is even more marvelous isthat finding has become hard cash when seeking has not yet arisen. The Real is seen but the curtain of exaltedness is in place.\ufffdYou are a sea of loveliness, a wave of beauty, the law of generous acts, the essence of life.The lovers seeking You are full of longing like Alexander seeking the water of life.It has also been said that the meaning of the verse is this: \ufffdYou wish for the station of the masters without traveling in their path, clinging to their conduct, and practicing their practices.\ufffd4 You want the state of the great ones, but you have not gone on the great ones' road. You search for the Kaabah of union with eyes that have not undertaken struggle. You see the great good fortune of the friends, but you have not seen their tribulation."
