  "text": "O people, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.The majestic Unity is placing a favor on the center point of mortal nature: \ufffdWe have lit two lamps for you, one in the heart, the other in front of you. The one in front of you is the lamp of the Sun- nah, which is the proof itself, and the one in the heart is the lamp of faith and the shining light. Happy is the servant who walks between these two lamps! Who is more exalted than he in whose heart the greatest light is shining and the eyes of whose heart sees the eyes and face of the Friend face-to-face! One breath with the Friend is worth the two worlds. One vision of the Friend for a hundred thousand spirits is gratis!\ufffdIn gratitude I will also send my spirit to You-a whiff of union with You does what a hundred spirits cannot."
