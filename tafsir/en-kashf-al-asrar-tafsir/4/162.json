  "text": "But those who are firmly rooted in knowledgeThe firmly rooted in knowledge are those who have obtained the varieties of knowledge: knowl- edge of the Shariah, knowledge of the Tariqah, and knowledge of the Haqiqah.Knowledge of the Shariah is to be learned, knowledge of the Tariqah is to be practiced, and knowledge of the Haqiqah is to be found. Concerning knowledge of the Shariah He says, \ufffdAsk the folk of the remembrance\ufffd [16:43]. Concerning knowledge of the Tariqah He says, \ufffdSeek the means of approach to Him\ufffd [5:35]. Concerning knowledge of the Haqiqah He says, \ufffdWe taught him knowledge from Us\ufffd [18:65]. He turned knowledge of the Shariah over to a teacher, He turned knowledge of the Tariqah over to a pir, and He turned knowledge of the Haqiqah over to Himself. Whoever fancies that he has no use for the intermediary of a teacher in knowledge of the Shari-ah is a heretic. Whoever claims that knowledge of the Tariqah is possible without a pir is a tempter.Whoever says that the teacher of knowledge of the Haqiqah is other than the Real is deluded.It has been said that those firmly rooted in knowledge are those who learn the knowledge of the Shariah and then put it into practice with self-purification to the point that they perceive the knowledge of the Haqiqah in their secret core. Thus MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdWhen someone acts on what he knows, God will bequeath him knowledge of what he does not know.\ufffd When someone does not put the knowledge of the Shariah into practice, he has wasted his knowledge, and it becomes an argument against him. When someone puts it into practice, his outward knowledge becomes an argument to his benefit, and he receives the knowledge of the Haqiqah as a gift."
