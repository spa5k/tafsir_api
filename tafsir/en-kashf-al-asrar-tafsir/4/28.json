  "text": "And man was created weak.Wherever the name \ufffdman\ufffd comes in the Qur'an, a displeasing attribute is linked to it. Thus He said, \ufffdSurely man is a great wrongdoer, ungrateful\ufffd [14:34]. \ufffdSurely man was created anxious\ufffd [70:19]. \ufffdSurely man is rebellious\ufffd [96:6]. \ufffdSurely man is ungrateful to his Lord\ufffd [100:6]. \ufffdSure- ly man is in loss\ufffd [103:2]. This is because man comes from dust, and dust is the basis of density and the root of opacity. The servant's hope is that on the day He created, He saw the faults, and then He bought along with the faults.You bought me with my faults on the first day!The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO Lord, you called me ignorant. What comes from the ignorant other than disloyalty? You called me weak. What comes from the weak other than error? O Lord, take our inability to overcome ourselves as stemming from that weakness. Take our boldness and inso- lence as stemming from that ignorance. O Lord, You lifted us up and no one said, 'Lift up!' Now that You have lifted up, don't put down! Keep us in the shadow of Your bounty!\ufffdIf You water, You Yourself planted.If you flatten the foundation, You Yourself raised it.I the servant am just what You fancied.Don't throw me down-You lifted me up."
