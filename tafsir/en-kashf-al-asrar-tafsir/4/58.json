  "text": "Surely God commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners.In this verse the lovingly kind Lord, the generous and right-knowing, the care-taker of the servants, commands His servants to give back trusts. He is saying, \ufffdReturn the trusts at your own liability to their folk.\ufffd In other words, do not intervene in them, and avoid betrayal, for after the faith and recognition of the servant, there is no attribute greater than holding in trust; and after unbelief, there is no attribute uglier than betrayal. The servant's obedience comes forth from holding in trust, and disobedience comes from betrayal. Betrayal is the basis of corruption, the beginning of every mis- fortune, and the foundation of disobedience. Holding in trust is the pillar of the religion, the per- fection of tawḤīd, and the attribute of the prophets and the angels. In the firm text of the revealed book, the Lord of the Worlds describes Gabriel by saying, \ufffdbrought down by the trustworthy spirit\ufffd [26:193]. In another place He says, \ufffdobeyed, and also trustworthy\ufffd [81:21]. He reported from the daughter of Shuʿayb that she said to her father about Moses, God's speaking companion, \ufffdO my father, hire him! Surely the best you can hire is the strong, the trustworthy\ufffd [28:26]. And in describing Joseph the sincerely truthful He says, quoting the king of Egypt, \ufffdSurely today with us thou art emplaced, trustworthy\ufffd [12:54].The trusts about which the Book and the Sunnah talk are three things: One is obedience and the religion, for the Lord of the Worlds calls them a trust. He says, \ufffdSurely We offered the Trust\ufffd[33:72]. Next are women, who are held as a trust by men. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdYou have taken them as a trust from God, and you have made their private parts lawful to you by God's word.\ufffd Third is the property you leave with someone, or the secret you tell to him, for that is a trust. The Lord of the Worlds says, \ufffdLet him who has been entrusted deliver back his trust\ufffd [2:283]. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdDeliver the trust back to the one who entrusted you.\ufffd He also said, \ufffdIf a man relates some words, pay regard, for it is his trust.\ufffdMustāfā also said, \ufffdSitting together is a trust.\ufffd In other words, when you sit with people, it must be on condition of holding in trust."
