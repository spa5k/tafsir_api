  "text": "If you desire to exchange a wife in place of another...This is the realization of generosity in the religion of friendship and the smoothing of the founda- tion of chivalry. He is saying, \ufffdDo not join the cruelty of separation with taking back livelihood, for this is not the work of the generous and it is unworthy of the chevaliers! You have put the scar of separation in the poor woman's heart, so do not cut off the hand of her expenditures! If you take back what you gave, you will place a scar on her scar.\ufffdḤasan ibn ʿAlī had a wife whom he divorced, and then he sent her plentiful wealth. He said about her, \ufffdThe tribulation of our separation is enough. I must not put upon her the suffering of neediness as well.\ufffd They say the wealth was 40,000 dirhams. The woman dumped that wealth on the ground and said, \ufffdPaltry goods from a departed lover!\ufffd"
