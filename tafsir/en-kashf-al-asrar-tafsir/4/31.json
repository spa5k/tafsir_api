  "text": "If you avoid the great sins prohibited to you, We will acquit you of your ugly deeds and admit you to a generous admitting place.The great sins of the folk of service in the path of the Shariah are what you have heard about. The great sins of the folk of companionship in the street of the Tariqah and in the tongue of allusion are another sort and have another tasting, for the folk of service are one thing, and the folk of com- panionship something else. Those who serve are the wage-earners, and the companions are the proximate. In the traditions has come the saying, \ufffdThe beautiful deeds of the pious are the ugly deeds of the proximate.\ufffd Of the same sort is the saying of the Pir of the Tariqah, \ufffdThe hypocrisy of the recognizers is better than the self-purification of the desirers.\ufffdThe basis of this rule is the subtle point MuṣṬafā reported about cloudiness and his asking for- giveness for it. He said, \ufffdMy heart becomes clouded, so I ask forgiveness from God seventy times a day.\ufffd Abū Bakr al-ṣiddīq said, \ufffdWould that I could witness that for which God's Messenger asked forgiveness.\ufffdThe mark of the recognizers' great sins is that lassitude sometimes comes over them in the world of their own traveling, and thereby their innate disposition is overpowered by human attri- butes. Their life becomes susceptible to customs and habits, and the realities of their faith come to be mixed with the contaminants of personal motives and marks giving witness to their own shares. In this state of theirs, if a messenger of sound discipline, truthful poverty, and the joy of ecstasy does not come out to welcome them and take their hands, they will not emerge from the pit of their own selfhood.If you want to come out of the pit of status like a man,grab hold of the pearl-encrusted, musk-wafting chain. [DS 719]The great ones of the religion have said that as long as a man does not reach this place of danger and leave behind the station of lassitude, he will not become a pir of the Tariqah and will not be suited to take disciples. A man must have lost the road a thousand times and then returned to it if he is to bring someone who has lost the road back to the road. What is needed first is the road to the road, then the road is needed. Someone who has always been on the road knows the road, but he does not know the road to the road. The secret of the slips of the prophets and their falling into lassitude is this. And God knows best. This is knocking at a magnificent gate. Happy is he for whom it is opened and who is guided to it!"
