  "text": "Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger-they will be with those whom God has blessed: the prophets, the sincerely truthful, the witnesses, and the wholesome. What beautiful compan- ions they!Ibn ʿAbbās says that this verse came down concerning Thawbān, who had become wasted and weak in love for God's Messenger, his back bent and his face yellow. One day the Messenger said to him, \ufffdO Thawbān, what is it with you? Has your face turned yellow because you stay awake at night?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO Messenger of God, this and that, as you know.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO Thawbān, are you placing a great deal of suffering on yourself through various sorts of discipline? You have become so weak and your back is bent over!\ufffdThawbān said, \ufffdYes, O Messenger of God, it has been something of all that.\ufffdThe Messenger said, \ufffdO Thawbān, is it that you are desiring?\ufffd Thawbān's eyes filled with tears when he heard talk of desire.How long will you ask me, \ufffdWhy are you suffering?\ufffd In truth, you know my state better than I.\ufffdO Messenger of God, I do not know how the nights pass until day comes and I see you again.\ufffd Wishing for you by day is the veil of my idleness,aching for you by night is the chamber of my wakefulness.Separation from you is the adornment of my sorrow, fervor for you is the capital of my awareness.\ufffdO Messenger of God! The hardest sorrow is that in the next world you will be in the highest of the High Chambers, and I will be held back from seeing you.\ufffdWhile they were in the midst of this came Gabriel, the messenger of the Presence, the courier of mercy, bringing a verse: \ufffdWhosoever obeys God and the Messenger-they will be with those whom God has blessed,\ufffd and so on to the end. God's Messenger recited it to him and made his heart happy, placing a balm on his woundedness. Yes, it wants a pain like this for there to appear a balm like that! Until you burn, you will not find a way out. Until you drown in Remember Me! in the ocean of remembrance, you will not reach the shore of security by the hand of I will remember you [2:152].A man with nothing will never find an accomplished friend- pain for Ishmael calls for the burn of Abraham."
