  "text": "Then they will not find in themselves any tightness from what thou decreest and will sur- render with full submission.\ufffdDo you not know that all the work has been bound to my tracks, and both houses have been at- tached to my street?\ufffd What rank and good fortune! What nobility and excellence! From the era of Adam until today, who has had such complete bounty and such well-arranged work, such celestial exaltedness and such god-like luster?After 500 and some years, the pillar of his Shariah's good fortune is flourishing, his branches blooming, his wood yielding fruit, his eminence elevated, his decree predominant. His splendor is in this world, his fame in the next. Each heart has a lamp from him, each tongue a burning brand from him, each heart a splendor from him, each head a call from him, each spirit a place for him.If you fancy that there is none of God's gentleness-there is. That above the world's beauties there is no king-there is.If you suppose that the spirits of good men in their passionhave no familiarity with the beauty of the dust of your feet-they do.And if you think that when you lift up your tresses from your cheekthe lamp of the spheres has no brightness from you-it does. [DS 821-22]"
