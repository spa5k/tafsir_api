  "text": "If you show something or hide it, surely God is knower of everything.Since you know that the Real is aware of your deeds and states, that He knows and sees both what you hide and what you show, well then, always be at His threshold. Keep your activity rectified by following knowledge, eating permitted food, and constant devotions. Discipline your words by recitation of the Qur'an, constant apology, and giving good advice. Keep your character traits pure from everything that is dust on the religion's road and blockage of the well-trodden path of the Tariqah, such as niggardliness, eye-service, rancor, avarice, and covetousness.A great man was asked, \ufffdWhat is the precondition of servanthood?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdPurity and truthfulness. Purity from every defilement, and truthfulness in every adornment.\ufffdThe defilements are niggardliness, eye-service, and craving. The adornments are generosity, trust, and contentment. The sentence, \ufffdNo god but God,\ufffd includes both statements. No god is the negation of defilement, but God is the affirmation of adornment. When the servant says \ufffdNo god,\ufffd he uproots every defilement and every veil of the road. Then the beauty of the words \ufffdbut God\ufffd shows its face and adorns the servant with the attributes of adornment. Then he is taken, adorned and trimmed, before MuṣṬafā so that he may receive him with \ufffdMy community!\ufffdIf the influence of No god does not appear to MuṣṬafā and if he does not see the beauty of the robe of but God, he will not receive him with \ufffdMy community!\ufffd Rather, he will say, \ufffdAway with you, away!\ufffd"
