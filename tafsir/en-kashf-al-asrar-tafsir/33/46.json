  "text": "O Prophet! Surely We sent thee as a witness, a good-news bringer, and a warner, inviting to God by His leave, and a light-giving lamp. “O paragon of the world! O master of the children of Adam! O pride of the Arabs and the Per-sians! O caressed by the gentleness of eternity! O foremost in earth and honored in heaven! You are a paragon whose explications are the arrangement of the necklace of salvation, whose proofs are the untying of the knots of difficulties, whose sayings are the edict of felicities, whose doings are the guidebook of generous acts, whose utterances are the capital of noble qualities, whose glances are the adornment of beautiful deeds”-upon him be the most excellent of prayers and the most ample of felicitations! Surely We sent thee with the truth [2:119]. “We, who are unique in divinity and peerless in unity, separate from creation in Essence and attributes, qualified by magnificence, creator of earth and heaven, shelter of every beggar and comfort of everyone familiar, knower of the secrets of cre- ation and witness of the deeds of all, We sent thee as a witness, a good-news bringer, and a warner. We sent you to the creatures to give news of Our gentleness to the familiar, for they are worthy of caresses, and to warn the strangers, for they are worthy of being melted. Give good news to the friends that the house of felicity has been decorated for them and warn the enemies that the prison of hell has been heated up for them.” And a light-giving lamp. “O paragon! The sun is the lamp of heaven, and you are the lamp of earth. The sun is the lamp of this world, and you are the lamp of the religion. The sun is the lamp of the spheres, and you are the lamp of the kingdom. The sun is the lamp of water and clay, and you are the lamp of spirit and heart. The sun is the lamp of this world, and you are the lamp of both this world and that world. “O Adam, though you are the chieftain in the register of the chosen and the title-page of the book of the prophets, how can you be on the same road with MuḤammad? For you were struck by the pain of the address of Fall down from it, all together [2:38], and he is celebrating the joy of who took His servant by night [17:1].  “O Noah, though you are the elder of the prophets and your prayers are answered in the prophetic covenant, how can you have the capacity to be MuḤammad's companion? You were distracted by the wound of ask Me not for that of which thou hast no knowledge [11:46], and he was taught by the gentle hand of thy Lord shall bestow upon thee so that thou shalt approve [93:5]. “O Abraham, though you are the leader of the creed and the embroidery on the robe of bosom friendship, you cannot be equal to MuḤammad, for you hid yourself with the accusation of no, it was the large one of them that did it [21:63], and he was in the rank of the sinlessness of to make him prevail over every religion [9:33]. “O Moses the speaking companion, though you are the confidant of the All-Merciful and made for the divine gentleness, how can you compete with MuḤammad? You were deprived by the blow of thou shalt not see Me [7:143], and he is intoxicated with the wine of dost thou not see thy Lord? [25:45].”"
