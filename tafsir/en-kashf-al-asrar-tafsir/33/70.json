  "text": "O you who have faith, be wary of God and speak proper words.Proper words are the words of tawḤīd. TawḤīd is the basis of the religion and the greatest pillar of the submission. The beginning of all the sciences is tawḤīd, the basis of all the recognitions is tawḤīd. The partition between enemy and friend is tawḤīd, the fixity of the seven heavens and the seven earths is through tawḤīd. The light of the two realms of being and the two worlds comes from the light of tawḤīd. The first pearl from the oyster shell of recognition is tawḤīd, the first mark of finding the Haqiqah tawḤīd.When you put tawḤīd in place, your gaze takes on the form of heedfulness, your tongue be- comes the treasury of wisdom, your hearing the oyster shell of the pearl of the Trust, your heart the center point of contemplation, your secret core the place where passion puts down its saddlebags.MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdTawḤīd is the fee to the Garden, and tawḤīd is sufficient as worship\ufffd: TawḤīdis the price of the Garden and tawḤīd suffices for all acts of worship.TawḤīd is not that you say that He is one. True tawḤīd is that you be one for Him. He-ma- jestic is His majesty-is solitary and unique. He wants the servant solitary and unique.The unique man has no use for middling passion; middling passion is not fit for the unique man.Either passion, or blame, or the road of safety-the arrow of trial has no target but man's spirit.If you are passionate, toss your shield into the ocean- otherwise, stick to the shore, or your grief will have no end."
