  "text": "Their greeting on the day they encounter Him will be \ufffdPeace.\ufffdWait until this poor man reaches the house of good fortune in the Endless. Delay and lingering will let loose the foot of compassion. The clouds of gentleness will rain down generosity, the sun of union will shine from the rising place of finding, and the eyes, heart, and spirit, all three, will gaze upon the Friend.In the report has come, \ufffdThe eyes will be filled with gazing on His face and He will speak to them as a man speaks to his sitting companion.\ufffd When an eye has seen Him, how will it busy itself with glancing at others? When a spirit has found companionship with Him, how will it make do with water and dust? When someone has become accustomed to the Exalted Presence, how will he put up with the abasement of the veil? How will the ruler of his own city spend his life in exile?In this world of exile, you become weary becauseyou must say, \ufffdGive us ease, O BilƒÅl,\ufffd for the crowd. [DS 34]Their greeting on the day they encounter Him will be \ufffdPeace.\ufffd Tomorrow this caress and rank, this endless good fortune, will be suited for someone who today is separate from the attributes of his own being. All attributes of selfhood are bonds, every bond is a color, and the chevaliers disdain every color.He who painted a thousand worlds with color-why would He buy my color or yours, O bankrupt man!Why do you paint yourself, poor wretch! Self-painting has no worth. Why do you adorn yourself? Self-adornment has no value. Let it go, so that He adorned it in your hearts [49:7] may adorn you without you. Let it go, and then He loves them, and they love Him [5:54] will approve of you without you.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdLook from Him to Him, not from self to Him, for the eyes belong to what they saw at first and the heart to the first Friend. Everyone with a chamber in this street knows that this is so. Seeing the Friend is the spirit's law and throwing away life in the Shariah of Friendship is its religion.\ufffd"
