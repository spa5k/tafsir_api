  "text": "Do they think that We aid them with possessions and children only that We may hurry good things to them?Why do the chieftains who possess this world, nurture the soul, and worship creation, having placed the mantle of pride on their shoulders and become drunk with appetite, fancy that this world is a generous gift for them, or that possessions and children are a felicity for them. No, of course not! They are not aware that when the vanguard of the army of blessings arrives, it always seeks the threshold of the estranged. It brings along the banner of wretchedness and puts down the brand of estrangement. Again, when the vanguard of the army of tribulation arrives, it always seeks the corner of the dear ones and wanders around the house of the friends. For in shape tribulation [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd] and love [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd] are companions and equals, like each other and differentiated only by the dot above and below. Otherwise, they are not separate in shape and form.God gave the miserable Pharaoh four hundred years of the well-being and blessings of this world and did not constrict him in anything. But, if for one hour he had wanted the pain and burning of Moses, He would not have given it to him, for he was not worthy of that pain's beauty. And if we suppose that someone had asked Zachariah what he wanted when the saw was placed on the crown of his head, the cries of passion would have come forth from his parts and motes saying, \ufffdI want them to saw me forever!\ufffdA report says, \ufffdWhen someone loves Us, let him put on an armor for trial, for trial comes faster to Our lovers than a flood to its resting place.\ufffdAs long as I live, I will bind my servanthood to Your cloak and put all my safety into the work of Your trials."
