  "text": "We indeed created above you seven paths and We were not heedless of creation.In the allusion of the lords of recognitions and the deduction of the folk of understanding, the seven paths allude to the seven veils that the Exalted Lord created in the Adamic makeup. With them He keeps him veiled from seeing the subtleties and finding the realities. First is the veil of intel- lect, second the veil of knowledge, third the veil of the heart, fourth the veil of the soul, fifth sense perception, sixth desire, and seventh will.Intellect keeps the Adamite occupied with this world and with governing his livelihood so that he will be held back from the Real. Knowledge pulls him into the playing field of bragging with his peers so that he will stay in the valley of boasting and vying for increase. The heart puts him into the station of courage and stout-heartedness so that he will fall into temptation in the arenas of champi- ons by craving for fame in this world, so much so that he will have no concern for his religion or its victory. The soul is itself the greatest veil and the enemy of the religion. \ufffdYour worst enemy is the soul that is between your two sides.\ufffd If you gain the upper hand over it, you will win, but otherwise, you will fall such that you will never rise again. Here \ufffdsense perception\ufffd is appetite, \ufffddesire\ufffd is dis- obedience, and \ufffdwill\ufffd is lassitude. Appetite and disobedience are the veil of the common people, and lassitude is the veil that keeps the elect of the Presence from the road of the Reality.Any talk that keeps you back from the road-let it be unbelief or faith.Any picture that holds you back from the Friend-let it be ugly or beautiful. [DS 51]He mentioned these seven veils. Then, after that, He said, \ufffdAnd We were not heedless of creation. Despite all these veils before the servant, We do not put him aside, nor are We heedless of him.\ufffd With the first part of the verse He threatens the servant with His severity and justice, and at the end He makes him hope for His bounty and generosity. The traveling of the wayfarers is built on this rule: first fear, then hope."
