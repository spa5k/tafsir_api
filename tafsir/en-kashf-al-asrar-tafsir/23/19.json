God says, \ufffdWe shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls\ufffd [41:53]. If the springtime of the common people has raining clouds, the springtime of the elect has weeping eyes. If the springtime of the common people has violent thunder, the springtime of the elect has wailing and remorse. If the springtime of the common people has fiery lightning, the springtime of the elect has the light of perspicacity. In the springtime of the common people, you should open the eyes of taking heed so that you may see the roses. In the springtime of the elect, you should assign the eyes of reflection to seeing the heart.Someone saw a dervish at springtime, his head hung down, and said, \ufffdO dervish, lift up your head to see the roses!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO chevalier, hang down your head to see the heart.\ufffd"
