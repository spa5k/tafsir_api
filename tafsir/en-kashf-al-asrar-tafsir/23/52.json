Let me come out of the bonds of attachment.\ufffd He gave his property to visitors, his son to sacrifice, and his own soul to the burning fire. Then he said, \ufffdI submit to the Lord of the worlds [2:131]. Now that I have turned back from all, I have turned to You; having held back from all, I remain for You.\ufffd"
