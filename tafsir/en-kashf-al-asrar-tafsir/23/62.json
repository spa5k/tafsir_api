The practice of the folk of the Shariah is service according to the Shariah, and the attribute of the lords of the Haqiqah is exile in contemplation.The foundation of the folk of the Shariah was built with easiness. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdI was sent out with easy and indulgent unswervingness.\ufffd The weak and the folk of concessions do not have the capacity for heavy burdens. The Exalted Lord put concessions into the Shariah for their sake and set aside heavy burdens: We burden no soul save to its capacity. This is the same as saying, \ufffdHe placed no hardship upon you in the religion [22:78]. God desires for you ease and does not desire for you hardship [2:185].\ufffdAs for the traveling of the lords of the Haqiqah, God founded that on discipline and difficulty. They are addressed by the words, \ufffdStruggle in God as is the rightful due of His struggle [22:78]. Be wary of God as is the rightful due of His wariness [3:102]. Whether you show what is within your souls or you hide it, God will bring you to account for it [2:284].\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah was asked about Sufism. He said, \ufffdIt is nothing but throwing away the spirit; otherwise, do not busy yourself with the nonsense of the claimants.\ufffdAl-Jurayrī said, \ufffdGod does not burden the servants with recognizing Him in His measure; He only burdens them in their measure, for He says, 'We burden no soul save to its capacity.' Were He to burden them in His measure, they would be ignorant of Him and would not recognize Him, for no one but He recognizes His measure and no one other than He recognizes Him in reality.\ufffd God burdened the servants with recognizing Him in the measure of their obedience and the extent of their ability, not in the measure of His majesty and exaltedness. Everyone can know Him in his own measure, but only He knows and recognizes how He is in Himself. God says, \ufffdThey encom- pass Him not in knowledge [20:110]. The All-Merciful."
