  "text": "And remember thy Lord in thyself.The rememberers are three men: One remembers with the tongue while the heart is unaware. Another remembers with both tongue and heart, but his work is in danger, as has been said, \" The self-purifiers are in grave danger. \" Still another is silent with the tongue but his heart is drowned in Him.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" O God, how can I remember, for I myself am all remembrance? I have given the harvest of my marks to the wind. How can I remember Him whom I have not for- gotten? O remembrance of the spirits, remembered by the hearts, and mentioned by the tongues! Remember me with Your bounty and make me happy with gentle remembrance! \""
