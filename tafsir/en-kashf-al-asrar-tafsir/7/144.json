  "text": "O Moses, surely I have chosen thee over the people through My messages and My speak- ing. So take what I have given thee, and be one of the thankful. “O Moses, I have held you back from one thing, and that is vision, but I have specified you for many virtues. I have chosen you for messengerhood and I have honored you with eminence of state. Give thanks for all this and recognize these blessings. And be one of the thankful, and do not expose yourself to the station of complaint.” In this meaning has been sung, If they turn away, they are the ones who came in tenderness. How loyal they were, so be patient with them if they break off."
