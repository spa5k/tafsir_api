We have turned to Thee.In other words, \ufffdWe have turned toward Thy religion and we have come home to Thee entirely, without leaving anything for ourselves.\ufffdO Lord, we have come back to You entirely. We are quit of our own power and strength. We are content with whatever You have decreed. Do not turn us over to ourselves, and lift up our we- ness from before us. This is the same as what MuṣṬafā said: \ufffdEntrust me not to myself for the blink of an eye, or even less than that.\ufffd He also said, \ufffdShield me as a son is shielded!\ufffdRevelation came to David: \ufffdO David, what do My friends have to do with the sorrow of this world? This world's sorrow will take the sweetness of whispered prayer from their hearts. I love My friends to be spiritual, not to grieve for anything, to detach their hearts from this world, to throw all their work and business to Me, and to approve of My decree.\ufffdGod's Messenger said, \ufffdApproval of the decree is God's greatest gate.\ufffdThere was a worshiper among the Children of Israel who had spent long days in worship. It was shown to him in a dream that in paradise his close friend would be so-and-so. He set off in search of that person to see what his worship was. He saw that he had neither prayer at night nor fasting by daytime, only the obligatory acts. He said, \ufffdTell me what you do.\ufffdHe replied, \ufffdI have never done much worship outside of what you have seen. But I do have one trait. When I am in trial or illness, I do not want to be well. If I am in the sun, I do not want to be in the shade. Whatever God decrees, I approve of that, and I do not add my want to God's want.\ufffdThe worshiper said, \ufffdThat is what has conveyed you to this way station.\ufffd"
