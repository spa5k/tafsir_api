  "text": "He threw down the Tablets.... He said, \ufffdMy Lord, forgive me and my brother.\ufffdIn this there is an allusion that the servant must ask forgiveness in all states and realize that it is His to chastise the innocent, for all of creation is owned by him, and the owner's determination perme- ates what He owns.The Children of Israel sinned, and Moses and his brother apologized and asked forgiveness. This is the path of the chevaliers and the road of the Sufis: They also place the sin upon themselves and apologize for sins not committed.When we are ill, we come to You, we visit you. They sin, so we come to You and apologize."
