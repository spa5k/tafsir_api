  "text": "When Moses came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \ufffdShow me, that I may gaze upon Thee.\ufffd He said, \ufffdThou shalt not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it stays firm in its place, thou shalt see Me.\ufffd Then, when his Lord disclosed Himself to the moun- tain, He made it crumble to dust, and Moses fell down thunderstruck. When he recovered he said, \ufffdGlory be to Thee! I repent to Thee!\ufffdMoses had two journeys: one was the journey of seeking, the other the journey of revelry. The journey of seeking was the night of the fire, as in His words, \ufffdHe observed a fire on the side of the Mount\ufffd [28:29]. The journey of revelry was this one: When Moses came to Our appointed time.Moses came, having become selfless to self, lost to himself in his own secret core. He had drunk the wine of love from the cup of holiness, so the pain of this talk's yearning was pressing into him and the wave of Show me was billowing up from the ocean of his passion. He wandered around the neighborhoods of the Children of Israel and gathered the words of their messages and goals so that he could draw out his words when he arrived at the Presence.I consider it unlawful to talk with others- whenever I talk with You, I draw out my words.When he reached the presence of whispered prayer, he was drunk with the wine of yearning and burnt by listening to the Real's Speech. He forgot everything, and the hard cash of his state ap- peared like this: \ufffdShow me, that I may gaze upon Thee!\ufffdThe angels threw the stones of blame at his desire: \ufffdO child of menstruating women! Do you hope to see the Exalted Lord? What does dust have to do with the Lord of lords?\ufffd How can a being made of dust and water talk to Eternity? How can someone who was not, then was, be worthy of seeking union with Him who always was and always will be?In drunkenness and selflessness Moses answered with the tongue of solitariness: \ufffdAccept my excuses, for I did not fall here by myself. First He wanted me-I did not want. I saw the Friend at my pillow when I woke up from sleep."
