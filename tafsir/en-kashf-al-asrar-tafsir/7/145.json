I shall show you the abode of the ungodly.\ufffdIt has been mentioned in the traditions that one of the admonitions that the Exalted Lord wrote in the tablets for Moses and gave to him was this: \ufffdO Moses, if you want to be respected at the threshold of My exaltation and be specified for My nearness and proximity, act beautifully toward orphans and do not abase the poor. O Moses, I am the caresser and well-wisher of orphans, and the lovingly kind and bestower of bounty on the poor. Caress those whom I caress, and do not drive away those whom I call.\ufffdMuṣṬafā said about the poor, \ufffdThe poor who remain patient will be the sitting companions of God on the Day of Resurrection.\ufffd Concerning the orphans he said, \ufffdWhen an orphan weeps, the Throne of the All-Merciful trembles at his weeping, so God says, 'If someone makes him approv- ing, I will make that person approving.'\ufffd\ufffdO Moses, if you want Me to brag about you among the angels, be without harm and keep stones and thorns away from the road of the submitted.\ufffd[MuṣṬafā said,] \ufffdFaith has seventy-some branches, the highest of which is 'There is no god but God,' and the least of which is removal of harm from the road.\ufffd\ufffdO Moses, if you want Me to answer your supplications, deal with people beautifully, learn knowledge, and teach others knowledge, for I have honored the knowers by giving them knowl- edge. For them I make the dust sweet, I illuminate and expand their graves, and tomorrow I will muster them among the troops of the prophets.\ufffdMuṣṬafā said, \ufffdDo you know what Gabriel said to me? He said, 'O MuḤammad, do not count as lowly a servant whom God has given knowledge, for God did not count him as lowly when He gave him knowledge. Surely God will gather the knowers in one place and say to them, 'I havedeposited My knowledge with you only because of a good that I desired for you. I forgive you for what has come forth from you."
