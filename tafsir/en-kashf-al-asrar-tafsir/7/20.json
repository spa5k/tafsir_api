  "text": "Then Satan whispered to them to show them their shameful parts that were hidden from them.This also is a mark of solicitude and a proof of generosity, for they sinned, but He turned it over to Satan's whispering. Then He increased the solicitude. He said, \ufffdto show them their shameful parts that were hidden from them.\ufffd He said: \ufffdHe made their pudenda appear to them, but not to others.\ufffdThey say that afterwards, Adam and Iblis met. Adam said, \ufffdYou wretch! Do you know what you did to me and what dust you stirred up in my road?\ufffdIblis said, \ufffdO Adam, I take it that I took you from the road. Tell me then, who took me from the road?\ufffdThey also say that both of them turned away from the command, but there is a difference be- tween the two. Adam slipped because of appetite, and Iblis slipped because of pride. Being pride- ful is worse than satisfying appetite. When a sin arises from appetite, there is room for pardon. When a sin arises from pride, faith gets lost in it. The report has come, \ufffdMagnificence is My cloak and tremendousness My shawl-if anyone contends with Me in either, I will smash him.\ufffd"
