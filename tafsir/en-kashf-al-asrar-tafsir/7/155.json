  "text": "And Moses chose his people, seventy men, for Our appointed time, and when the earth- quake took them, he said \ufffd \ufffdIt is naught but Thy trial. Thou misguidest thereby whomsoever Thou wilt and Thou guidest whomsoever Thou wilt. Thou art our Friend, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and Thou art the best of forgivers!\ufffdThere is a difference between the community of Moses and the community of MuḤammad. The community of Moses was chosen by Moses, for He says, \ufffdAnd Moses chose his people.\ufffd The community of MuḤammad was chosen by God, for He says, \ufffdWe chose them, with a knowledge, above the worlds\ufffd [44:32]. Then He said about those chosen by Moses, \ufffdThey said, 'Show us God openly,' and the thunderbolt took them because of their wrongdoing\ufffd [4:153]. Here He says, \ufffdThe earthquake took them.\ufffd Concerning those He Himself chose He said, \ufffdFaces that day will be radi- ant, gazing upon their Lord\ufffd [75:22-23].The want is the want of the Real, the choice the choice of the Real. God says, \ufffdAnd thy Lord creates what He wants and chooses. They have no choice\ufffd [28:68]. Moses was bold on the carpet of proximity in the station of whispered prayer. He had the attribute of realization in the state of brokenness and poverty because of anguish and bewilderment, and he showed this remorse: \ufffdIt is naught but Thy trial.\ufffd Then he perceived himself and returned to the attribute of incapacity and brokenness, entering from the door of awe and veneration. He threw the decree entirely back to the Real: \ufffdThou misguidest whom Thou wilt, and Thou guidest whom Thou wilt.\ufffd He was not content with this, so he loosed the tongue of laudation and connected it with pleading and weeping: \ufffdThou art our Friend, so forgive us and have mercy upon us.\ufffd He displayed his need and lowliness to Him and asked for mercy and forgiveness. He said, \ufffdSo forgive us and have mercy upon us, and Thou art the best of forgivers!\ufffdIt has come in the traditions that on the day of the whispered prayer, Moses reached the edge of Mount Sinai. With every step he took, he lauded God, called upon Him, and displayed a need.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdThere is no rejecting the needy, there is no deception behind the door of need, and there is no means of approach to the Friend like need."
