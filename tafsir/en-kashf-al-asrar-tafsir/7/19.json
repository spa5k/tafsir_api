  "text": "O Adam, dwell thou and thy spouse in the Garden, and eat from wheresoever you will, but come not near this tree.Adam has four names: Adam, vicegerent, mortal, and man. He was called Adam because he wascreated from the surface [adīm] of the earth, drawn from every region. Thus He said, \ufffd[We created man] from an extraction of clay\ufffd [23:12]. In other words, he was extracted from every region- sweet and briny, soft and hard. In Adam's clay were salty and sweet, coarse and soft, so the natures of his children became diverse. Among them are both sweet-tempered and bad-tempered, open and closed, generous and stingy, easy-going and difficult, black and white.Elsewhere He said, \ufffdHe created man from dried clay, like pottery\ufffd [55:14]. Pottery is dried clay that gives off sound and is full of noise. In other words, the Adamite is noisy, his head full of tumult and turmoil, attached to talking.Elsewhere He said, \ufffdfrom clinging clay\ufffd [37:11], from a clay that is sticky, clings to every- thing, and mixes with everyone.Elsewhere He said, \ufffdfrom fetid mud\ufffd [15:26], a clay that is dark and black.Thus He taught him his measure so that he would not transgress his stage. He was shown his own root so that, if he should see generosity, he would not see it from himself. He would know that eminence lies in nurture [tarbiya], not in soil [turba].What arises from soil? Wrongdoing, ignorance, and harshness. Adam disobeyed his Lord [20:121]. What arises from nurture? The generosity of guidance, the acceptance of repentance, and caresses. Surely God chose Adam [3:33]. The fruit of nurture is what He says: \ufffdHe loves them, and they love Him\ufffd [5:54].MaḤmūd went to the house of Ayāz. He saw all the property, blessings, gold, silver, jewels, multicolored silks, and robes of honor that MaḤmūd had given to him and bestowed upon him. In a corner he saw an old cloak made of patches of cloth hanging from a nail. He said, \ufffdSo, what is this?\ufffd Ayāz answered, \ufffdThis one is me in all my helplessness and abasement. All that beauty, adorn- ment, and all that exaltedness and delight are you. When I look at this, I see my own incapacity and know my own worth. When I look at that, I see you and know that it belongs to you, so I amdelighted and lift my head."
