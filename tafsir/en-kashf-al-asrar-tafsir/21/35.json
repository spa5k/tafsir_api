  "text": "We have not assigned everlastingness to any mortal before thee. If thou diest, will they be everlasting? Every soul shall taste death.When a speck of truthfulness appears in someone's heart, the reality of passion for death will show its head from his spirit, for the promise of encounter is there. What sort of spirit would forget the promise of encounter? What sort of heart would seek from someplace else the repose that comes only from contemplating the Real? \ufffdThe person of faith has no ease without encoun- tering his Lord.\ufffdO dervish, no good fortune is more precious than death. Those who have the religion place the crown of magnificence and generosity on their heads at the gate of death. Those who reap the fruit of the Shariah will find the sigil of good fortune at the door of death. Death is the sanctuary of \ufffdThere is no god but God.\ufffd Death is the doorstep of the kingdom of the resurrection and the passageway to the visitors of the Real. Death is the center of the exaltation of the recognizers, the place anticipated by the spirits of the proximate. Death is the vanguard of solicitude and the prelude to endless kind favor. In the two worlds no one has the ease that the tawḤīd-voicer has in the grave with the One. He took along with him into the dust the banner of the submission and the kettledrum of faith in the resurrection. At the resurrection he will come out of the dust with the banner of the submission and the kettledrum of faith, just as kings enter into their own city.Dāwūd ṬāÌī was one of the great jurists in outward knowledge. His truthfulness was such that on the night he left this world a call came from the middle of heaven: \ufffdO folk of the earth! Surely Dāwūd ṬāÌī has stepped forth to his Lord, and He approves of him.\ufffdOne of his disciples said that he saw Dāwūd in the throes of death in a ruined house, intense heat, fallen flat on the earth with his head on a piece of brick, reciting the Qur'an. He said to him, \ufffdO Dāwūd, what if you were to go out into the open air?\ufffd What would happen if you were kind to yourself for an hour and go out into the open air, so this heat would have less effect on you?Dāwūd said, \ufffdMy friend, I want to do that, but I am ashamed before my Lord-that I should move my feet in that in which my soul is at ease."
