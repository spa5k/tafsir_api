Say, \ufffdBring your proof.\ufffdThis alludes to true tawḤīd and the Lord's solitariness in the description of aloneness and the at- tribute of unity. The root of tawḤīd is to fly in the field of disengagement, to take up residence at His rulings through solitariness, to cut off fear and hope from both the near and the far, and to surrender the affair to God so that He may decree however He desires.Shiblī said, \ufffdThe One suffices you against all, but all will not suffice you against the One.\ufffd He is saying, \ufffdThe Real is One. If you have a thousand enemies and the Real is with you, He will suffice against all. And supposing you have a thousand friends and helpers but the Real is not with you, then nothing will be in your hand but wind.\ufffdGod's Messenger said to Abū Bakr al-ṣiddīq in the cave, \ufffdGrieve not; surely God is with us\ufffd [9:40]. It was said to a spider, \ufffdWe have concealed the paragon of the prophets and the head of the sincerely truthful in a cave. Go, prepare the corner of your incapacity and poverty in the door of that cave so that it may be their escort.\ufffd Nothing in the world is more incapable than a spider, and no house is weaker than its house. And surely the frailest of houses is the house of the spider [29:41]. When He wants to destroy an enemy like Nimrod, He destroys him with a gnat.He is a Lord who does whatever He wants and who shows His power however He wants. Take a look at His perfect power in the creation of heaven and earth, as He says:"
