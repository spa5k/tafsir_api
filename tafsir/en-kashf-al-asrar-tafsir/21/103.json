  "text": "The greatest terror shall not make them sorrow, and the angels will receive them: \ufffdThis is the day that you were promised.\ufffdOn the Day of Resurrection in the greatest gathering place and most tremendous courtyard, they will not hear from the angels the call \ufffdno good news\ufffd [25:22], nor the address, \ufffdStand apart today, O offenders!\ufffd [36:59], nor the harsh call, \ufffdSlink into it, and do not talk to Me!\ufffd [23:108]. They will not hear the call of separation's pain, nor will they despair of mercy. Rather the angels will keep on coming, company after company, and they will give the good news: \ufffdThis is the day that you were promised,\ufffd that is, \ufffdThis is the day in which you have the promised reward.\ufffd Among them are those who will be received by the angels, and among them are those who will be addressed and made known by the King. God will say, \ufffdMy servants, have you been yearning for Me?\ufffdHe will say \ufffdPeace\ufffd to a group by the intermediary of the angels, saying, \ufffdPeace be upon you! Enter the Garden for what you were doing\ufffd [16:32]. He will make another group hear without the intermediary and spokesmanship of the angels: Their greeting on the day they encounter Him will be \ufffdPeace\ufffd [33:44].He will say, \ufffd'My servants, have you been yearning for Me?' My servants, have you been wishing for Me?\ufffd This is a generosity and caress that will reach the faithful servants tomorrow at the resurrection. As for today, their hearts are as that exalted man of the road said: \ufffdThe hearts of the yearners are illuminated by God's light. When their yearning moves, the light brightens every- thing between heaven and earth. God presents them to the angels and says, 'These are those who yearn for Me. I bear witness to you that I yearn even more for them.'\ufffd He is saying, \ufffdThe hearts of the yearners are illuminated by the divine light. When the fire of their yearning brightens heaven and earth and the Throne and Footstool, the Real will declare, 'O proximate ones of the Presence! These are the yearners for My beauty and majesty. I testify to you that My yearning for them is more than their yearning for Me.'\ufffd"
