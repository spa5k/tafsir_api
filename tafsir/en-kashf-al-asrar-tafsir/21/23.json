The free-willers say, \ufffdIf we turn over all the newly arrived things to God, He would be defective.\ufffd They say, \ufffdEvil is from us and good from Him.\ufffd In the same way, the Zoroastrians say that good is from Yazdān and evil from Ahrīman. \ufffdThe free-willers are the Magi of this community.\ufffdA free-willer said to a Zoroastrian, \ufffdBecome a Muslim.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdAs long as He does not want it, how can I become a Muslim?\ufffd The free-willer said, \ufffdHe wants it, but Iblis does not.\ufffdThe Zoroastrian said, \ufffdThen I will stay with the stronger antagonist. What will I do with the weak one?\ufffdAs for the right guidance of the Sunnis, it is that the Real is the absolute owner and is able to act upon His possession as He wants. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdWere He to chastise me and the son of Mary, He would chastise us without wronging us.\ufffd Fear a God who does whatever He wants while no one has the gall to protest! \ufffdHave shame before God because of His proximity to you, and fear God because of His power over you.\ufffdKnow also that this a work that is over and done with. He has taken each to his own domicile and made his place apparent, and then He has brought him back to the beginning of the road of interaction. When the prophets came, they did not bring any new work into this world, nor did they place any new report in your breast. Rather, they put into motion what was in your breast and they called you to what had been deposited for you. We would not have been guided had God not guided us [7:43].ʿAlī was asked about the measuring out. He said, \ufffdIt is God's secret, so do not disclose it; it is a tremendous ocean, so do not importune it.\ufffd Human knowledge does not have the capacity to carry it. Man's understanding and imagination will never reach it. He does not know that the more he goes forward, the more he becomes bewildered. The more he exercises self-determination, the more he falls.What is the spirit next to Your face other than a meddler?What is intellect next to Your lips other than a fool? [DS 902]"
