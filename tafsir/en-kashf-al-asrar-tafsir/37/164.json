  "text": "None of us there is but has a known station.In the tongue of the Tariqah this verse alludes to the states of encounter and the unveilings of the masters of the Haqiqah. One is gratitude for ecstasies, another the lightning of unveiling, another the bewilderment of witnessing, another the light of proximity, another the friendship of finding, another the splendor of togetherness, and another the reality of solitariness.These are seven oceans placed at the top of tawḤīd's street. As long as the traveler in the road does not pass over these seven oceans, he will not be allowed to reach the end of the street. He must seek water from these oceans through the seven thresholds of the Qur'an, about which MuṣṬafā reported: \ufffdThe Qur'an was sent down according to seven letters, each of which is a suf- ficiency and a healing. Every verse has an outwardness and an inwardness, and each letter has a limit and an overview.\ufffdThe sincerely truthful and the wayfarers on the road have said that you must pass over these oceans to reach tawḤīd. Concerning these seven oceans, the command has come: \ufffdPass through the gate of the message brought by that paragon of the world. From every wave, take a signet from his Shariah, and from every drop, seek the help of his covenant. Then you will be worthy for the way stations of Our friends.\ufffdThis is what the Pir of the Tariqah intimated with his words, \ufffdWhen any reality sticks up its head from the recognizer's breast, it is not acceptable to the Real until two witnesses from the Shariah bear witness to its correctness.\ufffd"
