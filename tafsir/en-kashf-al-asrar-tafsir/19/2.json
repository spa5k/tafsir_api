  "text": "The mention of thy Lord's mercy to His servant Zachariah.Here you have the largesse of the Lord's mercy toward His servant. You have the utmost gentle- ness, perfection, and generosity that He shows through His loving kindness-a mercy that doubt does not reach, a gentleness that thought does not touch. This mercy is bestowed because of the divine bounty and lordly solicitude, not because of worship and the acquisitions of servanthood.As much as the servant strives in disobedience, God conceals it with His covering. As much as he strives for disgrace, He pours down His blessings upon him. This is why that pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdI reached the point where I do not count God's blessings upon me when I have so many acts of disobedience. I do not know for what I should thank Him: for the beauty of that to which He eases me or the ugliness of what He conceals.\ufffdIt has been reported that the followed verse was recited before the Messenger: \ufffdSay, 'O My servants who have been immoderate against yourselves, despair not of God's mercy. Surely God forgives the sins altogether'\ufffd [39:53]. The Messenger said, \ufffdIndeed He does, and He does not care.\ufffd Then he said three times, \ufffdMay God curse those who make people flee,\ufffd that is, those who make people despair of God's mercy.It is told that in former times a renunciant worshiped in a monastery for one hundred years, but then caprice overcame him and he acted with disobedience. He regretted that, and he wanted to go back to his devotions in the niche of worship. When he stepped into the niche, Satan came and said to him, \ufffdAre you not ashamed that you did something like that and you now come before the Majestic Presence of the Real?\ufffd He wanted to make him despair of the Real, so that his despair would add to his sins. In that state he heard a call, \ufffdMy servant, you have Me, and I have you. Say to this meddler, 'What do you have?'\ufffd"
