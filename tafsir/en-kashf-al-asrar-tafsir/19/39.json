  "text": "Warn them of the day of remorse.The Day of Remorse is the Day of Resurrection. Wretchedness preceded for one group without their having committing disobedience, and felicity for another group without their having done beautiful deeds.The Day of Remorse is the first day in the era of the Beginningless, when it was ruled and decreed that everyone would be given what was suited for him: One would be driven away without any offense, and the other caressed but not because of obedience. For one a robe of elevation was woven without bias, and the other was burned in the fire of severance without iniquity. One was full of joy on the carpet of gentleness and heard the address, \ufffdSo rejoice in your sale!\ufffd [9:111]. The other was in the pit of abandonment with the attribute of deprivation and tasted the venom of \ufffdDie in your rage!\ufffd [3:119]. Yes, He put into effect the precedent as He knew it, and He laid down the outcome as He wanted it. He brought into existence a frail arrow compounded of mortal nature and put that arrow into the bow of the beginningless knowledge, firing it at the target of the decree. If it goes straight, the laudation and bravo belong to the shooter; if it goes crooked, the criticism and curse belong to the arrow.Bewilderment upon bewilderment, thirst upon thirst-sometimes supposition becomes certainty, sometimes certainty supposition.His presence is exaltation and majesty, His carpet unneediness- a hundred thousand caravans have been waylaid in this road."
