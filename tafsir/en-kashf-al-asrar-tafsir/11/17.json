The life of the heedless is what He says: \" Whoso desires the life of this world and its adornment \" [11:15]. The life of the recognizers is And what of him who is upon a clear sign from his Lord? He is saying: The recog- nizers have the brightness of familiarity based on the light of the religion and the spirit of certainty.
