Lām: He \ufffdblames\ufffd [lawm] them for their failings and commands them to disengagement. RāÌ: He is \ufffdkind\ufffd [rifq] to them with His bounty and carries them to solitariness.Alif: He makes the creatures familiar with the blessings of the Patron of Blessings, then He calls them to the Patron of Blessings: \ufffdWhy do you delight in blessings? Desire the mystery of the Patron of Blessings. Why do you take your ease in blessings? Seek the great ease of the heart. How long will you play the dice of perishing love? Seize hold of endless union!\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, sometimes You say, 'Come close!' Sometimes You say, 'Flee!' Sometimes You command, 'Come!' Sometimes You say, 'Keep back!' O Lord, is this a mark of proximity? Is this the resurrection itself? I had never seen good news mixed with threats. O clement and lovingly kind, O gentle and good Friend, I have come to Your Threshold. If You want, keep me in joy, if You want, keep me lowly.\ufffdGod knows that I'll find nothingif I desire to replace your love.Lām. He blames them: \ufffdWatch out! Do not busy yourselves with the picture-house and the scented garden, or you will fall behind the friends and not reach them.\ufffd In the report has come, \ufffdTravel! The solitary will be the preceders.\ufffd God says, \ufffdThe preceders, the preceders-they are the proxi- mate\ufffd [56:10-11].RāÌ. This is an allusion to the deliverance [rahā] of the chevaliers from themselves, like the enraptured in the playing field of euphoria: When will they come to the end of the road? Where will they reach the shore of this drowning ocean? When will the night of their waiting come to an end? When will the dawn of good fortune appear from the horizon of felicity?The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdThe reality of this work is all need. It is an endless longing, a congenital pain. In it there are both joy and melting, both a hidden resurrection and everlasting life. It is the unsettledness of the hearts of the finders, the trial of the spirits of the proximate, the bewilderment of the knowledge of the realizers, the incinerating passion of the recognizers, the euphoric striving of the friends, and the perplexity of the chevaliers."
