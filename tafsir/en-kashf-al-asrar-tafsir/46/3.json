  "text": "We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between the two except with the rightful due.This means except for the sake of the rightful due and establishing the rightful due.\ufffdWhen I created the seven heavens and the seven earths, I brought the engendered beings and newly arrived things from nonexistence to existence. I created them so that you would recognize the rightful due of My lordhood and enactorship against yourself and you would acquiesce to My command and bow your head.\ufffdO chevalier! Doing servanthood is easy work, but being a servant is a tremendous work and a great trait. For seventy thousand years Iblis the abandoned was doing servanthood, but he was not able to be a servant for one breath. \ufffdServanthood is to abandon free choice in all apportionments that appear.\ufffd \ufffdServanthood is to abandon self-governance and to witness predetermination.\ufffdIn the flow of apportionments you must pull out the thorn of free-choice from the foot of your own work. You must wash your hands of mortal governance in the alterations of the Lordly pre- determination. You must be a praiser beneath the burden of the decree and put a stop to gratifying the soul that seeks its own share. Only then will you reach the station of servanthood. He who worships Him for his own share is the servant of the share, not of Him.Pir Bū ʿAlī Siyāh said, \ufffdIf you are asked, 'Do you want paradise, or two cycles of the prayer?,' take care not to choose paradise. Choose the two cycles of the prayer, for paradise is your portion, but the prayer is His rightful due. Whenever your portion is in the midst, even if it is a generous gift, it is permissible for it to be the ambush of deception. But performing His rightful due has no mischief or deception.\ufffdWhen Moses came to Khiẓr, he protested to him twice: once because of the rightful due of the boy, and the second time because of breaking the boat. Since his portion was not in the midst, Khiẓr was patient. But, in the third state, when his own portion appeared, he said, \ufffdIf you wanted, you could have taken a wage for it\ufffd [18:77].Khiẓr said, \ufffdThere is no way for me to be your companion: This is separation between me and you [18:78].\ufffd"
