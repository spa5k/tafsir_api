  "text": "For them is good news in the life of this world and the next world.They have two sorts of good news, one today and one tomorrow. Today: \" Give good news to those with faith that they have a footing of truthfulness with their Lord \" [10:2]. Tomorrow: \" Their Lord will give them the good news of mercy from Him, approval, and the Gardens \" [9:21]. Here you have boundless caresses, everlasting bliss, the happiness of friends, a satisfied King, and joyful ser- vants: \" My servants, whatever you seek, seek for nothing greater than My satisfaction. Whatever you reach, you will reach nothing better than My bounty. Whomever you choose in friendship, you will choose no one like Me. Whomever you see, you will see no one like Me. 'This house is your house, and I am your neighbor.' \"Great are those days whose final outcome is this! Exalted is that servant who is worthy for this! Beautiful is that seed whose fruit is this! Blessed is that night whose morning is this! A house of light, everlasting happiness, and the Forgiving Patron!Say to Our friends, \" Let your eyes be delighted- the ruined house has come to Me in safety. \""
