It is they who will be the companions of the Garden, dwelling within it forever.The companions of the Garden are one thing, the lords of companionship something else. About the companions of the Garden He says, \" And God invites to the Abode of Peace \" [10:25]. About the lords of companionship He says, \" And He guides whomsoever He will to a straight path \" [10:25]. The most beautiful, blessedness, and nearness belong to the folk of the Garden. Increase, proxim- ity, and companionship belong to the folk of recognition.I envy your house because of your neighborhood- blessed is he who becomes a neighbor of your house!God's Messenger said, \" When God settles the folk of the Garden in the Garden and the folk of the Fire in the Fire, He will send the Faithful Spirit to the folk of the Garden. He will say, 'O Folk of the Garden! Your Lord greets you and commands you to visit the courtyard of the Garden.' It is the bed of the Garden, and its soil is of musk. Its pebbles are pearls and carnelians, its trees are gold and dates, and its leaves emeralds. The folk of the Garden will go out happy and joyful. Then there will be an assembly, and therein God's generosity will alight upon them, and they will gaze on His face. It is this that was promised by God, and He fulfills it for them. \"He said, \" God will give them permission to listen to music, eat, and drink, and wear the cloth- ing of generosity. Then a caller will call out: 'O friends of God! Does anything of what your Lord promised you remain?'\" They will say, 'No. He has fulfilled what He promised us, and there remains nothing but gazing at the face of our Lord. \"He said, \" So the Lord will disclose Himself to them in veils and say, 'O Gabriel, lift My veils for My servants so that they may gaze at My face.' He will left the first veil, so they will gaze at a light from the Lord and fall prostrate before it."
