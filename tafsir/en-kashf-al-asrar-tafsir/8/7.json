How should I have known that life is in death and that what is desired by all lies in unreached desires?\ufffdLife is the life of the heart, and death the death of the soul. Until you die in yourself, you will not come to life through the Real. \ufffdDie, O friend, if you want to live!\ufffd [DS 52]. That chevalier said it beautifully:\ufffdPassion does not accept living souls,falcons do not hunt dead mice.\ufffd [DS 202]O God, when someone's life is You, how can he die? When someone's occupation is You, how can his occupation come to an end? O Found and Findable, nothing other than recognizing You is happiness, and nothing other than finding You is life. He who lives without You is imprisoned like a corpse, and he who finds companionship with You is neither of this world nor of that world."
