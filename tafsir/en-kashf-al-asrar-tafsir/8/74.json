  "text": "Those-they are the faithful in truth. Theirs is forgiveness and a generous provision.Their created nature is this: Those-they are the faithful in truth. Their reward is this: Theirs is forgiveness and a generous provision. The generous provision is that the sun of union shines forth from the east. It shines, and all of their hopes become hard cash, their increase becomes infinite, the story of water and clay is concealed, and the beginningless Friend is seen face-to-face. Both eyes and heart see through the Friend.When the light of self-disclosure appears in someone's heart,it's no great wonder that like Moses he finds comfort in the mountain."
