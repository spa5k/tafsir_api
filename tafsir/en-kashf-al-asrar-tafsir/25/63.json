  "text": "The servants of the All-Merciful are those who walk in the earth in lowliness.It has been narrated from Abū Baraza al-Aslamī that God's Messenger said, \ufffdI saw a people from my community, not yet created, who will come into being after this day and whom I love and who love me. They counsel each other, act with kindness to each other, and walk gently among the people with the light of God, in hiddenness and godwariness. They are secure from the people, and the people are secure from them because of their patience and forbearance. Their hearts are serene in the remembrance of God, their mosques flourishing with their prayers. They have mercy on their young and revere their old. They share what they own among themselves; their rich visit their poor and their strong visit their weak. They visit their ill, and they follow in funeral processions.\ufffdOne of the group said, \ufffdThey are being benevolent to their close friends.\ufffdGod's Messenger turned to him and said, \ufffdNot at all. They have no close friends. They are serving their own souls. That is nobler with God than those who are openhanded to people, because of the lowliness of this world in the Lord's view.\ufffd Then God's Messenger recited, \ufffdThe servants of the All-Merciful are those who walk in the earth in lowliness.\ufffdThe Persian of this report is this: MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdI saw,\ufffd that is, in his unveilings and visionary encounters, or in a dream, \ufffda people of my own community whose persons and semblances had not yet entered into the bonds of created nature. The compass of power had not yet turned on the circle of their existence, for today is not the time of their manifestation. That will come in other days and another time, when the desire moves and the apportionings join with their designated times. This is a people whom I love and who love me. Each of them would love to see me along with his family and possessions. They are chevaliers who always want good for each other. Whatever they have, whether possessions or position, they do not hold back from one another. They put aside their own rightful dues and shares and put forward the rightful dues of their brothers. They are leaders to the Real who travel with the light of God."
