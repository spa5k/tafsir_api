  "text": "And He it is who has sent the winds, bearing good news before His mercy. And We sent down from heaven pure water.This is an allusion to the wind of kind favor from the direction of solicitude, which blows over the hearts of the faithful to sweep away completely the rubbish of opposition and the varieties of opacity. Then the hearts will be worthy of receiving the generous arrivals from the Real. When the scent of the repose of those winds reaches the breast of the servants, they seek for increase in those influxes and search out the fragrance of those arrivals and that solicitude. In loving kindness and gentleness, the Exalted Lord opens four doors for them: The door of beautiful doing, the door of blessings, the door of obedience, and the door of love.By virtue of mortal nature the servant enters the road of his own ingratitude, for Surely man is ungrateful to his Lord [100:6], so he closes the door of beautiful doing to himself. The Real sends the messenger of generosity with the key of disregard and pardon: \ufffdI will curtain your ugly-doing with My mercy, for I am the kind Master and you are the weak servant.\ufffd That is His words, \ufffdHe it is who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the ugly deeds\ufffd [42:25].In the same way, the Exalted Lord opens the door of blessings for the servant. The servant comes forward with ingratitude, for Surely man is a clear ingrate [43:15], so he closes that door to himself with shortcoming in giving thanks. The Real sends the messenger of bounty with the key of favor and says, \ufffdThough you have fallen short in giving thanks, I do not fall short in My kind-ness.\ufffd That is His words, \ufffdIn the bounty of God, and His mercy [in that let them rejoice]\ufffd [10:58]. The third door that God opens for the servant is the door of obedience. The servant closes that door to himself with disobedience. The Real sends the messenger of forgiveness with the key of repentance: \ufffdWhen you commit a sin, I will forgive you, and I do not care.\ufffd That is His words,\ufffdSurely God forgives the sins altogether\ufffd [39:53].The fourth is the door of love, which God opens for the servant with His own bounty."
