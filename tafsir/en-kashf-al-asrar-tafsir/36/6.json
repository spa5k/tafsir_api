  "text": "That thou mayest warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless.The heedless are two. First are those who are heedless of the work of the religion and unaware of seeking for their own wholesomeness. They have applied their heads to this world and become drunk with appetite. They have shut the eyes of reflective thought and heedfulness. The result for them is as the Exalted Lord says: \ufffdThose who are heedless of Our signs, it is they whose refuge will be the Fire for what they were earning\ufffd [10:7-8]. A report has come: \ufffdI wonder at him who is heedless though he is not unheeded.\ufffdSecond are the admirable heedless. They are heedless of this world's work and of arranging their livelihood. The ruling power of the Haqiqah has gained mastery over their inwardness. They are so consumed by the unveiling of the majesty of Unity that they are absent from themselves. They have no news of this world, nor of the afterworld. With the tongue of their state they say,This world is in the hand of intellect, that world in the hand of the spirit- put the foot of your aspiration on the neck of both headmen. [DS 719]"
