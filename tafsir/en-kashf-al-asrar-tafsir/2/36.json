  "text": "Then Satan made them slip therefrom.Look at this wonder: First He caressed the servant and put all his little jobs in order, then He sent him into tumult and overthrew what He had done for him, and then He rebuked him.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, You show your friends to the enemies and You turn the poor ones over to heartache and grief. You make them ill, and then You take care of them Your- self. You make them helpless, and then You heal them Yourself.\ufffdYou made Adam out of dust, and then You acted so beautifully toward him. You placed his happiness at the top of the ledger and made him the guest in paradise. You sat him in the garden of approval, You made a compact with him not to eat the wheat, and in Your unseen knowledge You hid the fact that he would in fact eat the wheat. Then You put him in prison, and You made him weep for years. Your all-compellingness does the work of compellers, Your lordhood does the work of lords. All of Your rebukes and war are aimed at Your friends.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah was asked, \ufffdWhat do you say: Was Adam more complete in this world or in paradise?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdHe was more complete in this world, for in paradise he fell into suspicion because of himself, but in this world he fell into suspicion because of passion.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdTake care not to have the opinion that Adam was taken out of paradise because of his lowliness. It was not that. Rather, it was because of the grandeur of his aspiration. The petitioner of passion came to the door of Adam's breast and said, 'O Adam, the beauty of meaning has been unveiled, but you have stayed in the abode of peace.' Adam saw an infinite beauty, next to which the beauty of the eight paradises was nothing. His great aspiration tightened its belt and said: 'If you ever want to fall in love, you must fall in love with that.'\ufffdIf there's no escape from feeding passion to the spirit I'll suffer passion's grief for the likes of You.The command came, \ufffdAdam, now that you have stepped into the street of passion, leave paradise, for it is the house of ease."
