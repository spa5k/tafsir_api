We never remove from you any of the attributes of mortal nature without making you abide through one of the marks that give witness to the Divinity.\ufffdIn terms of allusion He is saying, \ufffdO paragon of the horizons, O messenger to jinn and men, O quintessence of predetermination, O luminous full moon, O totality of perfection, O kiblah of prosperity, O basis of bounteousness, O displayer of gentleness and majesty, O you whose branch of union is blooming and whose star of exaltedness is always shining, O you whose good fortune has gone beyond the clouds of being and become specific to the marks giving witness to the Lord- hood and the confirmation of the Divinity! Instant by instant the work of your good fortune is advancing. What others have as crowns, you have as sandals.\ufffdThe sandals that your steed threw from its feetbecame the crown of sultans-and may it ever be so! [DS 838]\ufffdO paragon! Even though the stations beyond which We make you advance are the beautiful deeds of all the friends and the limpid, they are your ugly deeds as long as you remain within them. When you pass beyond them, ask forgiveness for them!\ufffdMuṣṬafā said that he asked forgiveness for them seventy times a day: \ufffdMy heart becomes clouded, so I ask forgiveness from God seventy times a day.\ufffdAbū Bakr al-ṣiddīq said, \ufffdWould that I could witness that for which God's Messenger asked forgiveness!\ufffdConcerning His words, \ufffdWhatever verse We abrogate,\ufffd it has also been said, \ufffdThat is, the servant is not transferred from a state without being given what is above and beyond it. 'Whenever We abrogate any trace of worship, We replace it with one of the lights of servanthood. When- ever We abrogate one of the lights of servanthood, We put in its place something of the moons of servitude.'\ufffd9 So he continues, being transferred from the lower to the higher, until he falls under one of the attractions of the Real. And \ufffdOne attraction from the Real is equivalent to all the deeds of jinn and men."
