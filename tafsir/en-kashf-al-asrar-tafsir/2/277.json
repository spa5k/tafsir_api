When the dust of Our path falls on someone, the darkness of separation from Us will not fall upon him. When someone takes one step toward Us, he will find a gift with Us.\ufffd In other words, \ufffdWhen someone joins with Us, he will escape from the night attack of severance.\ufffd Or: \ufffdWhen someone binds his heart to Our generosity, he will pack his bags from the room of sor- rows.\ufffd Or: \ufffdWhen someone sees Us, his spirit will laugh. He who reaches himself will reach Us. Nothing can be said about what he who reaches himself will see and hear.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, all Your caresses are for our sake, for in each breath ap- pears so much burning with the light of Your solicitude. Who has a patron like You? Where is a friend like You? With the attributes that You have, nothing else is fitting. All this is the mark, and the celebration is tomorrow. This indeed is the message, and the robe of honor is in place.\ufffdThe robe of honor is what He said: \ufffdshall have their wage with their Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.\ufffd Wait until tomorrow, when He gives out the generous wage and tremendous caress that He has with Himself, the boundless blessings and everlasting triumph, in the assembly of repose and ease [56:89] and the appointed time of union with the Beloved.When will my luck smile at me from Your playing field?When will separation from You strike its tent from my spirit's desert?What wonderful work is the work of the poor! Gabriel, with six hundred peacock wings, could nottake one step beyond the Lote Tree along with that paragon of the world."
