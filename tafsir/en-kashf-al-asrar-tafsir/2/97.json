  "text": "Say: \ufffdWhoever is an enemy of Gabriel-he it is who sent it down upon thy heart.\ufffdMagnanimous and beautiful is the Qur'an that Gabriel brought down from the All-Merciful. It is the repose of the spirit of the friends, the healing of the hearts of the ill, a mercy to the faithful. This is why God says, \ufffdhe it is who sent it down upon thy heart.\ufffd Elsewhere He says, \ufffdBrought down by the trustworthy spirit upon thy heart\ufffd [26:193-94]. When Gabriel conveyed the pure revelation, sometimes he came in the form of a mortal man, sometimes in the form of an angel. Whenever he brought verses about permitted and forbidden and the explication of the shariahs and rulings, he would be in human form, and there was no talk of the heart. Thus He says, \ufffdHe it is who sent down upon thee the Book\ufffd [3:7]; \ufffdDoes it not suffice them that We sent down upon thee the Book?\ufffd [29:51].Then again, whenever there was talk of love, the attributes of passion, and the intimations of friendship, he would come in the form of an angel, spiritual and subtle, and he would join with MuṣṬafā's heart. He would convey the revelation of the Qur'an secretly to his secret core, and no one else was aware of him. When he returned and left behind the realm of his heart, MuṣṬafā would say, \ufffdHe broke away from me while I was aware of him.\ufffdIt is said that when he was inundated by contemplation in this speech, the revelation would first descend to his heart, for He said to him, \ufffdwho sent it down upon thy heart.\ufffd Then it would turn away from his heart to his understanding and his hearing. Then he would descend from the summitof companionship to the lowland of service for the sake of the people's shares. This is the level of the elect. It may also happen that revelation descends on the hearing of certain people first, then on their understanding, then on their hearts, advancing from the lowness of struggle to the highness of contemplation. This is the level of the wayfarers and desirers. How far apart they are!"
