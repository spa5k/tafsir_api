  "text": "O children of Israel! Remember My blessings with which I blessed you. And be loyal to My covenant; I will be loyal to your covenant. And of Me have dread.This is an allusion to the Real's gentleness, generosity, and loving kindness toward the servants. He reminds them of His favor toward them: \ufffdI am the generous Lord, the thankful, the forgiver of the servants. I have come forth with kindness despite every disloyalty, I invite the servants to praise Me despite all their offenses, and I ask them to be grateful for My blessings.\ufffd This is why He says to the children of Israel, \ufffdRemember My blessings! O children of Israel, be grateful for My blessings and recognize your duty toward Me so that you will be worthy of increase and have good name and good fortune.\ufffdThere is a great difference between the children of Israel and this community. To them He said, \ufffdRemember My blessings!\ufffd To this community He said, \ufffdRemember Me!\ufffd [2:152]. He gave them blessings and He gave this community companionship. He kept those away from Himself by the witnessing of blessings, and He kept these with Himself by stipulating love. The tongue of this state says,\ufffdI traveled to you seeking the highest things, but others traveled seeking a good life.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, the one who does the work is he who has work with You, the one who has a friend is he whose friend is the likes of You. How could he who has You in the two worlds leave You aside! The wonder is that he who has You weeps more than anyone else. He who has not found weeps at not having found-why then does he who finds also weep?\ufffdWhen the like of You is someone's friend, if he complains, that's disgraceful.And be loyal to My covenant; I will be loyal to your covenant. There are many verses like this in the Qur'an: \ufffdSupplicate Me; I will respond to you [40:60]. So remember Me; I will remember you [2:152]. My servant! Open a door so that I may open a door. Open the door of turning back so that I may open the door of good news: They turned back to God, and for them is good news [39:17]."
