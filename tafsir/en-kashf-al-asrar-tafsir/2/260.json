  "text": "When Abraham said to his Lord, \ufffdShow me how Thou givest life to the dead.\ufffd He said, \ufffdDost thou not have faith?\ufffd He said, \ufffdYes indeed, but that my heart may be serene.\ufffd... And know that God is exalted, wise.In the language of unveiling and in keeping with the tasting of the lords of the realities, this verse has another intimation and explanation. They say that Abraham was yearning for the Real's speech and burning for His address. His burning had reached the limit, the army of his patience had been put to flight, and the fire of his love was shooting up flames. He said, \ufffdO Lord, show me how you bring the dead to life.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO Abraham, dost thou not have faith? Do you not have faith that I bring the dead to life?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdI do, but my heart has been thrown into turmoil by the wish to hear Your speech and by burning passion for Your address. I want You to talk.\ufffdDost thou not have faith? \ufffdThe goal was exactly that You would talk and ease would enter my heart.\ufffdMy ease is Your messageand my feet are in Your snare.The story is told that a man had fallen for a young woman and wanted to speak with her, but she would not talk and was unwilling to do so. The afflicted man became helplessly captivated by her, hoping to speak with her. He knew that she had a liking for jewels. He went and gave everything he had for one precious gem. He went and placed a stone in front of her in order to break the gem. The object of his passion did not have the capacity to put up with breaking. She said, \ufffdPoor man, what are you doing?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdI am doing it so that you will say, 'What are you doing?'\ufffdNo rest or ease remains in my heart-call me names if you have no message.It has been said that with these words Abraham was asking for the life of the heart and the serenity of the secret core. He knew that as long as a heart is not alive, serenity will not come down into it, and as long as serenity has not come down into it, he would not have reached the final goal of the recognizers."
