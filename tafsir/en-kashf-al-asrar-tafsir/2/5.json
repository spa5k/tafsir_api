  "text": "Those are upon a guidance from their Lord.Here you have the great triumph and the worthy praise. Here you have good fortune without end and generous bounty without limit. He has opened up the door of perspicacity for them and put into effect the gaze of solicitude inside their hearts. He has lit up the lamp of guidance in their hearts so that what is unseen for others is apparent to them. What for others is a report is for them face-to-face vision. Anas ibn Mālik said that he went before ʿUthmān ʿAffān, having seen in the road a woman and considered her beautiful traits. ʿUthmān said, \ufffdOne of you who has entered in upon me has the traces of adultery appearing in his eyes.\ufffdAnas said, \ufffdIs there revelation after God's Messenger?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdNo, but there is insight, proof, and truthful perspicacity. The Prophet said, 'Be wary of the perspicacity of the man of faith, for he gazes with the light of God.'\ufffdA pir was asked what perspicacity is. He answered, \ufffdSpirits that move about in the Dominion gazing on the meanings of the unseen things. Then they speak about the secrets of the Real with the speech of contemplation, not the speech of opinion and reckoning.\ufffd In this meaning someone sang,May I be a ransom for the men dwelling in the Unseen, their secret cores roaming in all that is there!In the Unseen their secret cores crave from the Reala locus of witnessing to which the people have no access.They encounter the holy spirit in their secret cores and in meaning they remain dwelling with it.They are men who have proximity and presence in the Unseen, while their souls have been slain by their finding.Sarī SaqaṬī was Junayd's master. One day he said to Junayd, \ufffdSpeak to the people and give them advice, for it is time for you to speak.\ufffdJunayd said, \ufffdI did not see myself like that and saw no worthiness in myself. Then one night I saw MuṣṬafā in a dream, and it was the night before Friday. He said to me, 'Speak to the people!' That same night I got up and before morning went to the door of Sarī. I knocked at the door, and Sarī said, 'You will not assent to me before they tell you to do so?'\ufffdThe next day Junayd sat in the congregational mosque and news spread in the city that he was going to speak."
