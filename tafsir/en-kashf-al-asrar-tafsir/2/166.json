  "text": "When those who were followed declare themselves quit of those who followed them.The unbelievers loved idols in keeping with caprice and nature, not reality. Hence, when they see the beginnings of the chastisement at the resurrection, they will know that they have no place on which to stand and will disown the idols. As for the faithful, their friendship is the fruit of the Real's friend- ship-as He says, \ufffdHe loves them, and they love Him\ufffd [5:54]. Therefore the steep roads and trials that come to them do not bring any defect into their love, so they do not turn away from the Real.First they see the agonies of death. Then their pure spirit is snatched away from them. They are kept for many years in the dust. Then they are frightened many times at the resurrection in those diverse stations. They are rebuked while severity of many sorts is shown to them, and then they are kept for a time in hell. Despite these tribulations and trials that come into their road, at each moment they fall more into passion and expend their spirits and hearts even more in friend- ship for the Real. With the tongue of the state they say,\ufffdIf You're happy with my grief, give me grief upon grief!Away with a passion that decreases with a hundred cruelties!\ufffdThis is why He says, \ufffdThose who have faith are more intense in love for God\ufffd [2:165]."
