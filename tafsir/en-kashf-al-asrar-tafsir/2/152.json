  "text": "So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful for Me and not ungrateful toward Me.This is to remember the lovingly kind Friend, the heart's ease and the spirit's food. Remembrance is the polo-ball and familiarity with Him is the bat. Its steed is yearning and its field love. Burning for Him is the rose, and recognizing Him the garden.This remembrance makes the Real apparent. It is joined with the Haqiqah and separate from mortal nature. This remembrance is the watering place for the tree of tawḤīd, the fruit and produce of which is friendship with the Real. This is why the Lord of the Worlds said, \ufffdMy servant does not cease remembering Me, and I remembering him, until he is passionate for Me and I passionate for him.\ufffdThis is not the remembrance of the tongue that you know-this is inside the spirit. The time came when Abū Yazīd was remembering little with the tongue. When he was asked about that, he said, \ufffdI am in wonder at this remembrance of the tongue, and I am more in wonder at him who is a stranger. What would a stranger be doing in the midst? Remembrance of Him is in the midst of the spirit.\ufffdIn the story of passion for You, many are the hardships. I'm with You, but many are the stations between us.*I wonder at him who says, \ufffdI remember my Lord.\ufffd Should I forget, then remember what I forgot?That great man of his time said in a whispered prayer, \ufffdO Lord! How can I remember You when You Yourself are remembering and I am crying out from forgetfulness. You are the remembrance and the remembered, You are the help in finding Yourself.\ufffdO Lord! When someone reaches You, his sorrows are finished; when someone sees You, his spirit laughs. Who has more joy in the two worlds than he who remembers You? Who is more worthy of happiness in You than the servant?\ufffdO poor man, you are remembering yourself. What do you know about remembering Him? Not having traveled, what do you know about the way stations? Not having seen the Friend, how can you be aware of His name and mark?You are your own object of worship-you worship yourself: whatever you do, you do it for yourself."
