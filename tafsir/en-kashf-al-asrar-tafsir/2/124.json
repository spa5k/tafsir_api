  "text": "And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words.It has been narrated from al-á¸¤asan that he said, \ufffdGod tried him with the stars, the moon, and the sun, and he spoke beautiful words in that, for he knew that His Lord was constant and never ceas- ing. He tried him with the sacrifice of the son, and he was patient in that and did not fall short.\ufffd He is saying that the shining stars and brilliant sun were adorned, and Abraham was tested. \ufffdThat was so that the one tried would know, not that the one trying him was ignorant.\ufffd In other words, this was to show him what comes from him and how he was walking on the road of servanthood.Abraham came out of it extremely virtuous, fortunate, and felicitous. He said, \ufffdThis is my Lord\ufffd [6:76]. It is said that here there is an ellipsis. He means, \ufffdThey say, 'This is my Lord.' These estranged ones say that this is my God. But it is not, for this is one of the low ones, those taken down. I do not love the low ones and the taken down.\ufffdWell done Abraham! He spoke a splendid point. It rose up from the low, but he knew that the Lord is high, beyond His servants. Again, when it went down, he turned away from it and said, \ufffdI do not love the low ones, for they are not worthy of Godhood.\ufffdHere the lords of realization have voiced another intimation and have seen another subtle point. They say that from the first Abraham's dust was mixed with the water of bosom friendship, his secret core was burned with the fire of passion, his spirit was lit up with the love of eternity, and the ocean of passion was stirring up waves inside him. Then at dawn, at the moment of the morning draft of the passionate, the shouts of joy of the drunkards, and the uproar of those who have lost their hearts, he opened his eyes from the giddiness of the wine of bosom friendship and the drunkenness of passion and said, \ufffdThis is my Lord.\ufffd This is as they say:Your image has so taken my eyesthat wherever I look I fancy it's you.Both drunkenness and passion are paths of trial and the basis of trouble."
