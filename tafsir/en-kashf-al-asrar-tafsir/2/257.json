  "text": "God is the friend of those who have faith.Their friend [walī], their patron [mawlā], their ruler [wālī], and their caretaker [mutawallī]-all are alike in meaning. He is saying, \" God is the lord of the faithful, their caretaker and helper, their guide and open-hearted friend. \"In a report it has come that God's Messenger said, \" If someone were to destroy the eminent, great Kaabah, take apart its stones, and set it on fire, his disobedience would not be as much as if he were to denigrate one of God's friends. \"A nomad was present. He said, \" O Messenger of God! Who are these friends of God? \"He replied, \" All of the faithful are God's beloved friends. Have you not recited the verse, 'God is the friend of those who have faith?' \"The equal of this verse is where He says, \" That is because God is the patron of those who havefaith, and the unbelievers have no patron \" [47:11]. He is the friend and caretaker of the faithful, not only in this world, but also in the next, as He says: \" We are your friends in this world's life and in the next world \" [41:31].In the story of Joseph, He quotes his words, \" Thou art my friend in this world and the next \" [12:101]. There is a great difference between these two verses-We are your friends and Thou art my friend-though anyone who does not have the eyes to see is excused. We are your friends comes from togetherness itself, but Thou art my friend alludes to dispersion. This is not because the friend is superior to the prophet, for the end of the friend's work is but the beginning of the prophet's work. However, the weak are shown greater benevolence, and the incapable are given more caresses, for they are not so bold as to claim familiarity. They see themselves as tainted, so they do not have the tongue to speak. Whoever is more helpless is closer to the Friend. Whoever is more broken is more worthy of love: \" I am with those whose hearts are broken for Me. \"It has been reported that on the Day of Resurrection, one of the broken and burnt will be taken to the Presence."
