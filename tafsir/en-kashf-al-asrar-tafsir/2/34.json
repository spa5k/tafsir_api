  "text": "And when We said to the angels, \ufffdProstrate yourselves before Adam!\ufffdMajestic and all-compelling is the God of the world and the world's folk, the Enactor, the renowned knower of the hidden, the eternal in beautiful doing and tremendous in rank, never ignorant of what He knows, never regretful for what He bestows, never at a loss over what He has done. He is a Lord who adorns what He disapproves for some and makes ugly what He approves for others. He created the despairing Iblis from fire, gave him a place in the Lote Tree of the Final End, and sent the proximate angels of the Presence to seek knowledge from him. Despite such distinction and level, He wrote out the inscription of wretchedness for him and bound his waist with the sash of the curse. He pulled Adam up from dark dust, made the Higher Plenum the bearers of his throne, clothed him in the cape of exaltedness, placed the crown of generosity on his head, and said to the proximate angels of the Presence, \ufffdProstrate yourselves before Adam!\ufffdIt has come in the traditions that Adam was placed on a throne that had seven hundred legs, the distance of one leg to another a seven-hundred year journey. The command came: \ufffdO Gabriel, O Michael, you chiefs of the angels! Lift up Adam's throne and carry it around the heavens so that his eminence and rank may be known to those who said, 'What, wilt Thou set therein one who will work corruption therein, and shed blood?'\ufffd [2:30].Then they placed that throne before the Majestic Throne. The command came to the angels, \ufffdAll of you go to Adam's throne and prostrate yourself before Adam.\ufffd The angels came and gazed upon Adam, and they all became drunk with his beauty.A face adorned by the God of heavenhas no need for a hairdresser's touch.They saw a beauty without end, the crown of \ufffdHe created Adam in His form\ufffd on his head, the garbof \ufffdI have blown into him of My spirit\ufffd [15:29] on his body, the embroidery of the solicitude of \ufffdHe loves them, and they love Him\ufffd [5:54] on the sleeve of his sinlessness.Though we're strangers and our hearts are upset, we're serving-boys of that world-adorning face."
