  "text": "God has sealed their hearts.The seal of estrangement was placed on someone's heart, and he remained in unbelief. The seal of perplexity was placed on another's heart, and he remained in lassitude. That one was a stranger, driven away, the road lost, and this one was helpless, stuck in the road, kept back from the Friend by other than the Friend.Any talk that keeps you back from the road-let it be unbelief or faith.Any picture that holds you back from the Friend-let it be ugly or beautiful. [DS 51]Not everyone who escapes from unbelief joins with the Real, unless he has escaped from himself. Someone who escapes from unbelief reaches familiarity, but someone who escapes from himself reaches friendship. A thousand way stations stand between familiarity and friendship, and a thou- sand valleys between love and the Friend.In love for You I have never arrived at a way stationin which the mind was not bewildered at the arrival."
