  "text": "When Moses said to his people, \ufffdO my people, you have wronged your souls by taking up the calf, so kill your own souls! That is better for you with your Creator.\ufffdMoses said to his people: \ufffdTake care not to suppose that your worship of the calf has harmed the majesty of the Self-Sufficient or that it is a defect for His kingship and lordhood. Rather, the harm and bad fortune belong to you. If something bad has happened, it has happened to you by your being held back from a Lord like Him. Otherwise, He has plenty of servants like you.Sahl ʿAbdallāh Tustarī said, \ufffdGod spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, and the exaltedness of the Lord God's speech made that mountain like carnelian. Moses' turned his gaze to himself: 'Who is like me? For the God of the world and the world's folk is talking to me without intermediary, and my standing place has turned into carnelian!'\ufffdGod did not let that pass. He said, 'O Moses, look once right and left. What do you see?' \ufffdMoses looked around and saw a thousand mountains of carnelian like Mount Sinai, on eachmountain a man in the form of Moses, wearing a blanket like him, a hat on his head, a staff in hand, and talking to the Lord of the universe.\ufffd The tongue of Moses' state was saying,\ufffdI fancied that you were one body with me.How could I know that you're everyone's familiar?\ufffdA poor man was seen whispering secretly with God and saying, \ufffdO God, approve of me as your lover. If You do not approve of me as a lover, approve of me as Your servant. If You do not ap- prove of my as a servant, approve of me as Your dog.\ufffd He was saying, \ufffdO Lord, accept me for friendship. If I am not worthy of friendship, accept me for servanthood. If I am not worthy of servanthood, accept me for doghood, so that I may be the dog of Your threshold.\ufffdO Friend, if you do not give me the forefront of respect, at least keep me outside the door like the dogs.So kill your own souls! That is better for you with your Creator. By way of inwardness, this is ad- dressed to the chevaliers of the Tariqah: \ufffdCut off the heads of your souls with the sword of struggle so that you may reach Me."
