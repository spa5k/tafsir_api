  "text": "And We will indeed try you with something of fear and hunger, and decrease of wealth, souls, and fruits; and give good news to the patient.The custom of the Lord is that whenever He threatens the servant and shows harshness in a verse, then, right after that or before it, He caresses the servant and gives him hope. Thus in this verse He breaks the servant by mentioning those harsh things and varieties of trial. Then He gives good news, He caresses, and He says, \ufffdand give good news to the patient.\ufffd And, at the beginning of these verses He says, \ufffdSurely God is with the patient\ufffd [2:153]. Glory be to Him! How gentle and how merciful He is to His servants!And We will indeed try you. He says, \ufffdWe will test you, sometimes with fear, sometimes with dread, sometimes with poverty, sometimes with hunger, sometimes with outward affliction, sometimes with inward sorrow.\ufffd The outward trial and evident affliction are in fact easy work, for sometimes they are there and sometimes not, like the trial of Abraham and the trial of Job. The complete trial is inward sorrow, which does not leave its place for a moment. When someone is closer, more worthy of friendship, and more suitable for union, his sorrow is more. Such was MuṣṬafā's sorrow. He had no capacity for it on the highest horizon, nor did he have any rest fromit on the expanse of the earth. He was like a moth before a lamp: It does not have the capacity to stay with the lamp, nor the remedy of staying away from the lamp. With the tongue of his state he was saying,\ufffdIn separation I make do because of shame before Your image, in union I burn in fear it will cease.Such is the state of the moth with the candle- in separation it burns and in union it burns.\ufffd\ufffdYes, everyone who seeks union with Me and wants proximity with Me has no escape from taking on the burden of tribulation and tasting the drink of sorrow.\ufffdāsiya, the wife of Pharaoh, sought for the Real's neighborhood and asked for His proximity. She said, \ufffdMy Lord, build for me a house with Thee in the Garden [66:11]. O Lord, I want a room in Your neighborhood, for it is beautiful to have a room in the street of the Friend."
