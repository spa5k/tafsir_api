  "text": "This is the writing in which there is no doubt, a guidance for the godwary.It has been said that This is the writing is an allusion to what God has written against Himself for Muá¸¤ammad's community: \ufffdSurely My mercy takes precedence over My wrath.\ufffd God does that in His words, \ufffdYour Lord has written mercy against Himself\ufffd [6:54]. It has also been said that it is an allusion to the faith and recognition that God has written upon the hearts of the believers. Thus He says, \ufffdHe wrote faith in their hearts\ufffd [58:22].In this verse, it is as if God is saying, \ufffdMy servant, I have written the imprint of faith in your heart, I have mixed in the perfume of friendship, I have decorated paradise for you, I have adornedyour heart with the light of recognition, I have lit up the candle of union with Me, I have stamped the seal of love on your heart, and I have written the inscription of passion in your awareness.\ufffd\ufffdHe wrote faith in their hearts: I wrote in the Tablet, but I wrote only your description. I wrote in your hearts, but I wrote only My description. I wrote your description in the Tablet, and I showed it to Gabriel. I wrote My description in your heart-how could I have shown it to an enemy? In the Tablet I wrote your loyalty and disloyalty; in your heart I wrote laudation and rec- ognition. What I wrote about you has not changed. How could what I wrote about Myself change? Moses carved out a stone from the mountain, and, when I wrote the Torah therein, the stone turned into emerald. The recognizer's heart was made of harsh stone-when I wrote My name therein, it turned into a notebook of exaltedness.\ufffdA guidance for the godwary. In another place, He said, \ufffdIt is a guidance and a healing for those who have faith\ufffd [41:44]. He is saying that this Qur'an is guidance for the godwary, heal- ing for the faithful, the cause of familiarity, assistance for clarity, a key for the ears, a mirror for the eyes, a lamp for hearts, a healing for pain, a light for the eyes of the familiar, springtime for the spirits of the friends, admonition for the fearful, mercy for the faithful."
