  "text": "He it is who created for you all that is in the earth, then He went up to heaven and propor- tioned it as seven heavens, and He is knower of everything.In another place He said, \ufffdHe subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, all together, from Him\ufffd [45:13]. He is saying, \ufffdI created everything in the empire of the earth for you and subjected it to you. My bestowal is not tiny, My generosity toward those who are burnt for Me is not trivial. There will never be any backsliding in My caressing you. Nor is it as if I limited Myself to the empire of the earth, for I also set up the heavens for your gaze, for the pleasure of your eyes, and as a storehouse for your daily provision. My servant! When you step into the street of My covenant, you do not know what good news reaches the heaven-dwellers and the earth-dwellers and how they congratulate each other. I know, for I know everything and reach everyone.\ufffd And He is knower of everything.In this verse there is a subtle point. He did not say, \ufffdWho created you for all that is in the earth.\ufffd He said, \ufffdWho created for you all that is in the earth.\ufffd In other words, \ufffdI created every- thing that is in the empire of the earth and the heavens for your sake, and I created you for My sake.\ufffd Do you not see that He said specifically to Moses, \ufffdI chose thee for Myself\ufffd [20:41], and generally to the creatures, \ufffdI created the jinn and mankind only to worship Me\ufffd [51:56]? It was MuṣṬafā who understood the worth of this declaration and gave thanks for this one of His blessings. On the night of proximity and generosity when he was taken to the heavens, all of creation and the empires of the two worlds were scatted at the feet of his truthfulness. That paragon did not look at it from the corner of his eye. He said, \ufffdI was not created for this.\ufffd The eyesight did not swerve, nor did it trespass [53:17]. Hail to him!Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī, who beautifully traveled in the road of MuṣṬafā's Sunnah and beautifully observed courtesy toward the Presence, said, \ufffdI kept on crossing perils until I found the empires."
