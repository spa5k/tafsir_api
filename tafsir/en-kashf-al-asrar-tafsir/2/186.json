  "text": "And when My servants ask thee about Me, surely I am near. I respond to the supplication of the supplicator when he supplicates Me. So let them respond to Me and have faith in Me. Perhaps they will be led aright.He is saying, \ufffdWhen My servants ask you about Me, those are the servants who hang on to the ring of veneration for Me. They have fled to My street, put aside everything less than Me, undertaken to serve Me, believed in Me, and cut themselves off from secondary causes. They have wrapped the turban of trial around their heads and bought Our love with spirit and heart. They came intoexistence with passion, and they are leaving with passion.\ufffdWith passion my steed set out from nonexistence, my night always bright with union's wine.Of that wine not forbidden by my religionmy lips will not stay dry till I'm back in nonexistence.\ufffdWhen servants like this and friends like this ask you about Me and seek My mark from you, know that I am near to them. Uncalled and unsought, I am near. Unhoped for and unperceived, I am near. With My firstness, with My attributes, I am self-standing and near. Not by the worthiness of the servant-I am near by My own description.\ufffdThis is the same that He said to His speaking companion Moses, on that pitch black night on the edge of the Mount when he was called from the right bank of the watercourse [28:30]. Mo- ses was called from the right bank of the blessed watercourse: \ufffdO great Moses!,\ufffd for after Adam, no one heard the speech of the Real with the ears of his head except Moses. He was called, \ufffdO Moses!\ufffd Moses became unsettled, he could not bear it, and his patience fled. How can patience overcome love? Love will always snatch away the hand of patience. In his burning, distraction, and inability to bear, he said to the caller, \ufffdYou have made me hear You. Where should I seek You?\ufffd The call came, \ufffdO Moses, seek as you like, for I am with you. I am nearer to you than the spirit is to your body, your life-vein is to you, your speaking is to your mouth. The speech is My speech, the light is My light, and I am the Lord of the Worlds."
