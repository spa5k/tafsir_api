  "text": "Their prophet said to them, \ufffdThe sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the ark within which is tranquility from your Lord.\ufffdWhenever someone finds a drink from the cup of recognition on the carpet of the religion's good fortune, the cupbearer of that drink is the sultan of tranquility. The exalted lodging place of the sultan of tranquility is the capital city of the heart: He it is who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the faithful [48:4]. The subtle reality of the heart is the dwelling place of the attribute of eternity: \ufffdSurely the hearts are between two fingers of the All-Merciful.\ufffdWhat a great difference there is between two groups of people! The tranquility of one group was in the ark, and the ark was under the determination of the Children of Israel, sometimes here and sometimes there, sometimes like this and sometimes like that. The tranquility of the other group is in their hearts, in the grasp of the Real's attributes. The Adamite has no hand in it, the angel no access to it. He comes between a man and his heart [8:24].Shiblī said, \ufffdThe curtains were taken down and the veils lifted in the realities of the secret core, and many unseen things were unveiled to my secret core. I saw hell like a roaring dragon and rapacious lion. It was playing with the people and pulling them to itself with its tail. It saw me and displayed its mightiness. It wanted its share from me. I gave it all of my outward organs and parts and had no fear of their burning. I had no concern for outward burning because of my inner burning.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdAll fires burn the body, but the fire of friendship burns the spirit.No one can be patient in face of that spirit-burning fire.\ufffdIf He burns you, say \ufffdBurn!\ufffd, if He caresses, say \ufffdCaress!\ufffdIt's best for the passionate man to be put between water and fire.Shiblī said, \ufffdWhen I gave my makeup and form to the fire, the turn of the heart arrived. The fire wanted my heart. I said, 'I will toss it away without fear.' A voice came to my secret core, 'OShiblī, leave the heart alone, for the heart is not yours, nor is it under your determination."
