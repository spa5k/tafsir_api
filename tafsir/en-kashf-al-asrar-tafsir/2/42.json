  "text": "And confuse not truth with falsehood.Be careful not to mix truth and falsehood. Do not put truthfulness together with lying, the ap- proved together with the unapproved. I do not say not to recognize falsehood. You must recognize it so as to avoid it, and you must recognize truth so as go after it. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdO God, show us truth as truth and provide us with choosing it, and show us falsehood as falsehood and provide us with avoiding it.\ufffdConcerning the verse, \ufffdAnd confuse not truth with falsehood,\ufffd the masters of the realities have said that the meaning is that you should not mix together the share of the soul and the food of the heart, for the two do not get along. The owner of the heart is elated at the rightful due of truth, but the servant of the soul is bound by the share of the soul. How can the two come together? This world is trifling and the next world precious. How can the two get along? Friendship with the Cre- ator is beginningless and endless felicity, but friendship with the created is a ready bane. How can the two come together? God has not given any man two hearts in his breast [33:4]. God-worship and self-worship are opposites. How can the two be brought together in one makeup?Love for both self and the loving Friend won't reach you.Want either this or that-you won't reach both."
