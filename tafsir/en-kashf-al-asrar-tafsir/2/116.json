  "text": "They say, \ufffdGod has taken a son.\ufffd Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs what is in the heavens and the earth; all are devoted to Him.He is pure, without fault, incomparable, the one Lord-one in forbearance, one in loyalty, one in love. If the servant does harm, He does not cut off from him, for He is one in forbearance. If the servant inclines toward another, He does not so incline, because He is one in loyalty. If the servantbreaks the covenant, He does not break it, because He is one in love.He is one in Essence, one in attributes, rid of causes, incomparable with obsequiousness, praised by all expressions, fitting for all allusions, the creator of time and the hours, the determiner of instants and moments. His artisanry has no defect, His determining no contrivance, His descrip- tion no likeness. He is a determiner who has always been.Powerful, Knowing, Alive, Desiring, Hearing, Seeing, clothed in majesty,Hallowed beyond having an equal, transcending opinion and talk.*O Essence of perfection lacking nothing!The effusion of generosity comes from Your hand alone.He is a lord without associate or partner, a king without equal or need. His promise is no lie, His name is no metaphor. The door of withholding is shut and the door of His munificence open. He is a forgiver of sins, a caresser of the faulty. He knows without cause, He is able without artifice. He is alone without paucity, spreader of the creed, outside of number, artisan without toil, self- standing until the Endless, hallowed beyond envy. His name is Subtle, Self-Standing, and Self- Sufficient; He begets not, nor was He begotten, and equal to Him is none [112:2-4].So much are You face-to-face in my heart, so much hidden from my eyes,that your describer cannot describe You- in Your attributes You are as You are.A renowned Lord, caring for His servants-ears are open to His name, hearts imprisoned by His message, tawḤīd-voicers fallen into His snare, yearners drunk with the love from His cup. He is the lovingly kind such that no one in the universe is like Him in loving kindness. The disobedient and destitute have hope in Him, and the poor are happy in the subsistence of His majesty."
