They have reached union with the exaltedness of the Patron.If I die, don't say about me, \ufffdHe's dead.\ufffdSay, \ufffdThe dead man came to life in the Friend who took him.\ufffdAlive is the one who lives through Him, not through the spirit. Whoever comes to life in the Friend lives forever.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO Lord, if someone is occupied with You, how could his occupa- tion come to an end? When someone lives through You, how could he ever die? If the spirit in the body is deprived of You, it is like an imprisoned corpse. Alive in reality is he who lives with You. God's praise be on those slain concerning whom the King says that they are alive.\ufffdNo, they are alive, but you are unaware. The cloak of awe is on the shoulders of their exalted- ness, the shadow of the Tremendous Throne is their resting-place of intimacy, and the Presence of the Real's majesty is the place of their spirit's repose, in a seat of truthfulness, at an Omnipotent King [54:55]."
