When the wealth is exhausted, they do not slacken from witnessing Him for a moment, night and day.24 This is as they say:Wealth, gold, things-gamble them away for nothing. When the work reaches your spirit, gamble it away!Spending wealth in the road of the religion according to the Shariah is the work of the faithful, and throwing away the spirit in the contemplation of the majesty and beauty of the Patron in respect of the Haqiqah is the work of the chevaliers. This is the effort of servanthood by the servants. What then is worthy of God and the divine generosity toward the servants?!"
