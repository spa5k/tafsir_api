  "text": "Guard over the prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand before God devoutly.In the tongue of allusion to guard over the prayer is that, when the servant comes into the presence of the prayer, he comes with awe, and when he leaves, he leaves with reverence. As long as he is in the prayer, he is described by courtesy. He keeps his body in the outward service, his heart in the realities of union, and his secret core along with his spirit in the ease of whispered prayer. \ufffdThe praying person is whispering with his Lord.\ufffdAbū Bakr Shiblī said, \ufffdIf I were given the choice to enter the prayer or to go into paradise, I would not chose that high paradise over the prayer. Even if paradise is joy and blessings, the prayer is secret whispering with the Patron of Blessings. That is the place of pleasure for water and clay, and this is the place of gazing for spirit and heart. That is roasted fowl in the garden of approval, and this is repose and ease [56:89] in the garden of the Beloved.\ufffdFor the sake of gazing stroll once into the Beloved's garden, see the Beloved scattering spirit beneath your feet.MuṣṬafā gave no station the mark he gave to the prayer when he said, \ufffd'The delight of my eyes was placed in the prayer.' Amongst the caresses and beauties, the brightness of my eyes lies in being occupied with Him and whispering secretly with Him.\ufffdHere is my heart-look into it and see: is there any goal other than You?There was a man called Abū ʿAlī Siyāh, who was unique in his era. Whenever anyone went to see him, he would say, \ufffdI'm a carefree man. I have no occupation. The brightness of my eyes lies in seeing a man of His road or talking about Him with someone.\ufffdEvery night I talk to my heart about You.I seek Your scent from the dawn breeze.The knower of the Tariqah, ʿAbdallāh Anṣārī, said, \ufffdO God, O lovingly kind, O helper! Exalted is he who has one breath with You! May I have a breath in which no one mixes, a breath that after- wards has no veil. For me that one breath is enough in the two worlds."
