  "text": "Mothers shall suckle their children two whole years-for those who desire to complete the suckling.Great is that Lord who is unique in loving kindness and without peer in caressing servants. He be- stows in testing, He is loyal to assurances. If we call Him, He hears, and if we do not, He knows. He is generous, loving, love-showing, and love-increasing; gentle, defect-hiding, excuse-hearing, a good God. His bounty is beyond all bounty, His generosity beyond all generosity, His mercy greater than all mercies, His love not like other loves.The example given of utmost mercy is the mercy of mothers, but God's mercy toward His servants is more than that, and His love is not like their love. Do you not see that He commands mothers to give milk to their children for two complete years, He urges them to nurture them, and He counsels them to take care of them? He does not confine Himself to the love of mothers and leave it at that. This is so that you will know that God is more lovingly kind to the servant than a mother is to her child.Once MuṣṬafā was passing by when a woman with a child in her arms was baking bread. They had told her that God's Messenger would be passing. She came forward and said, \ufffdO Messenger of God! We have heard you say that the God of the world's inhabitants is more lovingly kind to His servants than a mother to her child.\ufffdThe Messenger said, \ufffdYes, that is so.\ufffdThat woman became happy and said, \ufffdO Messenger of God! A mother would never toss her child into this oven.\ufffdMuṣṬafā wept. Then he said, \ufffdGod chastises in the Fire only those who refuse to say, 'There is no god but God.'\ufffdKaʿb ʿUjra said that one day God's Messenger said to his companions, \ufffdWhat do you say about a man slain in God's path?\ufffdThey said, \ufffdGod and His Messenger know best.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdHe is in the Garden.\ufffd Then he said, \ufffdWhat do you say about a man concerning whom two just men have said that they knew nothing of him but good?\ufffdThey said, \ufffdGod and His Messenger know best.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdHe is in the Garden.\ufffd Then he said, \ufffdWhat do you say about a dead man concerning whom two just witnesses say that they never saw any good from him?\ufffdThe Companions said, \ufffdHe is in the Fire."
