'Patience is the key to relief.'\ufffdIf someone does not have the patience of the Men, let him not come to the Men's playing field.You have not the legs of men-don't put on men's clothing!You have not the means of no means-don't brag of selflessness! [DS 491]Once that paragon of the world stepped into this playing field, he was not left for one hour without sorrow and grief. If he sat for a while cross-legged, the address came, \ufffdSit like a servant!\ufffd If once he put a ring on his finger, the whip of rebuke would come down: \ufffdWhat, did you reckon that We created you aimlessly?\ufffd [23:115]. If once he placed his foot on the ground boldly, the command would come, \ufffdWalk not in the earth exultantly\ufffd [17:37]. When the work reached the limit and he was being tried from every corner, he sighed and said, \ufffdNo prophet whatsoever has been tormented as I have been tormented.\ufffdThe address came from the Exalted Presence, \ufffdO paragon! When someone's heart and spirit witness Me, will he complain of the burden of trial?\ufffd All the venom of grief in the treasuries of the Unseen was poured into one cup and placed in his hand, and then a curtain was lifted from his se- cret core: \ufffdO paragon! Drink all this venom while contemplating My beauty! And be patient with thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in Our eyes [52:48].\ufffd The tongue of the state was saying,\ufffdWere the Beloved's hand to pour poison for me, poison from His hand would be sweet.*\ufffdThough Your hand is fire, it is my bed of roses.All that comes from You is sweet, whether healing or pain.\ufffdThough it indeed is hard, except for the humble. Humbleness is a stipulation of the prayer. It is a mark of the servant's need. The humble in the prayer are praised by the Real and chosen among the creatures. Prosperous are the faithful, those who are humble in their prayers [23:1-2]. Humble- ness in the prayer is both outward and inward."
