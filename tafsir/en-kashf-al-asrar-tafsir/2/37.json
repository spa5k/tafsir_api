  "text": "Then Adam received from his Lord some words.Then He spoke with the lid on, not letting out the details, lest the secrets of love fall into the open and so that love's story would stay concealed.I said to her, \ufffdHalt [qifī].\ufffd She said, \ufffdQāf.\ufffdShe did not say, \ufffdI have halted,\ufffd thereby keeping the secret from the watchers. Nor did she say, \ufffdI will not halt,\ufffd thereby showing consideration for the lover's heart.3Although the tongue of commentary does not speak of it, the folk of allusion say that it is likely that at the moment of farewell lovers say, \ufffd'When you depart from me, do not forget my covenant. Even if awareness of me dwindles one day, do not prefer another over me.'4 O Adam! Do not forget Our compact and do not choose anyone over Me.\ufffd The tongue of his state replied,\ufffdMy heart is Your fellow-traveler and companion- how could it attach its love anywhere else?A heart for whom You are both spirit and awareness- how could it forget Your remembrance?\ufffd"
