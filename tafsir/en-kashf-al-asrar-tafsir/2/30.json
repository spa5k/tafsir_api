  "text": "And when thy Lord said to the angels, \ufffdSurely I am setting in the earth a vicegerent,\ufffd they said, \ufffdWhat, wilt Thou set therein one who will work corruption there, and shed blood, while we glorify Thy praise and call Thee holy?\ufffd He said, \ufffdSurely I know what you do not know.\ufffdThere was a world at ease. No heart burned with passion and no breast was deluded by mad fervor. Then the ocean of mercy began to boil. The treasuries of obedient deeds were full, and no dust oflassitude had settled on the foreheads of the obedient in their obedience. The banner of their boast- ful claim, \ufffdWe glorify Thy praise,\ufffd was raised to Capella.All those in the cosmos who had any subtle substance began craving for their own selves. The majestic Throne was looking at its own tremendousness and saying, \ufffdPerhaps the script of these words is written for me.\ufffd The Footstool was looking at its own amplitude-\ufffdPerhaps this sermon is being read in my name.\ufffd The eight paradises gazed on their own beauty-\ufffdMaybe this rulership will be given to us.\ufffd None wanted anything to do with dust. Each fell into delusion, each caught by mad fervor.Suddenly, from the Presence of Exaltation and Majesty, this report was given to the world of the angels: \ufffdSurely I am setting in the earth a vicegerent.\ufffd It was not that He was consulting with the angels. Rather, He was laying the foundation of Adam's exaltation and tremendousness. He was not asking for help, but spreading the carpet of Adam's dignity. He was saying, \ufffdThe ruling property of My severity has acted. I have commanded the pen of generosity to write out an inscription from the beginning of the world's ledger to its end. This resolution is written for the inhabitants of both worlds, from the top of the Throne to the bottom of the Carpet: 'The dust-dwelling Adam is granted chieftainship over all the empires. His exalted breast will be bright with the light of recognition. In him the subtleties of My generosity and the artifacts of My bounteousness will become apparent.'\ufffdThis exalted declaration caused the hearts of the proximate angels to quake with awe. They said, \ufffdWhat is this all about? He has not yet been created.\ufffdThe exalted Qur'an was beating the drum of his vicegerency at the threshold of his beauty even though he had not yet entered into the bonds of creation."
