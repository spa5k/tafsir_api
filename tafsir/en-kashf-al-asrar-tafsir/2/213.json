  "text": "The people were one community. Then God sent the prophets as bringers of good news and warning.In terms of allusion and according to the tasting of the chevaliers of the Tariqah, this verse has another intimation and another meaning. The king of the universe, the keeper of the world, the knower of the hidden, is saying that when He first created creatures, He created them in the curtain- ing wrap of createdness. When He made them with such a makeup at the beginning, the darknesses of the attributes of createdness surrounded this created nature. They were all one group in the curtain of obscurity. All were gathered in the darkness of absence, all remained in the captivity of their own makeup. It was just like that chevalier said:\ufffdThe creatures are at ease in the ruins of their own makeup- wink just once to throw the creatures into turmoil!\ufffd [DS 696]Then a courier came from the infinite world to their tininess. MuṣṬafā gave this report about that courier: \ufffdGod created the creatures in darkness. Then He cast upon them something of His light. Whomsoever the light struck was guided, and whomsoever it missed went astray.\ufffdWhen this messenger turned its face from that infinity to their tininess, they all became aware, captive to desire, subjugated by will, wounded by wisdom, their ears fixed on their own fortune and lot: \ufffdWhat is coming to us? What will be decreed for us?\ufffdThen the hand of predetermination divided them into two groups: the lucky and the unlucky. He said about the lucky, \ufffdThese belong to the Garden, and I do not care.\ufffd He said about the unlucky, \ufffdThese belong to the Fire, and I do not care.\ufffd In other words, \ufffdI have no fear of being blamed. I will do whatever occurs to Me and have no regrets. Some are the folk of felicity without any conformity with Me, and some are the folk of wretchedness without any opposition to Me. 'These belong to the Garden, and I do not care' about their disloyalty, and 'These belong to the Fire, and I do not care' about their loyalty. I receive no profit from loyalty, nor do I lose anything from disloyalty. When someone gains faith, he is the one who profits; I stay exactly as I was, with- out equal or need."
