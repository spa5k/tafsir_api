  "text": "And when We gave Moses the book and the discernment.He gave Moses' folk the discernment outwardly, and He placed the discernment in the inwardness of MuḤammad's folk in addition to their outwardness. The inner discernment is a light in the heart of the friends through which they separate truth from falsehood. It is alluded to in His words, \ufffdIf you are wary of God, He will appoint for you a criterion\ufffd [8:29]. This is why MuṣṬafā said to Wābisa, \ufffdAsk for a pronouncement from your heart!\ufffd He also said, \ufffdBe wary of the perspicacity of the man of faith, for he gazes with the light of God.\ufffd When this discernment appears in someone's inwardness, his drinking and aspiration are purified of the dust of others; the walkway of his desire is protected from the debris of customs, the carpet of his days is shaken loose of the opacities of mortal nature, and the eyes of his moment are kept away from the hand of newly arrived things.Then, things that are reports for others are for him face-to-face vision; what had been the knowl- edge of certainty becomes the eye of certainty. No newly arrived thing enters existence in the empire without his heart being aware of it. MuṣṬafā was asked if this has a mark. He said, \ufffdWhen light enters the heart, the breast is expanded.\ufffd Its mark is that the breast is opened up to the divine light. When the breast is opened up, the aspiration becomes high, every sorrow is comforted, scatteredness turns into togetherness, the carpet of subsistence is spread, the rug of annihilation is rolled up, the corner of heartaches is closed off, and the door to the garden of union is opened. In joy and coquetry, he says with the tongue of the state,\ufffdIn the quarter of hope, I have a delightful home,in the story of passion, I have a delightful problem.Why do you ask details about my heart, O spirit of the world?Know, in short, that I have a delighted heart.\ufffd"
