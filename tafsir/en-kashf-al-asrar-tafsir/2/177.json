Rather, piety is he who has faith in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets; who gives wealth despite lov- ing it to kinsfolk, orphans, the indigent, the son of the road, beggars, and slaves; and who per-forms the prayer and gives the alms tax; those who are loyal to their covenant when they make a covenant; those who are patient in misfortune, hardship, and moments of peril. It is they who have been truthful, and it is they who are the godwary.You have learned what the Shariah stipulates in terms of the outward meaning of this verse. Now listen to the inner meaning in the tongue of allusion and recognize the signs of the Haqiqah, for the Haqiqah is to the Shariah as the spirit is to the body. What is a body without a spirit? Such is the Shariah without the Haqiqah.The Shariah is the house of the servitors. All the people are gathered there. They keep it flourishing with service and worship.The Haqiqah is the house of the sanctuary. The recognizers are gathered there. They keep it flourishing with veneration and contemplation.The distance from service and worship to veneration and contemplation is the same as that from familiarity to love. Familiarity is the attribute of wage-earners, and love is the attribute of recognizers.The wage-earner brings all the varieties of piety mentioned in the verse. Then he says, \ufffdOh, if the wind blows against it, or something of it is taken away, I will lose the wage for that.\ufffd The recognizer performs all of it according to its stipulations. Then he says, \ufffdOh, if any of it remains, I will be held back from good fortune.\ufffdAny talk that keeps you back from the road-let it be unbelief or faith.Any picture that holds you back from the Friend-let it be ugly or beautiful. [DS 51]The wage-earner says, \ufffdMy prayer, my fasting, my alms-giving, my patience in trials, my loyalty to covenants!\ufffd The recognizer says in the tongue of abasement,\ufffdWho am I to wear the cloak of loyalty to You,to have my eyes carry the burden of Your disloyalty,To have the spirit's scent come from my lips and speak of You,to grow an exalted branch in my heart and suffer Your trial?\ufffd [DS 933]The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdHow should I have known that the share of the wage-earner is ever- lasting paradise, and the hope of the recognizer is one glance? How should I have known that the wage-earner is wishing for houris and palaces, and the recognizer is inundated by light in the sea of face-to-face vision?\ufffdWhen he was dying, Abū ʿAlī Rūdbārī said to his sister, \ufffdO FāṬima, look, the doors of heaven have opened, the Gardens have been adorned! The maid-servants have gathered at the battlements and they are saying, 'Enjoy yourself, O Abū ʿAlī! All this was built for you!'\ufffdThe tongue of Abū ʿAlī's state was answering, \ufffdO God, how could I be joyful with paradise and houris? If You give me one breath, from that breath I will build a paradise!\ufffdYour rightful due is that I look on no one else with the eye of love until I see You."
