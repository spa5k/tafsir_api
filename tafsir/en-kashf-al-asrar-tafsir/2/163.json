  "text": "And your God is one God. There is no god but He, the All-Merciful, the Ever-Merciful.This is the description of the one Lord, the one Lord God and King. He is one in magnanimity and governance, one in forbearance and beautiful doing, one in generosity and peerlessness, one in loving kindness and servant-caressing. Every magnificence is the mantle of His majesty, and in that He is one. Every tremendousness and all-compellingness is the shawl of His lordhood, and in that He is one. He is one in Essence, one in attributes, one in deed and mark, one in loyalty and compact, one in gentleness and caressing, one in love and friendship.On the day of apportioning, who was there but He, the One? Before the day of apportioning who was there? That same One. After the day of apportioning, who handed over those portions? That same One. Who shows? That same One. Who adorns? That same One.He is more apparent than everything in the world of apparentness, and in this apparentness He is one. He is more hidden than anything in the world of hiddenness, and in this hiddenness He is one.O You who are more face-to-face than anything in the world! You are more hidden than the world's most hidden thing!O You who are more distant than all that the servants suppose!You are closer to the servants than the spirit's vein.How disloyal the Adamite who does not know the worth of this declaration and the exaltedness of this ascription! God says, \ufffdAnd your God is one God.\ufffd The wonder is not that He ascribed the servants to Himself, joined them to Himself, and said, \ufffdSurely My servants\ufffd [15:42]. The wonder is that He ascribed Himself to the servants and joined His name to their name, saying, \ufffdYour God.\ufffd This is not because His lordhood must be joined to the servant's servanthood, or that the servants are deserving of that. Rather, in generosity and loving kindness He Himself is unique and one. In magnanimity He is worthy of every generous bestowal and every gift.In the place of our Heart-taker's beauty and loveliness, we are not suited for Him-He is suited for us.And your God is one God. There was no world and no Adam. There were no tracks and no traces, there was no one in the house."
