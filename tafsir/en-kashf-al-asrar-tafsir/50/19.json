You also will not escape. “Death is a cup, and everyone will drink it.” How will the passing days that were not loyal to Adam be loyal to you? How will the lifespan that ended for Noah keep you in subsistence? How will the moment of death that attacked Abra- ham let you get away? How will the death that ambushed Solomon be lenient toward you? How will the entrusted angel who demanded MuḤammad's spirit treat you kindly? If you bring to hand the lifespan of Noah, the wealth of Korah, the kingdom of Solomon, and the wisdom of Luqmān, they will be useless at the door of death and will show you no favor. A little less than 7000 years have passed since the Adamites began this journey. They come from the loins to the wombs, and they go from the wombs to the face of the earth, and from the face of the earth to its stomach. The whole world is a graveyard. Beneath it is all remorse, above it all remorse. Lift up your head and ask heaven: “How many dear ones do you have in your stomach?” Ask the lofty palace about its inhabitant whom it saved from the hard and soft of life. He established his kingdom and enslaved the people, then death's messenger threw him on his face. O fooled by wishes! O heedless of the moment of death! O prisoner of greed! O servant of need! How long will you grieve for summer in winter and grieve for winter in summer? You do not think about the work that will come about inescapably and you do not gather the supplies for the road that in verified truth will be walked. You arrange the work of this world and do not provide for death. You poor wretch, your death is right behind you. Remember it! Your home is the grave. Make it flourish! Today you are asleep-wait till you wake up. Today you are drunk-wait till you are sober. You gather the chaff of this world and keep back from what deserves to be done.  Why do you want to remain with this forever? Wait till the angel of death comes and plunders your life, the heirs come and plunder your wealth, the adversary comes and plunders your obedience, the worms come and plunder your skin and flesh. Alas if in this heedlessness and slipping, in this bustle and darkness, the enemy should come and plunder your faith! What a poor wretch you will be-without body, without life, without property, without gain and loss, without obedience, and without faith! If you have any doubt about death, count back the number of your fathers to Adam the Chosen, not one of whom was released from death. In the world there was no one who had the position and respect of MuṣṬafā the Arab in the Exalted Threshold, but he was shown no leniency: “Surely thou wilt die and surely they will die [39:30]. O master before whose perfection the totality of perfection is but a dot! O paragon the vision of the face of whose beauty turns the bright moon black! The world's sun is distracted in your north wind. Riẓwān approves of being the doorman for your ṣuhayb and Bilāl. The angels scatter stars from the spheres on your harmonious cheek and stature. Musk is envious of your tresses and mole! Splendor [majd], praise [Ḥamd], creed [milla], and good fortune [dawla] are joined with your M, Ḥ, M, and D! Despite all this distinction and rank, O master, you must walk the road of annihilation and you must sleep on the floor of the grave. Your father Abraham was not released from this severity. Your brother Moses did not escape from this poison. “O Muhammad, now the work is finished and the foundations of the Shariah have been put in order: Today I have perfected for you your religion [5:3]. You have read out the edict of messeng- erhood, you have conquered Mecca, you have triumphed over the enemies, you have shredded the skirt of unbelief, you have destroyed the stalwarts of Quraysh, and you have purified the Kaaba of idols. In fear of you the Byzantine emperor is unsettled in his palace, the king in Ethiopia is your servant boy, and Heraclius in Byzantium is obedient to your command and message. Heaven is delighted by the top of your head and earth is delighted by the bottom of your feet. The time has come for you to turn your face to death and leave all that entirely.  Once a work reaches perfec- tion, it turns to decrease. When the moon is a crescent in heaven it increases; when it becomes full and complete in its radiance, it turns toward decrease. In springtime the branches of trees increase every day, bringing leaves, making flowers bloom, keeping the world perfumed, and making the meadows luminous. When they reach perfection and give fruit, they fall into decrease. “O master of the world, O paragon of Adam's children! The time has come for you to put the earring of death on the ear of servanthood and aim for My Presence, so that I may do what you want.” The story of his death has already been told in the Surah al-AnbiyāÌ. And the agony of death comes with the rightful due. Although the state of death appears dif- ficult outwardly, therein the faithful and the friends have nothing but exaltedness and joy; at every instant a comfort comes from the Friend, at every moment a robe of honor. This is why MuṣṬafā said, “The gift of the faithful is death.” No possessor of truthfulness fears death. Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī saw his father battling with one shirt. He said, “This is not the dress of warriors!” ʿAlī said, “Your father does not care if he falls upon death or if death falls upon him.” Truthfulness is the traveling supplies for the journey to death. Death is the road of subsistence, and subsistence is the cause of the encounter. “When someone loves the encounter with God, God loves the encounter with him.” When the folk of heedlessness reach the edge of death, [they look at what will be given to them. But when the folk of the Haqiqah reach the edge of death,] they look at what will be taken from them. The worn-out shirt will be taken from his back and a new robe put in its place. A man has had one shirt for seventy years and it has become worn out. It is taken from his back and he is clothed in the shirt of the endless kingdom. That is a place for happiness, not weeping. The life of ʿAmmār Yāsir reached ninety years. When he took a spear in hand, his hand trembled. MuṣṬafā had said to him that his last food in this world would be milk.  ʿAmmār was present in the battle of Siffin, a spear in hand, and he became thirsty. He asked for a drink of water and was given a cup of milk. He went forth saying, “Today I will encounter the beloveds, Muhammad and his party.” O chevalier! The life of this world is a dark curtain pulled over your days. On the day of death, the hand of gentleness will pull back the curtain so that you may reach the center point of endless life. As long as this life is in place, endless subsistence is behind the curtain. When the curtain is lifted, endless subsistence will show its face to you. That is His words, “We shall surely give him to live a goodly life” [16:97]. It is said that the person of faith in the grave is like the infant in its mother's womb. Think what the state was at first in the womb: You were weak, without strength or power, without going or taking, without hearing or speaking: “I made you appear in those darknesses and held up your mother's liver to you like a mirror. I made your shape apparent within it so that whatever you needed she ate and conveyed to you. You were in joy and ease, and no one was aware of you. At the end I will do what I did at first: I will take away your seeing, speaking, hearing, taking, and go- ing and I will place you in the grave. Just as at first I made your mother's liver your mirror, so I will make the grave your mirror. Just as I conveyed to you the ease of the blessings of this world in the womb and no one was aware, so also in the end I will convey to you the ease of the scent of para- dise and no one will be aware. Thus will you know that I am ever-merciful, generous, and gentle. “My servant, I had the power to make you appear without the prison of the womb. I had the power to convey the prison of the grave to the resurrection, but I kept you nine months in the prison of the womb and I kept you for long years in the grave. Why do I do this? “My servant, when I wanted to free Joseph from the hand of his brothers' envy, I kept him for three days in the prison of the well.  When I wanted to entrust the kingdom of Egypt to him, I kept him for seven years in prison. O Joseph the Sincerely truthful! Being at ease from the hands of the enviers is worth three days of prison in the well. The empire and rulership of Egypt is worth seven years in Egypt's prison. For the tawḤīd-voicing person of faith, seeing the beauty of mother and father is worth nine months in the prison of the womb. Seeing Him who has no beginning and no end is worth a thousand years in the prison of the grave.”"
