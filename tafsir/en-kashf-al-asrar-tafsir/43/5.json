You hear unbelief from the servant and do not hold back blessings. You offer him repentance and pardon, and You call him back with Your message and address. If he does come back, You promise him forgiveness. 'If they desist, He will forgive them what is past' [8:38]. Since You are like this with the bad-doing enemy, what will You be like with the beautiful-doing friend?\ufffd"
