As for the sincerely truthful and the near ones, He will address them with this: \ufffdMy servants, did you yearn for Me? Did you love to encounter Me?\ufffd This will be an exalted state and a great rank: the intender will have reached the Intended, the seeker the Sought, the lover the Beloved. The tree of union will bear fruit, the messenger of the Sought will come forth, and the Companion will come out with the stipulation of passion.At last the Friend will come out with the stipulation of passion- the suffering of my passion for Him will come to an end."
