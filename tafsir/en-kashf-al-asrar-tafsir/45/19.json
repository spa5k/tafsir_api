  "text": "Surely they will not make thee unneedy of God in anything. “If God desires a blessing for you, no one will prevent it, and if He desires a trial for you, no one will turn it away. So do not attach your reflection to any created thing and do not turn the attentive- ness of your mind to anything. Depend on your Lord and trust in Him.” “O paragon of the world, O master of Adam's children, O sun of felicity's sphere, O moon of mastery's heaven, O lodging of the world of knowledge, O pearl of the oyster of eminence, O embroidery on the garment of existence! We separated you out from the world's folk, we orphaned you from father and mother, and We brought out your family and relatives against you so that your heart would be free of all and be totally detached for obeying and serving Me. From the wide roads We made for you the road of the religion, and you call the world's folk to that road: Say: 'This is my path; I invite to God' [12:108]. “O paragon! On the night of the miʿrāj, We sat you down in the dome of proximity and scattered a hundred thousand gentle gifts on the head of your good fortune. We made the two worlds the dust beneath your feet and brought the celestial figures and the terrestrial center under the banner of your rulership. What We intended was to give you expansiveness on the carpet of intercession. As long as there is the story of the pain of the disobedient, you should lift it up to Us and apologize for it on their behalf: Take us not to task if we forget or make mistakes [2:286]. O MuḤammad! If tomorrow you ask Us for the two worlds and the world's folk, you will have asked only for the dust beneath your feet. And if We, through eternal gentleness, use the dust of those feet in the work of one of your servants, that is not far-fetched for Our perfection.” The collyrium of insight had been daubed on the eyes of the prophethood of that greatest of the prophets. He knew that dust should be a carrier of burdens, not headstrong, because dust is for carrying burdens, not for being headstrong. Do you not see how the Exalted Lord threatens and warns those who were headstrong and refractory:"
