  "text": "Whatever is in the heavens and the earth asks of Him. Each day He is upon some task.The faithful are two groups: the worshipers and the recognizers. The asking of each group is in the measure of their aspirations, and the caressing of each is suited to their capacity. The worshipers want everything from Him, the recognizers want Him Himself.AḤmad ibn Abi'l-Ḥawārī saw the Real in a dream. He said, 'O AḤmad, all the people are seek- ing from Me, except Abū Yazīd-he is seeking Me.\ufffdI set out for You seeking the heights,and others set out for their livelihood.*Each has a prayer-niche in some direction,but SanāÌī's prayer-niche is Your street. [DS 1004]At this threshold everyone has a station and each has what is suited for him.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, everyone indigent has a portion of Your munificence, everyone in pain has a physician from Your generosity, and all have a portion from the embracing- ness of Your mercy.\ufffdEach He keeps in a place and each He dyes in a color. This is why He says, \ufffdEach day He is upon some task.\ufffd He lifts up one group and puts down others. He puts one at the front of the hall of worth with the attribute of exaltedness, He keeps another at the back with the shoes, in abasement itself. He seats one on the carpet of gentleness, He puts another under the carpet of severity. He pulled Adam the dust-dweller up from the dust of abasement and placed the throne of prosperity on the head of his aspiration, without bias. He pulled down ʿAzāzīl, who was the teacher of the angels, from the celestial world and hung him at the crossroads of the causeless desire from the rack of punishment, without iniquity. To one group He says, \ufffdSo rejoice!\ufffd [9:111], to another group He says, \ufffdDie in your rage!\ufffd [3:119].Moses the speaking-companion set off in search of fire. When he left he was a shepherd in a blanket, when he came back he was a prophet, God's speaking-companion. Balaam Beor, who knew the greatest name, went up a mountain as a friend by virtue of form, but came back down as a dog by virtue of attribute and meaning."
