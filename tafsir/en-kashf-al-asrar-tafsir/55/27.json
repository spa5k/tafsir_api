  "text": "All that is upon it undergoes annihilation, and there subsists the face of thy Lord, Pos- sessor of Majesty and Generous Giving.This is the same that He says elsewhere: \ufffdWhat is with you runs out, but what is with God subsists\ufffd [16:96]. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdPrefer what subsists over what undergoes annihilation.\ufffd This world is the Abode of Delusion, the afterworld the Abode of Joy. This world is the Abode of Annihilation and the afterworld the Abode of Subsistence.The breeze of intelligence does not reach those who choose what undergoes annihilation over the subsistent, who put aside the Abode of Joy and build up the Abode of Delusion. Even if the empire of the world and the empire of Adam's children were beneath your seal ring and the keys to this world's treasures given to you, the outcome of all would be annihilation, so fixing the heart on it would be an error. Listen to these words of wisdom, testaments of the sages, and words of advice of the great:\ufffdBeing satisfied with words without deeds is the work of the deluded.\ufffd \ufffdDepending on the resources of others is the vocation of the indigent.\ufffd \ufffdDelighting in borrowed clothes is the custom of the idle.\ufffd\ufffdBeing happy with others' robes of honor is the conduct of the unintelligent.\ufffd \ufffdBeing disloyal and hoping for loyalty is the act of double-dealers.\ufffd"
