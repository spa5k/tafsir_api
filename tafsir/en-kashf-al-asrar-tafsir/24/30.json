They should throw the dust of nonbeing into the eyes of their own being, and from the tablet of their existence they should read out reproach to the deceiving soul. Because of the pain of his own being, MuḤammad the Arab, the unique pearl of the oceans of messengerhood and the centerpiece of the necklace of evidence, used to lament, \ufffdWould that the Lord of MuḤammad had never created MuḤammad!\ufffd Those who were the pre- ceders, the truthful, and the wayfarers of the road never paid the slightest attention to themselves. They were not happy with their own being and did not look at themselves with the eye of approval.One day Junayd was sitting with Ruwaym when Shiblī came in, and Shiblī was exceedingly kind-hearted. When Junayd's words were finished, Ruwaym looked at Junayd and said, \ufffdHe is a kind-hearted man, this Shiblī.\ufffdJunayd said, \ufffdYou are talking about someone who is one of those who have been rejected by the Threshold.\ufffd When Shiblī heard this, he was broken. He got up in shame and went outside.Ruwaym, \ufffdJunayd, what were those words you said about Shiblī? You know the purity and truthfulness of his state.\ufffdJunayd, \ufffdYes, Shiblī is one of the great ones at the Threshold. But, when you speak to Shiblī, do not speak to him from beneath the Throne, for His swords spill blood. Ruwaym, those words of yours concerning his purification were a sword aimed at his days to hamstring the steed of his practice. I made my words into a shield to repel that sword.\ufffdSay to the faithful that they cast down their eyes. One group do not look at this world, and they are the renunciants. Another group do not look at the realm of being, and they are the folk of recognition. Still another group are the companions of guarding and awe; just as they do not look at others with their hearts, so also they do not see themselves worthy of witnessing."
