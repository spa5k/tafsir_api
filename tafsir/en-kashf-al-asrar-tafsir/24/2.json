  "text": "The fornicatress and the fornicator-flog each of them a hundred lashes, and let no clem- ency toward them seize you in God's religion, if you have faith in God and the Last Day. And let a group of the faithful witness their chastisement.The world's folk are three groups: the common people, the elect of the Presence, and the elect of the elect. If the common people fornicate, their penalty, in the tongue of the Shariah, is whipping or stoning. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdTake this from me! Take this from me! God has appointed for them a path: for virgins, one hundred stripes and banishment; for those formerly married, one hundred stripes and stoning.\ufffd He also said, \ufffdReceive kindly the stumbles of those with positions except in the case of penalties.\ufffdThe fornication of the elect is the gazing of the eyes. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThe fornication of the eyes is the gaze.\ufffd Their penalty is to cast down the eyesight and to turn the eyes away from the soul's pleasures and appetites, even if they are licit. The Prophet said, \ufffdCast down your eyes, guard your private parts, and hold back your hands.\ufffdThe fornication of the elect of the elect is the heart's thoughts about anything less than the Real. If they give something else access to their secret core, this is counted in the Tariqah as forni- cation. Their penalty is disentanglement from attachments and withdrawal from people. God says, \ufffdSay 'God,' then leave them\ufffd [6:91].Let no clemency toward them seize you in God's religion, if you have faith in God. One of them said this means, \ufffdIf you are among the folk of affection and love for Me, oppose those who oppose My command and do what I have prohibited. No one is a lover who has patience with op- position to his beloved.\ufffdJunayd said, \ufffdTenderness toward those in opposition is like turning away from those who conform.\ufffd In other words, \ufffdBeing tender to those who oppose at the moment of opposition is just like turning away from those who conform at the moment of their conformity.\ufffdHaving mercy in accordance with the Shariah is beautiful and praiseworthy. \ufffdThe All-Merci- ful has mercy on those who are merciful.\ufffd But, it is not a stipulation to have mercy as a requisite of nature and habit at the moment of opposition, and it is not allowable to be remiss in enacting the penalties."
