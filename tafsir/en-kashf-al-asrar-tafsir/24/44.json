All of them are put to use by His will and His power. How can there be conformity and opposition when He turns about the night and the day along with what is within them and He stands over the things and in the things through their subsistence and their annihilation. Finding does not become intimate with Him, nor does not finding bring about alienation.\ufffdWhatever the ulama have said is a report and whatever the shaykhs have said is a tradition.The reality of the Real is beyond reports and traditions.A field has been placed before the creatures and the call has gone out, \ufffdO folk of the world! Step into this field and walk in the veil. Know not where you go, and know not whence you are coming. Set out from the threshold of Our knowledge and settle down at the threshold of Our de- cree. Tighten the belt of serving Us and keep watch over Our will. Be ready for Our power, which comes along with Our pardon and forgiveness and Our severity and punishment. 'The power of the powerful suspends every contrivance.'\ufffdWhen someone's secret core is the mine of secret whispering, his heart is in the grasp of joy, his forehead has the mark of prosperity, and the eye of his certainty sees with the light of learn- ing lessons from the acts of the Majestic, then he will be aware of the secrets and intimations in these verses and understand these states, for the Exalted Lord says, \ufffdSurely in that is a lesson for the possessors of eyes.\ufffd In another place He says, \ufffdSurely in that is a reminder for him who has a heart\ufffd [50:37]."
