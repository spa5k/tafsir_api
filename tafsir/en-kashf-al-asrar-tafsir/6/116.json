  "text": "Wert thou to obey most of those in the earth, they would misguide thee from the path of God.In terms of number, God's delegates are few, but they have weight and gravity. The folk of false- hood are many, but they have no weight or meaning. For a world of metaphor, one iota of reality is enough. For a world of foolishness and falsehood, one breath of the lords of finding is enough.One swat of the Lion for a world full of carrion-eaters,one blast of the Trumpet for a hundred thousand Pharaoh-natures! [DS 184]\ufffdO Muá¸¤ammad! If you see them in terms of number and manyness, they will throw you into trouble. If you seek to get along with them, they will hold you back from the Real. Obey Our command, and turn away from them. So shout out what thou art commanded, and turn away from the associaters\ufffd [15:94]."
