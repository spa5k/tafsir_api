  "text": "Say: \ufffdMy prayer and my sacrifice, my life and my death, belong to God.\ufffdHe who knows that he is in God knows that he belongs to God. When he knows that his soul belongs to God, no portion of him remains for other than God. He surrenders to God's decree, he does not protest against God's predetermination, he does not oppose God's chosen ones, and he does not turn away from embracing God's command.This verse about MuṣṬafā alludes to the station of union. Union is joining with the Real and being released from oneself. The mark of this work is a heart alive through meditation and a tongue loosed in remembrance. One becomes a loan to the creatures, a stranger to oneself, at ease from attachment, at rest with the Real.The Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, ever since You called me, I have been alone in the crowd. When You said 'Come!,' my seven bodily parts heard. What comes forth from the Adamite? The Adamite's worth is clear: His purse is empty, he treads on air.\ufffdThis work was before Adam and Eve, a bestowal before fear and hope, but the Adamite undergoes trials because of seeing. He alone is joyful who is free of seeing causes and disloyaltoward his own self. Though the millwheel of the states is turning, so what? The pivot of His will is in place.\ufffdO friend, I have become all yours.In truth these words have no lying, no deceit. Were you to jump right out of your own selfhood,I would likely be there in your place, my dear."
