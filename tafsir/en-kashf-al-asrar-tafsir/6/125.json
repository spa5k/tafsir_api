  "text": "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to the submission.The mark of this expansion is that at three moments He throws three lights into the heart of the servant: the light of intellect at the beginning, the light of learning in the middle, and the light of recognition at the end. Then, with the sum total of these lights, all his difficulties are solved and he begins to see something of the Unseen. MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdBe wary of the perspicacity of the man of faith, for he gazes with the light of God.\ufffdWith the light of the beginning he knows his own defects, with the light of the middle he rec- ognizes his own loss, and with the light of the end he perceives his own nonbeing. With the light of the beginning he escapes from associationism, with the light of the middle he escapes from op- position, and with the light of the end he escapes from himself.Disown yourself, for what harms you is you.Don't talk about stars, for your heaven is you."
