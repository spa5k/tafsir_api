Keep them away from you so that we may have faith in you.\ufffdGod's Messenger desired eagerly for them to have faith, which is why God said, \ufffdPerhapsthou art consuming thyself with grief that they do not have faith in this talk\ufffd [18:6].One narrative has reported that God's Messenger sent ʿUmar with a message to these poor men, telling them to come less often for a few days so that perhaps those people would have faith. ʿUmar had not taken three steps before Gabriel came and brought this verse-\ufffdAnd drive not away! O MuḤammad, do not drive them away, for I have not driven them away. Do not caress those whom I have not called.\ufffdYes, those accepted by the Presence are one thing, those driven away by severance something else! Those poor men were the ones called by And God invites to the abode of peace [10:25], and those estranged ones were the ones driven away by Slink into it, and do not talk to Me! [23:108].God's Messenger called ʿUmar back. The unbelievers returned and said, \ufffdIf you can, at least give us a turn one day and them a turn another day, and then we may have faith in you.\ufffd God's Messenger aspired to set these turns as they wanted. Gabriel came and brought this verse: \ufffdAnd keep thy soul patient with those who supplicate their Lord [18:28]. Be with them, for I am with them. You should want them, for I want them.\ufffdWhen the unbelievers despaired of his setting down turns day by day, they returned and said, \ufffdIf you do not set down turns, we allow that. We will sit along with them for a time, and you look at us, not at them. You show respect to us, and then we will have faith in you.\ufffdMuṣṬafā called ʿUmar and sent him to the poor men to make their hearts happy and to seek their heart's approval for this so that perhaps those unbelievers would have faith."
