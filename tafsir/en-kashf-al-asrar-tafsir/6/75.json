  "text": "So also We were showing Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth, that he might be one of those with certainty. When night darkened over him, he saw a star. He said, \ufffdThis is my Lord.\ufffd When it set he said, \ufffdI love not those that set.\ufffd... Then when he saw the sun rising, he said, \ufffdThis is my Lord, this is greater.\ufffd When it set he said, \ufffdO my people, I am quit of what you associate. Surely I have turned my face toward Him who originatedthe heavens and the earth, unswerving, and I am not of the associaters.\ufffdFirst He showed him the dominion of heaven and earth so that he would derive evidence of the exis- tence of the Artisan by way of inference. He looked at the stars and said, \ufffdThis is my Lord,\ufffd that is, \ufffdevidence of my Lord, for my Lord has no beginning or end, but this has set.\ufffd He said, \ufffdI love not those that set.\ufffd At last the beauty of the Haqiqah showed its face to him. By means of inference and proofs he went back to witnessing and face-to-face vision. He turned away from everything and said, \ufffdSurely they are an enemy to me, save the Lord of the Worlds\ufffd [26:77]. He said to Gabriel, \ufffdAs for turning toward you, no.\ufffd First he was like a knower, then he became like a recognizer.WāsiṬī said, \ufffdThe world's creatures are going to Him, but the recognizers are coming from Him.\ufffdHe also said, \ufffdIf someone says, 'I recognized God through the evidence,' ask him how he recognized the evidence.'\ufffdTrue, at the beginning there is no escape from evidence, as was the beginning of Abraham's path. All that evidence came into Abraham's path-the star, the moon, the sun. When he reached each piece of evidence, he would cling to it and say, \ufffdThis is my Lord.\ufffd When he passed beyond the degrees of the evidence, he saw the beauty of tawḤīd with the eye of face-to-face vision. He said, \ufffdO my people, I am quit of what you associate,\ufffd that is, I am quit of inference from the crea- tures to the Creator, for there is no evidence for Him save Himself.This is the same as that great one of the religion said: \ufffdI recognized God through God, and I recognized that which is beneath God through God's light."
