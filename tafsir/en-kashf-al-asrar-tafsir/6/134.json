They asked him, \ufffdWhy are you limping?\ufffd He said, \ufffdTomorrow I am going to the thorn-field.\ufffdThey said, \ufffdThen tomorrow!\ufffdHe said, \ufffdTake tomorrow as come, take this curtain as torn, and take the disgrace as arrived!\ufffdHow long making the abode of delusion an abode of joy?How long making the abode of flight an abode of lodging? [DS 182]O chevalier! The life of this world is wind-as soon as you look, it's gone. This world is like a mad man's laughter and a drunkard's weeping. The mad man laughs without happiness, and the drunkard weeps without grief. This world is like ice placed in the sun, and it passes in anguish. Or it is like a sugar cube put in the mouth, and it falls apart. Yes, the taste is so sweet, but the body melts away. As soon as you put it in your mouth, it melts. This world is a pleasant gazing place, a verdant disclosure, but as soon as you look, it passes. As soon as you bind your heart to it, it goes.\ufffdIf not for death, every man would claim lordhood.\ufffd Were it not for the abasement of death, from all sides of the world would rise up the call, \ufffdI am your Lord the most high\ufffd [79:24].You will see all these seats of honor emptied of chiefs. They bloomed like roses on the wall, then they dropped from the wall and slept in the dust. Why do you not take heed and think about your final end? The Lord of the Worlds says, \ufffdYou shall surely know whose outcome shall be the Abode\ufffd [6:135]. Yes, know what this world will reach and who shall have the house of triumph and foreverness! See how the poor and broken will be brought on steeds of generosity, and the chieftains empty of meaning will be driven by whips of severity!Wait-you'll find those you see as parts today are wholes.Wait-you'll see those you see as thorns today are roses.The exalted ones who'll be good fortune's garden there- don't take and treat them like lowly thorns here.The rosebush that yesterday's cruelty makes appear to you like firewood- wait till the hand of Spring's justice brings it to display! [DS 185]"
