It is I who am powerful to perfection, I who am bounteous with bestowal, I who am the beautiful doing, beautiful- wanting friend and companion.\ufffdIn the reports of David has come this: \ufffdO David! Ask the earth-dwellers why they do not be- come friends with Me, for I am worthy of friendship. I am the Lord with munificence and without niggardliness, with knowledge and without ignorance, with patience and without incapacity. There is no change in My attributes and no alteration in My words. I am the bestower upon the servants and vast in mercy. I have never turned back from bounty and generosity. In the Beginningless I wrote mercy toward them against Myself and burned the incense of love. I lit up their hearts with the light of recognition.\ufffd The tongue of the servants' state says in the tune of thanksgiving,\ufffdLove for Your Essence, my God, is the belief of the friends,remembering Your description, O Lord, dispels the grief of the grieving.The cash in hand of the servants is the treasure-house of Your bounty, so the hopeful keep on sewing the purse of hope.\ufffd\ufffdO David, if those who turn away from Me knew how I wait for them and how I yearn to put aside their acts of disobedience, they would die in yearning for Me and would cut off all their ties be- cause of love for Me. O David, this is what I desire for those who turn away from Me. How then is My desire for those who turn toward Me?!\ufffdO David! I give blessings, and they show gratitude to others. I fend off trial, and they seethat from others. Their shelter is My Presence, and they take shelter in others. All right, let them go, let them flee, and they will return at last.\ufffdYou also have brightness from Me-you'll keep wandering, then you'll come to Me.\ufffdO David! I am the friend of him who befriends Me. I am the companion of him who takes Me as companion."
