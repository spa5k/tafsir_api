  "text": "And he who brought truthfulness and he who assented to it, those are the godwary.Know that truthfulness [ṣidq] means truthfulness [rāstī]. There is truthfulness in four things: words, promises, resoluteness, and deeds. Truthfulness in words is what the Real says about MuṣṬafā: \ufffdAnd he who brought truthfulness.\ufffd Truthfulness in promises is what He says about Ishmael the prophet: \ufffdSurely he was truthful in the promise\ufffd [19:54]. Truthfulness in resoluteness is what He says about the Messenger's companions: \ufffdMen truthful in the covenant they made with God\ufffd [33:23]. Truthfulness in deeds is what He says about the faithful: \ufffdIt is they who have been truthful\ufffd [2:177].When these traits are brought together in someone, he is called \ufffdsincerely truthful.\ufffd Abraham was in this station, for the Exalted Lord said concerning him, \ufffdSurely he was sincerely truthful, a prophet\ufffd [19:41].MuṣṬafā was asked, \ufffdWhat is the perfection of the religion?\ufffd He said, \ufffdSpeaking with truth and acting with truthfulness.\ufffd A pir was asked, \ufffdWhat is truthfulness?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdYou do what you say, you have what you show, and you are whence you call out.\ufffd Truthfulness in words is that the servant in whispered prayer with the Real seeks truthfulness from himself. If his face is turned toward this world in the state when he says, \ufffdSurely I have turned my face toward Him who originated the heavens and the earth\ufffd [6:79], then that is a lie. When he says, \ufffdThee alone we worship\ufffd [1:5], if he is in bondage to this world and to appetite, then he has spoken a lie, for a man is the servant of that to which he is in bondage. This is why MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdMiserable is the servant of dirhams, miserable the servant of dinars!\ufffd He called him the servant of gold and silver because he is in bondage to gold and silver. The servant must be free of this world and appetites as well as himself if servanthood to the Real is to be set right for him.Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī said, \ufffdThe Real made me stand before Him in one thousand standing places. In each standing place He offered me the empire. I said, 'I do not desire it.'\ufffdHe said to me in the last standing place, 'O Abū Yazīd, what do you desire?' \ufffdI said, 'I desire not to desire."
