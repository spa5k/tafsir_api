  "text": "Surely We have sent the Book down to thee with the truth, so worship God, purifying the religion for Him.\ufffdO Mu拷바mmad, We sent this Qur'an down to you so that you may call the lost to the road of salva- tion, bring the deprived from the intrusion of deprivation to the comfort of union, bring the suffer- ing from the darkness of misfortune to the courtyard of prosperity, complete the noble character traits with this Qur'an, and arrange the Shariah in accordance with it. O Mu拷바mmad, when a place does not have the light of your creed, all will be the darkness of associationism. When a place does not have the intimacy of your Shariah, all will be the intrusion of doubt. O Mu拷바mmad, We have joined your exalted good fortune and your eminent messengerhood to the Endless.\ufffdSo worship God, purifying the religion for Him. Now belong fully to Me, turning your secret core toward Me, your heart lifted up from all others, released from the bonds of yourself and your own controlling power.\ufffdWith this command, the Messenger became so courteous that Gabriel came and said, \ufffdO Mu拷바mmad! Have you chosen to be a prophet king, or a prophet servant?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO Lord, I want servanthood. I do not want kingship, for kingship is entirely turned over to You, and servanthood is entirely turned over to me. I have no refuge but Your gentleness and no shelter but Your exalted presence. If I were to choose kingship, I would stay with the king- ship and boast of my kingship. Rather, I choose servanthood so that I may be under Your kingship and boast of Your kingship.\ufffdThis is why he said, \ufffd'I am the master of Adam's children without boasting': The boasting that I have is of the Friend, not of other than Him. When someone boasts, he boasts of something that is above him, not below him. In the two worlds, no one is above me except Him. If I were to boast of other than Him, I would have looked at other than Him and left aside the command, 'So worship God, purifying!' But there is no command to leave it aside, and no stipulation to look at other than Him. Hence there is no boasting in other than Him.\ufffdYou name me \ufffdmaster,\ufffd but my master is the one You know.If You examine my heart, You will see Your remembrance in my breast."
