  "text": "If he is one of those brought near, then repose and ease and a garden of bliss.One of the great ones of the religion said that repose and ease will be both in this world and in the afterworld. The repose is in this world and the ease will be in the afterworld. The repose is that He adorns the heart of the faithful servants with His gaze so that they will discern truth from falsehood. Then He makes them wide in knowledge so that they will find there the vision of His power. Then He makes them seeing so that they will have the light to see His favors. He makes them hearing so that they will listen to the beginningless advice. He makes them pure so that they will seek only His companionship. He makes them happy with the fragrance of union so that their love for the Friend will grow. He makes them bright with His light so that they will gaze from Him to Him. He scours them with the file of solicitude so that they will see Him wherever they look.When the servants go to the house of felicity with these attributes, they will see the ease of generosity. The breeze of intimacy will be blowing, the seat of approval will be set up under the tree of finding, the carpet of intimacy will be spread, the candle of compassion lit. The servants will sit like kings and the beginningless Friend will lift up the curtain, greeting their ears with \ufffdpeace\ufffd and showing the vision of the Possessor of Majesty:"
