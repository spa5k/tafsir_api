  "text": "Uplifter of degrees is He, Possessor of the Throne.He uplifts the degrees of the disobedient to salvation, of the obedient to rewards, of the possessors of needs to sufficiency, of the friends to charismatic gifts, and of the recognizers to states of watch- fulness and encounter. He lifts up the degrees of the servants. He keeps each in a station and gives to each of them what is suitable for him. To the disobedient He gives salvation, to the obedient rewards, to the requesters sufficiencies, to the friends charismatic gifts, to the recognizers states of watchfulness and encounter.The degrees of the faithful and the friends are first today and then tomorrow. Today they are in knowledge and faith, as He says, \ufffdHe will lift up in degrees those among you who have faith and those who have been given knowledge\ufffd [58:11]. Tomorrow they will be in the garden of ap- proval with repose and ease [56:89] in the neighborhood of the All-Merciful, as He says: \ufffdThey are degrees with God\ufffd [3:163].As for the degrees of the folk of form tomorrow in paradise, they are one thing, and the degrees of the folk of attributes are another thing, for the folk of form are one thing and the folk of attributes are another. The folk of form are in the valley of dispersion, the folk of attributes in the center point of togetherness. \ufffdThe faithful indeed are siblings\ufffd [49:10]; this is in the world of form. As for what MuṣṬafā said, \ufffdThe faithful are like one soul,\ufffd that is in the world of attributes.One of the nomad leaders came before MuṣṬafā and asked, \ufffdWhat has been put away for us in paradise, and how high will be our degrees?\ufffd This man was one of the folk of form.God's Messenger replied, \ufffd'Therein are rivers of water unstaling' [47:15], and therein are such and such and so on.\ufffd He counted out the flowing water, the roasted fowl, the various sorts of fruit, just as the Qur'an speaks of them.Someone else, one of the folk of attributes, asked him about this meaning. God's Messenger knew he was a man of attributes, not a man of form, so he said, \ufffdWithin it are what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what has never passed into the heart of any mortal."
