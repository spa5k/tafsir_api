  "text": "\" Oh, my grief for Joseph! \" And his eyes turned white because of the sorrow that he was suppressing.Revelation came from the Compeller of all engendered beings: \" O Jacob! You grieve so much for him, but you do not grieve for what you are missing of Me by being busy with grief for him! \" O Jacob, how long this sorrow and regret at separation from Joseph? How long will you suffer grief and coldly sigh? Do you not suffer grief that you are held back from Me while busy with him?\" With two kiblahs you can't walk straight on the road of tawḤīd- either the Friend's approval, or your own caprice. [DS 488]\" O Jacob! Be careful not to pass Joseph's name over your tongue any more, or I will remove your name from the register of the prophets. \"The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" Jacob's remembrance of Joseph was the seed of heartache, and Joseph's remembrance of Jacob was the seed of ease. Since Jacob had all that rebuke for remem- bering Joseph, everything other than remembering God is loss. It is said that remembering the Friend is like the spirit. Look more carefully: remembering the Friend is the spirit itself! \"When Jacob saw the harshness of the Real's rebuke, he no longer mentioned Joseph's name. Then the mercy and gentleness of the Exalted Threshold gave this command to Gabriel: \" O Ga- briel, go to Jacob and remind him of Joseph. \" Gabriel came and mentioned Joseph's name. Jacob sighed. Revelation came from the Real: \" O Jacob, I know what is beneath your moaning. By My exaltedness, were he dead, I would resurrect him because of the beauty of your loyalty. \"And his eyes turned white because of the sorrow that he was suppressing. Abū ʿAlī al-Daqqāq said, \" Jacob wept because of a created thing, so his eyesight went. David wept more than Jacob, but his eyesight did not go, because his weeping was for the sake of his Lord. \"Weeping for the Real is of two sorts: weeping from the eyes and weeping from the heart. Weeping from the eyes is the weeping of repenters in fear of God; they weep at seeing their own disobedience."
