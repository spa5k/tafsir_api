  "text": "When Joseph said to his father, \" O my father, surely I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I saw them prostrating to me. \"Ibn ʿAbbās said, \" The eleven stars allude to the eleven brothers. \" God is saying, \" The stars are bright by themselves and people take to the road by them, \" which is in His words, \" By the stars they are guided \" [16:16]. \" In the same way Joseph's brothers had the brightness of prophecy, and within them was found the guidance of the people. \"Their treachery toward their brother and their envy toward him are minor sins of the sort that occur for prophets. The wisdom in this is that the world's folk may come to know that the faultless is God, who is one and unique, and all other things have faults. In this meaning they have sung,I am the faulty and my Lord is pure-my faultiness is evidence of the Pure.It was said to Ḥasan, \" Does the man of faith have envy? \"He said, \" What has made you forget the sons of Jacob? \"Someone may say that Joseph was an immature child when he saw this dream, and it is known in the Shariah that no rulings apply to the act of a child. Since his act has no ruling, how can his dream have a ruling? The answer is that if the child's act is achieved by his own intention and aim, it can be attributed to his susceptibility to shortcoming and defect. But a dream is a divine showing, and in that children and adults are the same."
