  "text": "Thou wouldst have thought them awake, but they were sleeping. And We turned them now to the right, now to the left. And their dog was stretching its paws at the doorstep. Hadst thou looked down upon them, surely thou wouldst have turned away from them fleeing, and thou wouldst have been filled with terror from them.When you look at their outwardness, you see them busy in the playing field of deeds. When you look at their secret cores, you see them detached in the garden of the gentleness of the Possessor of Majesty. Outwardly active, inwardly they gaze on the gentleness of the Beginningless. With Thee alone we worship [1:5] they have bound the belt of struggle, and with And Thee alone we ask for help [1:5] they have placed the crown of contemplation on their heads. On the inside they wear the undershirt of surrender, and on the outside they have covered themselves with the caftan of deeds. Their activity conforms to the command, and their vision conforms to the decree.A pir was asked, \ufffdFaith without deeds is incomplete, but the Companions of the Cave had no deeds, for when they began to travel, they immediately slept.\ufffdThe pir answered, \ufffdWhich deed is greater than what the Exalted Lord said about them-when they stood up [18:14]?\ufffdIn the tongue of the folk of allusion the meaning is that they stood back from themselves. The outcome of the servants from their deeds comes down to their standing back from themselves. When they stand back from themselves, they reach the Real. The intermediary disappears and He exercises His determination over them, doing their work Himself, as He said concerning the cheva- liers, \ufffdAnd We turned them now to the right, now to the left.\ufffd In other words, \ufffdWe turned them be- tween the states of annihilation and subsistence, unveiling and veiling, disclosure and curtaining.\ufffd The Pir of the Tariqah spoke a few words alluding to the levels of these states and the intima-tions of these realities: \ufffdO God, how much will You be hidden, how much apparent? For my heart is bewildered, the spirit distracted. How long this curtaining and self-disclosing? When at last will there be the everlasting self-disclosure? O God, how long will You call and drive away? I have melted in wanting the day in which You stay."
