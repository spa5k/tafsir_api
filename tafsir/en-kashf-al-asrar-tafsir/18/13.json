Surely they were chevaliers who had faith in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.Here we have great eminence, complete honor, and infinite caresses placed on these Companions of the Cave by the Lord of the Worlds, for He called them \ufffdchevaliers.\ufffd He said, \ufffdSurely they were chevaliers.\ufffd He bestowed on them the same honor that He gave to His bosom friend Abra- ham, whom He called a chevalier: \ufffdThey said, 'We heard a chevalier mention them; he is called Abraham'\ufffd [21:60]. And concerning Yūshaʿ ibn Nūn He said, \ufffdWhen Moses said to his chevalier\ufffd [18:60]. About Joseph the sincerely truthful He said, \ufffdThe governor's wife has been trying to se- duce her chevalier\ufffd [12:30].The conduct and Tariqah of the chevaliers is what MuṣṬafā said to ʿAlī: \ufffdO ʿAlī, the chevalier is straight-speaking, loyal, discharger of trusts, ever-merciful in the heart, protector of the poor, full of bestowal, caresser of guests, beautiful-doer, and possessor of shame.\ufffdIt has been said that the chief of all the chevaliers was Joseph the sincerely truthful, who saw from his brothers the various trials that he saw, but, when he had them in his own hand, he said to them, \ufffdNo reproof is upon you today\ufffd [12:92].It has been reported that the Messenger was seated when someone got up and asked for help. The Messenger turned toward his companions and said, \ufffdBe a chevalier toward him.\ufffd ʿAlī got up and went. When he returned, he had one dinar, five dirhams, and a loaf of bread. The Messenger said, \ufffdO ʿAlī, what is this state?\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO Messenger of God! When the questioner asked, it occurred to my heart to give him a loaf. Then it came into my heart that I should give him five dirhams. Then it passed through my mind that I should give him one dinar. Now I do not consider it permissible not to do what has come into my mind and passed into my heart.\ufffdThe Messenger said, \ufffdThere is no chevalier but ʿAlī!\ufffdAnd We increased them in guidance. When there is a robe of honor built on the perfect good fortune of love, within which is the explication of beginningless solicitude, it should not be less than what was said about those chevaliers: \ufffdAnd We increased them in guidance.\ufffd"
