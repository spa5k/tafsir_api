  "text": "When the chevaliers took refuge in the cave and said, \ufffdOur Lord, give us mercy from Thee and furnish us with right conduct in our affair.\ufffdIt was said to them, \ufffdGo into this cave and sleep sweetly. Put down your heads on the pillow of security, for We will take sleep from you in place of the worship of the world's folk.\ufffdListen to a beautiful, subtle point: The Exalted Lord made a cave appear to them in that moun- tain, and when the faithful servants leave this world He makes the four walls of the grave their cave. Just as He gave them security from enemies in that cave, so also He will give the faithful servants security from Satan in the grave, saying, \ufffdFear not and grieve not\ufffd [41:30]. In that cave He showed mercy to them: Your Lord will unfold for you of His mercy [18:16]. In the same way, He will show mercy to the faithful in this cave of the grave: Repose and ease and a garden of bliss [56:89]. Just as He made that cave vast for them, for He says, \ufffdwhile they were in a broad space in it\ufffd [18:17], so also He will make this grave vast for the faithful servant with wholesome deeds. He says, \ufffdWhoever does wholesome deeds-for their own souls they are making provision\ufffd [30:44]. And a sound report has come, \ufffdHis grave will be made spacious for him.\ufffd Just as He opened up the top of the cave for them so that fresh air and the breeze of the morning wind would not be cut off from them, so also He will open up a door from paradise to the faithful servants' garden-plots so that a sweet-smelling breeze will pass over them from the direction of the Gardens of Eden and keep their beds sweet."
