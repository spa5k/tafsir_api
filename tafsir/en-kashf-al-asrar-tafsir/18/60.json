  "text": "When Moses said to his chevalier, \ufffdI will continue on until I reach the meeting place of the two seas.\ufffdMoses had four journeys: One was the journey of flight, as God says recounting from Moses, \ufffdSo I fled from you when I was afraid of you\ufffd [26:21]. The second was the journey of seeking on the night of the fire. That is His words, \ufffdHe was called from the right bank of the watercourse\ufffd [28:30]. Third was the journey of revelry: \ufffdWhen Moses came to Our appointed time\ufffd [7:143]. Fourth was the journey of toil: \ufffdWe have certainly met with weariness on this journey of ours\ufffd [18:62].His journey of flight was at the beginning of the work. He fled from the enemy and turned his face toward Midian, having killed the Egyptian man, as the Exalted Lord says: \ufffdSo Moses struck him and gave him the decree\ufffd [28:15]. When there is solicitude, how can prosperity and victory be ended? Since God had solicitude toward Moses' work, He excused him for that killing. He said, \ufffdMoses struck him and My decree reached him.\ufffd Then He said, \ufffdMoses had no sin in that. The sin belonged to the devil and the act was from the devil: He said, 'This is the work of Satan' [28:15].\ufffd In the same way, He will excuse the faithful servant with His bounty and convey His pardon to him. He says, \ufffdSatan made them slip for something they had earned, but God has surely pardoned them\ufffd [3:155]. God overlooked their sin. It was Satanic disquiet and the devil's work.The second was the journey of seeking on the night of the fire. Moses set out seeking fire. What sort of fire was it, for it placed the whole world on fire! Wherever talk of Moses' fire goes, the whole world takes on the scent of passion because of its turmoil. Moses set off in search of fire and found light. These chevaliers set off in search of light and find fire. If the sweetness of listen- ing to the Real's speech without intermediary reached Moses, what wonder is it that His friends catch a scent of that? If the fire of Moses was apparent, the fire of these chevaliers is hidden. If the fire of Moses was in a tree, the fire of these chevaliers is in the spirit."
