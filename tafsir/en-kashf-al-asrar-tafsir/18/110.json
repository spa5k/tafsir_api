  "text": "Whoever hopes for the encounter with his Lord, let him do wholesome deeds.Sahl said, \ufffdThe wholesome deed is a deed delimited by the Sunnah.\ufffdIt has also been said, \ufffdThe wholesome deed is the one toward which the soul has no regard and within which there is no seeking of reward or recompense.\ufffdIt has also been said, \ufffdHere the wholesome deed is believing in the permissibility of vision and waiting for its time.\ufffdWhenever someone hopes for the vision of God, let him believe in his heart that God is seeable in face-to-face vision as a hidden mystery and an everlasting love. Whenever someone seeks thevision of God, he is promised that one day he will reach it: Whoever hopes for the encounter with his Lord, God's term is coming [29:5]. He is expecting a great thing and has a tremendous hope. His aspiration has reached such a high place that he hopes for the vision of God. Were there not this hope, what would be the worth of paradise with all its sweetness? Were there not this promise of vision, why would service rise up from the servant's heart?Everyone has a desire after which he runs, and the recognizer is waiting for the time of vision. People are all passionate for life, so death for them is difficult. The recognizer hurries to death in hope of vision.What harm if you suffer for a yearso long as you see the Friend one day in vision."
