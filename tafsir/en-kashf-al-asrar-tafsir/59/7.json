Read the tablet that he writes, learn servanthood from his character traits, take seeking from his aspiration, put his Sunnah to work, walk behind him in all states. The final goal of the traveling of the servants and the perfection of their states is My love, and My love lies in following the Sunnah and conduct of your prophet. Whoever walks straight in his tracks is in reality My friend. Say: 'If you love God, follow me; God will love you' [3:31].\ufffd The faithful Companions came back to being loyal to the beginningless Covenant and kept their feet straight in following MuṣṬafā's Sunnah. They put to work truthfulness in acts, and the Lord of the Worlds praised them for their truthfulness:"
