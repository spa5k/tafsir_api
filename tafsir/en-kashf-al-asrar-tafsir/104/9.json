  "text": "Roaring over the hearts, coming down on them in outstretched columns. In the tongue of the folk of allusion and in keeping with the tasting of the folk of understanding, the lit-up fire of God is what the Pir of the Tariqah said: “It is a fire set by the limpidness of love that spoils the delights of life and strips away solace. Nothing can hold it back short of the encounter.” This is the state of that chevalier of the Tariqah, Ḥallāj, who said, “They struck the lit-up fire of God in my inwardness seventy years before it burned.” Then the kindling of the present moment of “I am the Real” sent out sparks. The sparks fell on that burnt one and took flame, so nothing was left of him but sparks. O assemblies of the Muslims! Where is a heart burnt by the lit up fire of God so that at the time of dawn a fire may catch in it from the flint of “God descends” and they may say, “Is this the one burned by the fire of love?” With the tongue of his state the lover says, “I keep on throwing the spirit-incense on the fire of passion. The spirit is Your servant-it is not that I am generous. When passion for You has burned away my spirit, I will contrive to find a hundred spirits more.”"
