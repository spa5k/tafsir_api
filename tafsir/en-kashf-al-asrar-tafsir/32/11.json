  "text": "Say: “The angel of death, who has been entrusted with you, will make you die.” Were it not for the hearts' heedlessness, the taking of their spirits would not have been turned over to the angel of death. Since they were heedless of witnessing the realities, He addressed them in the measure of their understandings and attached their hearts to others. He addresses each of them in the measure of what their strength and weakness can carry. This address is in the measure of the understanding of the lords of customs and habits, who in their heedlessness do not find the road to the Real's realities and do not perceive the subtle secrets of the Beginningless, so they are given to drink in the measure of their capacities. Otherwise, in respect of the Haqiqah and what is addressed to the chevaliers of the Tariqah, the angel of death sifts the dust of the empire, seeking mines in the dust, and gems in the mines. “People are mines, like mines of gold and silver.” He is sifting the dust to see what you have nurtured within it-a carnelian, a ruby, a turquoise. Or no-you are bitumen, or tar, or pebbles. Are you a vile word [14:26] or a goodly word [14:24]? He sifts the dust, he twists the veins, he breaks the bones. How can his hands touch the pure deposit? What does he have to do with that? For he did not put it there that he should take it back. God takes the souls at the time of their death [39:42]. Khayr Nassāj was ill. The angel of death wanted to take his spirit. At the time of prayer, the muezzin said, “God is greater, God is greater.” Khayr said, “O Angel of Death! Wait until I per- form the obligatory night prayer. Otherwise, I will miss out on this command, but I will not miss out on your command.” When he performed the prayer, he put down his head in prostration and said, “O God, on the day when You placed this deposit, the angel of death was not there to intrude. What harm if today You take me without his intrusion?” O Lord, if You annihilate me with the sword of friendship, the angel of death will have nothing to do with me.  Whoever drinks the draft of Your passion from Your cup will know the pain of craving when none is left. [DS 211] It is a sound report that on the day of the compact at the covenant of Yes indeed [7:172], when the specks of the prophets were pulled out from Adam's loins and presented to his overarching vision, he saw that David's lifespan was short. He said, “Lord God, let me give forty years of my lifespan to him,” and the Exalted Lord accepted that. Then, at the end of Adam's life, when the angel of death came and told him to surrender his spirit, he said, “My lifespan is my traveling on the road. If I surrender my spirit, what will happen with the road not traveled?” The angel of death said, “You gave away the lifespan, so the road will remain not completely traveled.” Adam said, “Let me take it back, for I am the father, and I have need of the lifespan, for I can- not go on the road without it.” The report has come, “Adam refused, so his offspring refuse.” When the period passed, the angel of death said, “Adam, surrender your spirit.” Adam said, “I will not surrender it to you, for you did not put it there that you should take it away. On the day that the exalted majesty of I have blown into him of My spirit [15:29] came into my frame, where were you? Today if it is wanted back, what are you doing in the midst?” The Lord of the Worlds commanded, “O Adam, stop arguing! O Azrael, you go away and take away your intrusion! O pure spirit at ease with My gentleness and at rest in My love! O serene soul, return to thy Lord, approving, approved!” [89:27-28]."
