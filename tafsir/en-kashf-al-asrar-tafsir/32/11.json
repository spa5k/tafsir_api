  "text": "Say: \ufffdThe angel of death, who has been entrusted with you, will make you die.\ufffdWere it not for the hearts' heedlessness, the taking of their spirits would not have been turned over to the angel of death. Since they were heedless of witnessing the realities, He addressed them in the measure of their understandings and attached their hearts to others. He addresses each of them in the measure of what their strength and weakness can carry.This address is in the measure of the understanding of the lords of customs and habits, who in their heedlessness do not find the road to the Real's realities and do not perceive the subtle secrets of the Beginningless, so they are given to drink in the measure of their capacities. Otherwise, in respect of the Haqiqah and what is addressed to the chevaliers of the Tariqah, the angel of death sifts the dust of the empire, seeking mines in the dust, and gems in the mines. \ufffdPeople are mines, like mines of gold and silver.\ufffd He is sifting the dust to see what you have nurtured within it-a carnelian, a ruby, a turquoise. Or no-you are bitumen, or tar, or pebbles. Are you a vile word [14:26] or a goodly word [14:24]? He sifts the dust, he twists the veins, he breaks the bones. How can his hands touch the pure deposit? What does he have to do with that? For he did not put it there that he should take it back. God takes the souls at the time of their death [39:42].Khayr NassƒÅj was ill. The angel of death wanted to take his spirit. At the time of prayer, the muezzin said, \ufffdGod is greater, God is greater.\ufffd Khayr said, \ufffdO Angel of Death! Wait until I per- form the obligatory night prayer. Otherwise, I will miss out on this command, but I will not miss out on your command.\ufffd When he performed the prayer, he put down his head in prostration and said, \ufffdO God, on the day when You placed this deposit, the angel of death was not there to intrude. What harm if today You take me without his intrusion?\ufffdO Lord, if You annihilate me with the sword of friendship, the angel of death will have nothing to do with me."
