  "text": "Those who have faith and whose hearts are serene in the remembrance of God.The hearts of one group are serene in the remembrance of God, and the hearts of another group are serene in God's remembrance of them: And surely God's remembrance is greater [29:45].In the tongue of the folk of allusion, this verse reports about two people, one the desirer and the other the desired. One keeps his hours immersed in the remembrance of the tongue, sometimes prayer, sometimes glorification, and sometimes recitation of the Qur'an. The other is joyful with the remembrance of the Real in the midst of the spirit because he is drowned in the ocean of face- to-face vision. He does not attend to the remembrance of the tongue, but keeps on saying, \" O God, as long as I remember Your remembrance, my spirit laments at all remembrance. As long as my heart is happy with Your apparentness, the happiness of the two worlds is but wind. \"The first travels on the road of the religion, kept in the bonds of his own remembrance, and it is said to him, \" Preserve the remembrance and give ear to the commands and prohibitions. \" The other is on the carpet of proximity, snatched away from causes and creation and singled out for the divine attraction, and it is said to the remembrance, \" Give ear to him. \" This is just like one group hop- ing for paradise, while paradise itself is hoping for another group. That is in the Prophet's words, \" Surely the Garden yearns for four individuals: the one who fasts Ramadan, the one who recites the Qur'an, the one who protects the tongue, and the one who feeds the hungry. \" It has also been narrated that the Garden yearns for SalmƒÅn.The desirer's eyes have come upon this: \" Remember Me! \" [2:152]. The desired has been shown this: \" I will remember you \" [2:152]. The desired is seeking remembrance, and remem- brance is seeking the desired. The desirer is seeking the present moment, and the present moment is seeking the desired. The desirer is seeking the heart, and the heart is seeking the desired. The field of the desirer's gaze is the world of setting forth in the wrap of createdness, and the field of the desired's gaze is the air of unity and the space of solitariness."
