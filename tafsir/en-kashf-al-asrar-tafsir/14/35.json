  "text": "And when Abraham said, \ufffdMy Lord, make this land secure, and keep me and my sons away from worshiping idols.\ufffdIn this verse Abraham asked two things from the Real: First, Mecca's security from mastery by enemies, and second, the heart's security from domination by the ruling power of caprice. He said, \ufffdLord God, make this city of Mecca into a secure sanctuary far from the hand of any tyrant and free of fear for all the people.\ufffd The Lord of the Worlds responded to his supplication and made it into a blessed sanctuary and a place of security, as He says, \ufffd[And when We made the House] a place of gathering for the people, and a sanctuary\ufffd [2:125]. Never will the hand of any tyrant reach it; whoever goes into the sanctuary-whether Adamite or non-Adamite, wild prey or bird of the air-will have no fear.He asked for the heart's security in terms of allusion with his words, \ufffdKeep me and my sons away from worshiping idols.\ufffd Whenever something holds you back from the Real, that is your idol. Whenever your heart inclines and looks to something other than the Real, that is your caprice. The Exalted Lord says, \ufffdHast thou seen him who has taken his caprice as his god?\ufffd [25:43]. One person looks to property and trade, another to wife and children, another to position and respect. One person has remained in the bonds of venerating piety and self-restraint and has not taken a step beyond that. Another has made obedience and worship his kiblah-looking at it and leaning on it have become the veil of his road.The Lord of the Worlds says, \ufffdAnd repent all together to God, O you who have faith! Perhaps you will prosper [24:31]. O you who have faith, if you want Me to make your hearts the sanctuary of My gaze and to keep you secure from the veil of severance, turn your faces totally to Me and turn away from everything else!\ufffd Sometimes He calls to His road with the tongue of the artifacts to make people realize familiarity. Sometimes He calls to Himself with the tongue of unveiling to confirm friendship.He is saying: \ufffdTurn away from yourself and totally to Him so as to recognize what is right- fully due to Him."
