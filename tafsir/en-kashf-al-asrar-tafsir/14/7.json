If you give thanks for faith, I will increase you in beautiful doing. If you give thanks for beautiful doing, I will in- crease you in recognition. If you give thanks for recognition, I will increase you in union. If you give thanks for union, I will increase you in contemplation. If you give thanks for the gifts that I bestow upon you, I will increase you in the encounter I have promised you.\ufffdIt has been narrated that David said, \ufffdMy Lord, how should I give thanks to You, for my giving thanks is a renewal of Your favor toward me.\ufffdHe said, \ufffdO David, what you said now is giving thanks to Me.\ufffd"
