And be wary of God, whom you ask against one another, and of the wombs. Surely God is watcher over you.�O center point of human nature, O attribute of mortal nature, make godwariness your shelter and cling to it, for the life of the servants is through it and the deliverance of the travelers in it.�Godwariness is for the servant to make the commands of the Shariah into his shield so that the arrows of prohibition may not reach him. It has three levels: First, he takes refuge in the sentence of tawḤīd and avoids every associationism. Second he takes refuge in obedience and steps away from the path of disobedience. Third he takes refuge in caution and flees from ambiguity. Anyone who climbs these way stations of godwariness with truthfulness will inescapably reach deliver- ance, for the Qur'an gives this report: �God will deliver those who were godwary in their place of security; ugliness will not touch them, neither shall they sorrow� [39:61]. In another place He says, �Whosoever is wary of God, He will appoint a way out for him and He will provide for him from whence he never reckoned [65:2-3]. Whenever someone takes hold of godwariness, We will ease for him the road of deliverance from every suffering and We will send him provision from whence he has no hope.�It has been said that the sister of Bishr Ḥāfī went to see AḤmad Ḥanbal. She said, �O Imam of the Muslims! I work a spindle on the roof of my house. When the torch of the Tahirids passes by, it may happen that I join threads with the rays of that torch. Is this permissible or not?�AḤmad said, �First tell me who you are. Are you in a walkway of being able to tolerate such godwariness?�She said, �I am the sister of Bishr Ḥāfī.�AḤmad wept and said, �Godwariness like this is permissible only in the household of Bishr Ḥāfī! It is not worthy of you, so be careful not to do it, and Bishr Ḥāfī will be happy with you. Emulate your brother so that perhaps you may be like him."

As for those wrongdoers who skewer the livers of orphans and drink the blood of the indigent, He threatens them and warns them of a fearful punishment. He acts as the deputy of the helpless and disputes with the wrongdoers for their sake. For He is the companion of the weak, the helper of the despairing, the responder to the call of the distressed, and the listener to the voice of the grieved. He loves the servant who, when battered, incapable, and destitute, lets out a cold sigh, sheds warm tears, and lifts two empty hands toward Him, asking again to be excused.It has come in the traditions that a man was saying, �O Lord, O Lord! You have written, You have measured out, and You have decreed!� O God, all that was, is, and shall be is what You want, what You bring about, and what You write for the creatures. O God, none of this is outside Your predestination, nor does it happen without Your decree.A call came in his secret core, �That is tawḤīd. Where is servanthood?� What you have said is nothing but tawḤīd and is fit for My Godhood. What then is the mark of your servanthood?The man said, �O Lord, O Lord! Surely I have disobeyed, I have sinned, and I ask.� O God, what comes from me is fitting for me. O God, I have broken the covenant, I have no loyalty, I am disloyal and everything worse.What can I do about this story-I'm all artifice and color. I'm altogether too lame to walk on the straight road.Greed has made me all grasping claws,I'm all war with the Apportioner's apportioning.Surely those who eat the property of orphans wrongly. It is harsh to eat the wealth of orphans and foolishly crave their possessions. They say that once the marvel of the empire, the pure Jesus, was passing by a graveyard."

He invites the faithful to emigrate and praises those who do.The emigrants are of three sorts: One sort emigrates for the sake of this world. They under- take trade or the search for livelihood. Even though this is allowed in the Shariah, it is not clear where it will lay down its head at the end and what its outcome will be. MuṣṬafā said, �Love for this world is the beginning of every offense.� He also said, �Do not take a landed estate, lest youbecome eager for this world.�This sort of emigrant is always in suffering and hardship, caught in the hands of thieves and on the verge of destruction. Hoping to gain something that is allowed, he leaves aside something obligatory. Then he burns, and he loses the basis for both. God says, �You desire the chance goods of this life, and God desires the afterworld� [8:67].The second sort are the renunciants. Their emigration is for the sake of the afterworld and their traveling goes by way of meanings. They pass over the way stations of obedient acts and tra- verse the stages of worship on the feet of aspiration. Sometimes they make the hajj, go off to battle, struggle, make pilgrimages, perform the prayers, remember God's name, and meditate on God's blessings. Concerning them God's Messenger said, �Travel! The solitary will be the preceders.�They said, �O Messenger of God! Who are the solitary?�He said, �The engrossed-those who are engrossed by the remembrance of God. Remem- brance has lifted away their loads, and they come forth unburdened on the Day of Resurrection.�The Exalted Lord says about them, �Whosoever desires the afterworld and strives after it with proper striving while having faith-those, their striving shall be thanked� [17:19].The third sort are the recognizers, whose emigration is for the sake of the Patron. They emi- grate within their own makeup. They emigrate inside the curtains of the soul until they reach the heart, they emigrate inside the curtains of the heart until they reach the spirit, and they emigrate inside the curtains of the spirit until they reach union with the Beloved."

In this secret whisper- ing, there is both need and joy. Today there is need, tomorrow joy; today suffering, tomorrow the treasure; today a heavy burden, tomorrow repose and ease [56:89]; today toil and work, tomorrow pleasure and the bazaar; today bowing and prostrating, tomorrow finding and witnessing.Part of the eminence of the prayer is that the Exalted Lord has mentioned it 102 times in the Qur'an and given it thirteen names: prayer, devotion, Qur'an, glorification, book, remembrance, bowing, prostration, praise, asking forgiveness, declaring greatness, beautiful deeds, and subsistent things.MuṣṬafā said, �The prayer is the miʿrāj of the person of faith.� He said, �The prayer is God's banquet in the earth.�The ulama of the past have said, �The prayer is the throne of the desirers, the pleasure of the recognizers, the means of approach of the sinners, and the scented garden of the renunciants.�They have also said, �The person performing the prayer has received seven generous bestow- als: guidance, sufficiency, expiation, mercy, proximity, degree, and forgiveness.�The first step in associationism is not to say the prayers, for the Exalted Lord will say, �'Whatbrought you into Saqar?' They will say, 'We were not of those who said the prayers'� [74:42-43].And He placed the name faith in the prayer, where He says, �But God would never leave your faith,� that is, your prayer, �to waste� [2:143]. He promises daily provision with prayer, where He says, �And command thy folk to the prayer, and be thou patient therein. We ask thee for no provi- sion. We shall provide for thee� [20:132].The number of obligatory prayers came as five in conformity with the roots of the Shari'ite rules. Concerning the roots of the Shari'ite rules MuṣṬafā said, �The submission is built on five.� The roots of the obligatory prayers are five prayers in one day and night. In other words, when the servant performs these five prayers with their stipulations and at their times, the Exalted Lord will give him the reward of all the roots of the Shari'ite rules.The guises of the prayer are four: standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting."

Whosoever does this, seeking God's approval, We shall give him a tremendous wage.The best deeds of the servants are the three things in this verse: charity, the honorable, and making things wholesome among the people. The good in this verse is not specified for one individual, but rather its profit reaches others. The wonder is not that you should open a door for yourself, the wonder and chivalry are that you should open a door to yourself for another.Pir Bū ʿAlī Siyāh said, �So what if you make yourself happy? The work is done by making someone else happy.�MuṣṬafā alluded to this: �The worst of men is he who eats alone.�As for charity, it is of three sorts: with possessions, with the body, and with the heart. Char- ity with possessions is giving comfort to the poor by expending blessings. Charity with the body is undertaking for them the duty of service. Charity with the heart is being loyal to the beauty of intention and the consolidation of aspiration. This is charity toward the poor.There is also charity toward the rich. It is that you act with munificence toward them and do not expose your need to them; you take back your hope from their charitable gifts and do not covet anything from them.When charity, the honorable, and making things wholesome come together in someone, from head to foot he becomes veneration itself, the oyster shell for the mysteries of lordhood, and he is accepted by those who bear witness to the divinity. His name is given out as �sincerely truthful,� and tomorrow he will be gathered up along with the sincerely truthful. This is the great wage that the Exalted Lord has promised: �We shall give him a tremendous wage.�"

Yes, he instills disquiet, for that is his job, and then, in the tracks of this disquieting, the Exalted Lord creates misguidance, for guidance and misguidance, felicity and wretchedness, come from God: Whomsoever God guides, he is guided, and whomsoever He misguides, you will not find for him a guiding friend [18:17]. Then He mentions the outcome, the end, the final issue, and the returning place of the two groups: About the misguided sort He says, �Their refuge is Ge- henna� [4:121], and about the guided sort He says, �We shall enter them into gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever and ever� [4:122]."

The cause is marriage and the lineage is kinship. Marriage is the cause of love, as God says, �He placed between you love and mercy� [30:21]. Lineage is assistance and strength, as has come in the report: �A man is many through his brothers.� When one of the relatives by lineage or one of the near ones by cause dies, that will be a wound on a person's heart and a pain in his spirit. The Lord of the Worlds places balm on the pain. After this suffering He commands consolation through the wealth of the person who passed away. Thus, just as pain came from his passing, so also balm comes from his wealth. This is the custom of the Lord with His friends: If He places suffering on them by prescribing the Law, after the suffering He makes a treasure appear with the attribute of alleviation.Shaykh al-Islām Anṣārī said, �How should I have known that suffering is the mother of happi- ness and that beneath one disappointment lie a thousand treasures? How should I have known that hope is the courier of union and that beneath the cloud of munificence despair is impossible? How should I have known that the Lovingly Kind is so forbearing that His gentleness and loving kind- ness to the sinner are beyond reckoning? How should I have known how servant-caressing is thePossessor of Majesty and how much joy His friends have in Him? How should I have known that what I seek is in the midst of the spirit, and that the exaltation of union with Him is my opening?�In my whole life one night at the time of dawn,the image of that comfort of the spirit came to me And asked, �How are you, wounded one?�I said, �In my passion for You, that is the first opening.�"

And God took Abraham as a bosom friend.In this verse the Lord of the Worlds, the God of the world's folk, the Enactor who knows the hid- den, praises the self-purifiers and shows that He is pleased with self-purification in deeds. The first person to dress the Kaabah of deeds in the cloak of self-purification was MuṣṬafā, who said, �Deeds are only through intentions.� Self-purification in deeds does the work of color in jewels. Just as a jewel without the cape of color is a worthless stone, so also deeds without self-purification is to knock oneself out without hitting the mark.Maʿrūf Karkhī used to beat himself with a whip and say, �O soul! Purify thyself and be de- livered!�It has been said that knowledge is the seed, deeds are planting, and self-purification is the water. The work is done by self-purification, salvation lies in self-purification, and endless felicity lies in self-purification, but self-purification itself is exalted and does not come down just any- where, nor does it show its face to just anyone. The Exalted Lord said, �It is one of My secrets that I deposit in the hearts of those whom I love among My servants.�There was a worshiper among the Children of Israel. He was told that in such-and-such a place there is a tree that people worship. For the sake of God and the zeal of the religion he became angry, left his place with a mattock over his shoulder, and went to dig up the tree by its roots. Iblis went into the road with the attributes of an old man. He asked him where he was going and he replied, �To that place to dig up the tree.�Iblis said, �Go, busy yourself with your worship, for this will not done by your hand.� Iblis struggled with him and fell, and the worshiper sat on his chest. Iblis said, �Let go of me and I will speak some beautiful words to you.� He let go of him, and Iblis said, �O worshiper, God has prophets. If this tree needs to be dug up, He will command a prophet to dig it up."

Faith by proof is to employ the evidence of intellects, and faith by vision is to reach the degrees of arrival.

Gazing with the eye of response on the Responder, gaz-ing with the eye of solitariness on the Solitary, gazing with the eye of presence on the Present, being near to God's nearness by being far from self, being present with His generosity by being absent from self. He-majestic is His majesty!-is not far from the strivers nor absent from the desirers. He says, �We are nearer to him than the jugular vein� [50:16].The Pir of the Tariqah said, �O Lord!

The Shariah is need, the Haqiqah joy. The Shariah is theouter pillars, the Haqiqah the inner pillars. The Shariah is not having evil, the Haqiqah is not hav- ing self.

They would have eaten everything that is their poison and done everything within which is their destruction.So, you should believe that the prophets are mercy and leaders for the world's folk. They are the best of the creatures and the chosen among mortal men. They are the callers at the top of the street of friendship and the cupbearers at the lip of the water of life.

When someone repents but does not expend the wealth left over after food, he is not a repenter.The precondition of repentance is that you detach your heart from all existent things and turn it toward the Real.

O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you and the men of you and the jinn of you were to ask from Me and I were to give every man among them what he asked for, that would diminish nothing from Me, except as the ocean is diminished when a needle is dipped into it once.�But if you disbelieve, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.

O is the call, you is the admonishment, who is the allusion, have faith is the bearing witness.

Beware of tormenting them, and do not rule over them by way of scheming and deceit. Do not be severe, and do not ask of them what the Shariah does not approve. On the contrary, live with them honorably.Consort with them honorably, that is, with the teachings of the religion and by modeling one's courtesy on the character traits of the submitted.3 Show them the road of the religion and religios- ity and teach them the courteous acts of being a Muslim and the Shariah.

Preserve the courteous acts of companionship when consorting with them and tolerate suffering from them, but do not place on them the burden of your service, making them suffer for you.Although outwardly and specifically He is talking about women, by way of allusion He is talking generally about all Muslims. He is saying, �Watch out so that you never see yourself as having a mandatory rightful due from, or an excellence over, any other Muslim. Do not ask those above you to serve you, and do not push yourself on those beneath you. Do not use force against the folk of weakness, but rather strive to show consideration and give comfort to them and seek proximity to them.�Revelation came to David: �O David, if you see someone broken in My road, or someone whose heart has been lost in My work, take care to serve him."

Self-exertion and self-determination are a difficult road, their domicile in ruins, their goal un- wholesome. Watch out! Jump away from the road of self-exertion and cling to surrender. Avoid self-determination and looking for reasons. Whatever the Shariah has declared forbidden, consider it forbidden-a consignment by the Desire, built upon the Will. If it had been permitted in place of forbidden, the same would be the case, for it would have been current in the holy Shariah and would have no cause or ambiguity. For He is the Real-majestic is His majesty! He does whatso- ever He wills [3:40] and decrees whatsoever He desires [5:1].

He said, �My heart becomes clouded, so I ask forgiveness from God seventy times a day.� Abū Bakr al-ṣiddīq said, �Would that I could witness that for which God's Messenger asked forgiveness.�The mark of the recognizers' great sins is that lassitude sometimes comes over them in the world of their own traveling, and thereby their innate disposition is overpowered by human attri- butes. Their life becomes susceptible to customs and habits, and the realities of their faith come to be mixed with the contaminants of personal motives and marks giving witness to their own shares. In this state of theirs, if a messenger of sound discipline, truthful poverty, and the joy of ecstasy does not come out to welcome them and take their hands, they will not emerge from the pit of their own selfhood.If you want to come out of the pit of status like a man,grab hold of the pearl-encrusted, musk-wafting chain. [DS 719]The great ones of the religion have said that as long as a man does not reach this place of danger and leave behind the station of lassitude, he will not become a pir of the Tariqah and will not be suited to take disciples. A man must have lost the road a thousand times and then returned to it if he is to bring someone who has lost the road back to the road. What is needed first is the road to the road, then the road is needed. Someone who has always been on the road knows the road, but he does not know the road to the road.

In the same way, the obedient person finds obedience from self-purification, not self-purification from obedience; he finds the cause from the meaning, not the meaning from the cause. O God, since finding You is before the seeking and the seeker, I am seeking because unsettledness has overpowered me. The seeker is seeking and the Sought is obtained before the seeking.

Any act of obedience without tawḤīd has no value or weight, and its outcome will be nothing but darkness and captivity. Any act of disobedience along with tawḤīd will yield nothing other than familiarity and brightness.TawḤīd is that you say that God is one and that you be one for Him. Saying one is the submit- ter's tawḤīd, and being one is the basis of the recognizer's tawḤīd. The submitter's tawḤīd drives away the devil, washes away sin, and opens up the heart. The recognizer's tawḤīd cuts away at- tachments, washes away the creatures, and brings forth the realities.The submitter's tawḤīd takes advice, opens the door, and gives fruit. The recognizer's tawḤīdeffaces the customs of human nature and burns away the veil of mortal nature so that the breezeof familiarity may blow, the beginningless reminder may arrive, and the friend may gaze upon the Friend.The submitter's tawḤīd is that you bear witness to God's one Essence, pure attributes, and beginningless names and marks. He is the God other than whom there is no god, the Creator of heaven and earth other than whom there is no enactor. No one has loyalty like Him in the whole cosmos. He is a Lord who is above all in measure, beyond all in Essence and attributes. From the Beginningless to the Endless He is the greatest Lord. When intellect holds that something is impossible, God has perfect power over it. His power makes no use of contrivance, and His self- standing has no change of state. In the kingdom He is safe from disappearance, and in Essence and attributes He is transcendent.You will never see any created thing without marks of deficiency and fault, but the Eternal Enactor is pure of deficiency, incomparable with fault, free of blights."

One is drunk with the wine of the grape, another with the wine of heedlessness, another with love for this world, another with the frivolity of the soul and self-love. This last is the most difficult, for self-love is the basis of idol-worship, the seed of estrangement, the curtain of ill fortune, and the root of every darkness.If you are martyred a hundred times a day in the path of Godyou will still be an idol-worshiper if you see yourself in the midst.When will you be the man to want the heart without caprice?When you will have the pain to see the body with contempt?

But He may indeed forgive him, for He says, �Surely God forgives the sins altogether� [39:53].When someone is drunk with the soul's arrogance and with pride and self-worship, his work is in peril. His basis is loss, his deeds damage him, and he dwells in the peril of being led on and deceived and the danger of everlasting separation.Or defiled-except for travelers on the road-until you have made the full ablution. If the religion were based on reasoning, then the greater ablution would be incumbent after urination, and the minor ablution after ejaculation. Urine is impure and semen is pure. With impure urine, the lesser purity is mandatory, but with pure semen the greater purity. This is so that you will know that the religion is founded on the transmitted, not on the rationally derived; on the Book, not onreasoning; on making oneself a servant, not on self-exertion.The origin of the major ablution is from the era of Adam. When Adam came from paradise to this world, he fell into companionship with Eve. Gabriel came and said, �O Adam, make a full ablution, for God commands you to do so."

Whenever someone says this, he is not a worshiper of God, for he has called upon an idol. In reality, he has been held back from the religion of guidance. The right belief and pure religion is that you consider the God of the world's folk and Creator of all to be pure of and incomparable with spouse, child, and partner. He did not give birth, nor did anyone give birth to Him. He is free of new arrival, change, and birth, hallowed beyond defect, incapacity, and need, pure in attribute, fitting in artisanry, sweet in speech, and complete in love. He is pure of fault in attributes, pure of blunder in deeds, pure of negligence in speech, and pure of doubt in love. He is a God who is outside of imaginations, and no one knows how He is. He is worthy of Godhood, knower of God-work, separate from faults, without peer in Essence and attributes. Whoever believes this has been released from the greater associationism and has joined with the root of faith.As for the lesser associationism, it is of two sorts and belongs to two groups. For the faithful it is eye-service and letting go of self-purification in deeds. For the recognizers, it is paying regard to deeds and seeking deliverance thereby. Its trace in the faithful is to decrease their faith, to bring fissures into their certainty, and to close down the door of clarity. MuṣṬafā said, �I am very fright-ened of the ancient associationism for my community.� He was asked what ancient associationism was, and he said, �That someone does good deeds along with eye-service in the deeds.�Shaddād ibn Aws said, �I saw God's Messenger weeping."

In another place He says, �obeyed, and also trustworthy� [81:21]. He reported from the daughter of Shuʿayb that she said to her father about Moses, God's speaking companion, �O my father, hire him! Surely the best you can hire is the strong, the trustworthy� [28:26]. And in describing Joseph the sincerely truthful He says, quoting the king of Egypt, �Surely today with us thou art emplaced, trustworthy� [12:54].The trusts about which the Book and the Sunnah talk are three things: One is obedience and the religion, for the Lord of the Worlds calls them a trust.

MuṣṬafā said, �Deliver the trust back to the one who entrusted you.� He also said, �If a man relates some words, pay regard, for it is his trust.�Mustāfā also said, �Sitting together is a trust.� In other words, when you sit with people, it must be on condition of holding in trust."

What beautiful compan- ions they!Ibn ʿAbbās says that this verse came down concerning Thawbān, who had become wasted and weak in love for God's Messenger, his back bent and his face yellow. One day the Messenger said to him, �O Thawbān, what is it with you? Has your face turned yellow because you stay awake at night?�He said, �O Messenger of God, this and that, as you know.�He said, �O Thawbān, are you placing a great deal of suffering on yourself through various sorts of discipline? You have become so weak and your back is bent over!�Thawbān said, �Yes, O Messenger of God, it has been something of all that.�The Messenger said, �O Thawbān, is it that you are desiring?� Thawbān's eyes filled with tears when he heard talk of desire.How long will you ask me, �Why are you suffering?� In truth, you know my state better than I.�O Messenger of God, I do not know how the nights pass until day comes and I see you again.� Wishing for you by day is the veil of my idleness,aching for you by night is the chamber of my wakefulness.Separation from you is the adornment of my sorrow, fervor for you is the capital of my awareness.�O Messenger of God! The hardest sorrow is that in the next world you will be in the highest of the High Chambers, and I will be held back from seeing you.�While they were in the midst of this came Gabriel, the messenger of the Presence, the courier of mercy, bringing a verse: �Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger-they will be with those whom God has blessed,� and so on to the end. God's Messenger recited it to him and made his heart happy, placing a balm on his woundedness. Yes, it wants a pain like this for there to appear a balm like that! Until you burn, you will not find a way out. Until you drown in Remember Me! in the ocean of remembrance, you will not reach the shore of security by the hand of I will remember you [2:152].A man with nothing will never find an accomplished friend- pain for Ishmael calls for the burn of Abraham."

Anyone not nurtured by these sorts of courtesy has nothing to do with the path of MuṣṬafā and has no worth in the world of No god but God. The exalted Lord first adorned MuṣṬafā with courtesy, as his come in the report: �My Lord taught me courtesy, so how beautifully I have been made courteous!� Thus on the night of the miʿrāj in that most tremendous station, he acted courteously toward the Presence, such that the exalted Lord says about him, �The eyesight did not swerve, nor did it trespass� [53:17]. He observed the courtesy of companionship with people, such that He says about him, �Surely thou hast a tremendous character� [68:4].The principles of the courteous acts of companionship in interacting with the Real are that you put knowledge to work in every interaction, you revere the Shariah, you avoid putting into practice what your wishes command, you honor the Sunnah and its folk, you avoid innovation and its folk, you leave aside suspicion and supposition, you stay far from disquieting thoughts and the habits of eye-service, ignorance, and laziness in worshiping God, you avoid adorning yourself as a worship- ful servant in other than the Sunnah, you keep supererogatory acts hidden, you not mention the name God in heedlessness, you not mix levity with seriousness, you not play with the Shariah and the religion, and you put scrupulosity to work in speaking, acting, seeing, eating, sleeping, moving, and resting. Even if you pass your days with truthfulness and limpidness, you never approve of yourself. Rather, you must always be displeased with yourself, and you must make it incumbent upon yourself to repent in every state. The Messenger said, �My heart becomes clouded, so I ask forgiveness from God one hundred times a day.�Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī was so displeased with his own limpidness and self-purification that his glorification sometimes consisted of pointing at himself with his finger and saying, �You are the miserable man of the time."

      "text": "O you who have faith! When you strike forth on the path of God, look clearly, and say not to him who offers you peace, �You are not of the faithful,� seeking the chance goods of this world's life.By way of allusion, He is saying that when you go on a journey, go for the sake of reaching one of the friends of God so that he may be the intimate of your days and the witness of your heart and spirit. No matter how far you go, never be at ease from seeking and do not hold back the foot of effort. The friends are the favorites of the Exalted Threshold and accepted by the Presence of Divinity. Not everyone sees them, not every eyesight perceives them. When you find them, give ear, and when you see them, cling to them, for the brightness of the heart lies in witnessing them and endless felicity in being their companion.The pir of the Tariqah Junayd was asked, �Which do you prefer? Two cycles of voluntary prayer or an hour of witnessing the poor.�He said, �An hour of witnessing the poor, for witnessing the poor is God's love, for He says, 'It is incumbent on Me to love those who love each other in Me and who visit each other in Me.' Bringing God's love to hand is an obligatory act for everyone. Leaving aside this obligatory act and choosing a supererogatory act is not the work of the clever and the conduct of the chevaliers.�"
