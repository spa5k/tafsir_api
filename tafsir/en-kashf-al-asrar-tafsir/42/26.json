  "text": "And He responds to those who have faith and do wholesome deeds, and He increases them in His bounty.This \ufffdincrease,\ufffd according to the commentators among the Folk of the Sunnah, is the vision of the Lord. In the same way, He says in another place, \ufffdThose who do what is beautiful shall have the most beautiful and an increase\ufffd [10:26]. When the servant reaches the vision of God, he reaches it through God's bounty, not his own obedience, as He says: \ufffdand He increases them in His bounty.\ufffd Tomorrow, when He bestows His vision on His friends, He will do so by the request of His own beauty, not the request of mortal man. How could an insignificant mortal have the gall to make the request himself? What a marvelous business! Before the vision of others the exaltedness of jealousy requires mask upon mask, but the perfection of beauty requires self-disclosure upon self- disclosure!Though He's always hidden behind the curtainthe light of His face is apparent on every horizon.Once when he was overpowered by ecstasy, Ab큰 Bakr Shibl카 said, \ufffdO God, tomorrow raise up everyone blind so that only Shibl카 may see You!\ufffdAnother time he said, \ufffdO God, raise up Shibl카 blind, for it would be a shame for someone like me to see You!\ufffdThe first words were jealousy for beauty against the eyes of others, and the second time was jealousy for that beauty against his own eyes. In the road of the chevaliers, the second step is more complete and more exalted than the first.Jealous for You, I'll pull out my heart and eyesso my eyes will not see You and my heart will know nothing more of You.Evidence that tomorrow's vision of the Lord will be at the request of beauty is in the sound report, \ufffdWhen the folk of the Garden enter the Garden, a call will come to them, 'O folk of the Garden, you have an appointment with God that He desires to fulfill.'\ufffd When the folk of paradise come into paradise and they take up residence in their own goodly dwellings, a call will come, \ufffdO friends of the Real! You have a promise with the Real. Come and be present, for the Real will realize that promise through His bounty."
