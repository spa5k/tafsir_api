      "text": "As for the unbelievers, their possessions will not take away their need for God, neither their children, and it is they who will be fuel for the Fire.What a majestic God, generous, lovingly kind, who promises the faithful in the midst of warning the unbelievers and who caresses these while blaming those! He is saying, �Tomorrow at the res- urrection possessions and children will be useless to the unbelievers and will not profit them.� In other words, they will be useful to the faithful whenever they have carried out what is rightfully due to them, making them the snare of their own religion and seeking through them their endless felicity.MuṣṬafā said, �How excellent are wholesome possessions for the wholesome man! What ex- cellent assistance are possessions for being wary of God!� This is just what the Lord of the Worlds says: �And, with what God has given thee, follow after the Last Abode� [28:77]. He is saying, �In that of this world which He has given you, bring the next world to hand! Seek the felicity of the next world!� The felicity of the next world lies in recognition of God. Recognition comes from the light of the heart. The light of the heart comes from the lamp of tawḤīd, and the root of this lamp is the divine bestowal. As for its material, that comes from the deeds and obedient acts of the body. Obedient acts come from the strength of the soul, and the soul's strength comes from food, drink, and clothing. Food, drink, and clothing are nothing but possessions. Hence possessions, by this series of steps, are the cause of endless felicity. But, one must not pass beyond the measure of sufficiency, for then these will become the cause of rebellion, just as He says: �No indeed; surely man is rebellious because he sees himself without needs� [96:6-7]. This is why God's Messenger supplicated, �Lord God, make the food of Muhammad's family in the measure of sufficiency!� When the measure of sufficiency is for the leisure to worship, then it itself is nothing but worship, for it is the supplies for the road, and the road supplies are also part of the road.Shaykh Abu'l-Qāsim Kurragānī had a lawful landed estate from which he received his suffi- ciency."

When He says, �O youwho have faith,� He says, �Be wary of God� along with it.Be wary of your Lord is addressed to the common people. Their godwariness is based on seeing blessings, and their aspiration is nurturing the body to serve the Real. Be wary of God is addressed to the folk of caresses and generosity. Their godwariness is based on being watchful of the Beneficent and their aim is the repose of the spirit in witnessing the Real. What a difference between the two!Be wary of your Lord is addressed to the wage-earners, and Be wary of God is addressed to the recognizers. The wage-earners are seeking joy and blessings, and the recognizers are seeking the mystery of the Beneficent. From God the wage-earners want other than Him, but the recognizers want God Himself.AḤmad ibn Khiẓrūya saw the Real in a dream. He said, �O AḤmad! Everyone is seeking something from Me, except Abū Yazīd. He is seeking Me.�People are wishing for repose and comfort,but I, O Exalted One, wish to encounter You empty.*On the day I reach union with YouI will disdain the state of the paradise-dwellers.It has been said that godwariness is of three sorts: One is wariness of God's punishment by having patience against acts of disobedience, as He says: �Be wary of the Fire that has been prepared for the unbelievers� [3:131]. Second is the godwariness of gratitude for blessings, as He says: �Be wary of your Lord� [4:1]. Third is godwariness at the vision of Unity, without taking into account reward or punishment, as He says: �Be wary of God as is the rightful due of His wariness.� The first is the godwariness of the wrongdoers, the second the godwariness of the moderate, and the third the godwariness of the preceders."

They are not taken aback by the blame of any blamer nor cut off from God by relying on any causes. They have seen the shortcomings of their own souls and immersed their lives in gaining God's approval. They act for God, give counsel for God's religion, and call God's creatures to God. Their trade has profited them and they do not regret their handshake.This is the description of a people who stand through the Real's making them stand and who have been freed from their own power and strength and disengaged from their own desires and aims. They are outside the circle of deeds and states, free of the captivity of choice and self- determination. They know God, they call upon God, and they strive in God's religion. They do not think about people or their blame. In their hearts they have friendship for the Patron and in their eyes the collyrium of Self-disclosure. They see everything just as it is. Others look from the artisanry to the Artisan, but they look from the Artisan to the artisanry. They are the elect of the Presence, branded by the Empire.Be the elect servant of the king-with his brandyou're safe from police by day and patrols by night.They are the ones burnt by union and killed by love. Their blood has been spilled and their prop- erty destroyed, but their hearts are in His grasp, their spirits in His embrace. This is why they say,You have a Heart-taker better than life.Don't grieve-let go of life.�When someone is destroyed in God, God takes his place.�"

      "text": "And do not be like those who became dispersed and disagreed.Dispersion is one thing and disagreement something else. Dispersion is the opposite of together- ness and disagreement the opposite of agreement. Dispersion is the scatteredness of the folk of the Tariqah and disagreement the scatteredness of the folk of the Shariah.Dispersion is that the servant desires one thing and the Real desires something else. Togeth- erness is that the servant's desire and the Real's desire are one. According to the report, �When someone makes his concerns one concern, God will spare him the concerns of this world and the next world.�It has been said that dispersion is to gaze on the creatures and to see the secondary causes such that you are never relieved of suffering and creaturely antagonism. Togetherness is to gaze on the Real and to know that the Real is one, the work comes from one place, and the decree comes from this one door.As for the disagreement of the lords of the Shariah, that is of two sorts: One is in the principles of the religion, the other in the branches. Disagreement in the principles is terrible and dangerous, since one must be right and the other wrong. When someone's goal lies in the west and he takes the road east, how can he ever reach the goal? The more he goes, the more he moves away from the goal day by day, and he falls farther behind. This is alluded to in His words, �Surely this path of Mine is straight, so follow it. And do not follow the paths, lest they disperse you from His path� [6:153].As for the disagreement of the community on the branches, it is like a group who set out for one goal by disagreeing roads, some going nearer and some farther. Although they disagree in the traveling, they arrive at one goal and come together. This disagreement is mercy itself. To it the Prophet alluded: �Disagreement in my community is a mercy.� In other words, this disagreement in branches is God's mercy toward the creatures, so that the work of the religion would not become narrow for them and its road would not be difficult. This is in His words, �He placed no hardship upon you in the religion� [22:78]; and in God's words, �God desires for you ease and does not desire for you hardship� [2:185]."

They wanted good for them and attached their hearts to their submission. They wanted their salvation and did not hold back God's mercy from them-whether they were acquaintances or strangers. This kept on crossing their minds:Bring the sweetmeat, for it is the heart's beloved, suited for both the elect and the common.This is the same tenderness that MuḤammad showed to the estranged. He said, �O God, guide my people, for they do not know.�As for the unbelievers, those who had no limpidness in their hearts or loyalty in their natures, they never wanted good for the people of faith, nor did they love them. They grieved at the good that reached them and became happy at the bad. God says, �If something beautiful touches you, it vexes them, and if something ugly strikes you, they rejoice at it� [3:120].Indeed, everyone does what is fitting for him, for �The pot pours what is inside it.� The person of faith is generous and lovingly kind, for what is fitting for faith is generosity and chivalry. The unbeliever is base and bad-wanting, for what is fitting for unbelief is baseness and unseemliness. The person of faith calls God's creatures to salvation and deliverance. The unbeliever calls them to the Fire and captivity. To this He alludes with His words, �O my people! What is it with me that I invite you to salvation and you invite me to the Fire?� [40:41]."

But, in respect of the view of the elect and the reality of the work, how can it be said that someone is lowly and abased when God is his helper?The Pir of the Tariqah said in his whispered prayers, �O Lord, in recognizing You we are alive, with Your help we are happy, with Your generosity we are joyful, through Your exalting we are exalted. O Lord, in You we are alive, so how can we ever die? In You we are happy, so how can we ever be sorrowful? In You we are joyful, so how can we live without You? In You we are exalted, so how can we ever be abased?�A man entered in on Hārūn al-Rashīd and commanded him to do the honorable. Hārūn be- came angry and put him inside a room with a lion, with the door firmly shut. The lion entered in upon the man with humility and did not harm him. After that, they saw him in the midst of the gar- den, happily gazing at it, and the door to the room was firmly locked as it had been. They reported his state to Hārūn, and he summoned him. He said, �Who let you out of the room?�He answered, �The one who brought me into the garden.� He said, �Who brought you into the garden?�He said, �The one who brought me out of the room.�Hārūn commanded that they should put him on a seat with exaltation and honor and carry him around the city, with a caller going before him saying, �Behold, Hārūn al-Rashīd wanted to abase a servant exalted by God, and he was unable to do so.�"

      "text": "Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, those who curb rage, and those who pardon people-and God loves the beautiful-doers.Those who spend in prosperity and adversity. It has been said that in this station people are three groups: First are those who spend nothing, whether in prosperity or adversity, whether in the vast- ness of blessings or in the days of famine and hardship. They are called �base� in an unqualified sense. They have seized the branch of niggardliness, which is a tree whose roots are in hell and whose branches are in this world. This is according to what Anas ibn Mālik reported from God's Messenger: �Openhandedness is a tree in the Garden whose branches are in this world; when someone latches on to one of its branches, it will lead him to the Garden. And niggardliness is a tree in the Fire whose branches are in this world; when someone latches on to one of its branches, it will lead him to the Fire.�Second are those who spend in vastness of blessings but not in narrowness and hardship. Most of God's creatures among the world's folk and those who take care of this world are in this station. In the work of this world they do not have the confidence for open-handedness and they are always in fear of poverty. To them alludes His words, �If He asks you for them, then presses you, you are niggardly, and He brings out your rancor� [47:37].Third are those who spend in both of these states, both in ease and difficulty. Such a person has one of two states: Either he is an impudent and impure man who does not know whence he takes and where he gives and does not think about the outcome. He is numbered among the broth- ers of Satan. That is in His words, �Surely the squanderers are the brothers of Satan� [17:27]. Or he is a man who is confident in the sufficiency of God and His assignment of daily provision. He has recognized the secret of this report from MuṣṬafā: �Surely the holy spirit breathed into my mind that no one will die until his provision is complete. So be wary of God, and go lightly in your seeking. Never let the tardiness of provision make you seek something of God's bounty through disobedience, for what is with God will only be reached by obeying Him."

That is the enjoyment of the life of this world.The paragon of the world and master of the children of Adam, MuṣṬafā, reported that when the Eternal Enactor created paradise, He said to Gabriel, �'O Gabriel! Go look at it.' Go gaze on this paradise and see once what I have made and created for My servants and friends.� Gabriel went and saw those adorned paradises with their infinite joy and bliss, that place of revelry made and prepared in the neighborhood of God's Presence for the exalted ones of the road and God's friends.When Gabriel came back he said, �Lord God, 'By Thy exaltedness, no one will hear of it and not enter into it!' By the exaltedness of Your Lordhood, no one will hear the attributes of this para- dise without aiming for it and becoming obedient so that he may enter it.�Then the Lord of the Worlds surrounded paradise with all the hardship and suffering of unwor- thy things and unreached desires, and He made its road a bridge of trial so that everyone who aims for the Patron must first pass over that bridge of trial.Shaykh al-Islām Anṣārī said, �How should I have known that suffering is the mother of hap- piness and that beneath one disappointment lie a thousand treasures? How should I have known which gate this is or what is the answer to the story of friendship? How should I have known that companionship with You is the greatest Resurrection and that the exaltation of union with You lies in the abasement of bewilderment?�O spirit of the world! The Kaabah is a sweet place, the nest of God's friends and the lodging place of the sincerely truthful, but there is a man-eating desert before it, mile after mile and way station after way station. Who in the end will have the seeking to pass over all those miles and way stations until he reaches the magnificent Kaabah?A world is wandering in the desert of Your love-who will be given access to the Kaabah of Your acceptance? [DS 210]After He made the road of paradise that of unreached desires and disappointment, the command came, �O Gabriel: Look again."

If anyone turns back on his heels, he will not harm God in anything, and God will recompense the grateful.As much as MuḤammad is praised and chosen among all men and caressed by the God of the world's folk, as much as he is the pole of the world and the lamp of heaven and earth, the chieftain and full moon of the universe, emulated by the creatures, the paragon of the engendered beings, and the Seal of the Prophets-despite all this, he is a mortal man. Death is fitting for him and an- nihilation applies to him. As many prophets as there have been in the world, all of them went. The Real did not disappear, nor was God harmed. The Real remained after all of them, and God is their keeper in the perfection of His exaltedness.By way of allusion, the folk of realization are being addressed: �The perfection of Our ex- altedness is free of need for that which was not, then came to be. There is no link between Our lordhood and that which was not, then came to be. Our unity does not call for an existence-giver, and Our Being does not need a strengthener. Our exaltedness recognizes Our magnificence, and Our Unity knows Our exaltedness.Her own face had itself as a moon,her own eye had itself as collyrium.A sound report has come that He says, �O My servants! If the first of you and the last of you, the men of you and jinn of you, the living of you and the dead of you, had the heart of the most godwary man among you, that would add nothing to My kingdom. O My servants! If the first of you and the last of you, the men of you and jinn of you, the living of you and the dead of you, had the heart of the most depraved man among you, that would take nothing away from My kingdom.� What, if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? This verse provides evidence for the eminence of Abū Bakr, for when MuṣṬafā was taken away from this house of decrees and the steed of death was sent for his prophethood's shining face, then in the attribute of exaltedness the Divine Pres- ence snatched that shining face away from the steed of death and took him into the embrace of Unity."

This is because the reward of the after- world is lasting, but the reward of this world is passing. The former comes into being constantly without blight and without trouble, but the latter is soon cut off and has blights and tribulations.God loves the beautiful-doers. The beautiful-doers are the �grateful� who are mentioned in verse 3:144. The �recompense� to which He alludes there is the love that He explains here. Beautiful doing is what MuṣṬafā said in answering Gabriel: �It is that you worship God as if you see Him.� Beautiful doing is the attribute of the self-watchful, the state of the finders, the station of the approving, and the mark of the friends. Love for God is their watchword and remembering God their blanket. God's love is pouring down on them, and this pouring is like a sweetheart inside their spirit. From it the tree of happiness gives fruit and the spirit has a happy springtime.Hail, O sweet breeze of early spring!You give off the scent of that idol's tresses."

For those who are godwary there shall be with their Lord gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever, and spouses made pure, and approval from God.After talking about the enemies, describing their life, and explaining their furthest goal, God in this verse comes back to the story of the friends. Tomorrow, the final outcome of those whose watch- word today is godwariness will be paradise and approval. He says, �For those who are godwary there shall be with their Lord gardens.�Just as godwariness has levels, so also paradise has degrees. The first degree is the Garden of the Shelter, and the first level of godwariness is to avoid the forbidden and the soul's caprice. The Splendorous Qur'an ties the two together in its words, �As for him who fears the standing place be- fore his Lord and prohibits the soul its caprice, surely the Garden shall be the shelter� [79:40-41]. The highest degree is the Garden of Eden, and better than the Garden of Eden is the Greatest Approval. So, the furthest goal of the paradise-dwellers is the Greatest Approval, just as the Lord of the Worlds says: �And goodly dwellings in the gardens of Eden; and approval from God isgreatest� [9:72]The Greatest Approval belongs to those who reach the utmost godwariness. The utmost god- wariness is that someone takes whatever has the scar of new arrival and the mark of creation as his own enemy, as Abraham said: �Surely they are an enemy to me, save the Lord of the Worlds� [26:77]. You must turn away from all things and, with detached heart, busy yourself with the suf- fering of passion for the Haqiqah. You must know for certain that the intrusion of others finds no room in passion's suffering. You must cut off your heart and spirit from everything.The heart is Your garden-take it all, for this heart has room either for my intrusion or Your image.In gratitude I will also send my spirit to You-a whiff of union with You does what a hundred spirits cannot.Tomorrow, all will be taken to the furthest limit of their goals and aspirations. Here someone hopes for the Garden of the Refuge and is told, �Flee from the unlawful and be just, and that will not be held back from you."

O paragon of engendered beings! You are generous and lovingly kind, gentle and ever-merciful to everyone. You drive everyone by customs that hit the mark. You call everyone to the table of exaltedness and convey to everlasting felicity. You are like a father for the orphans, a husband for the widowed.

Struggle against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be hard with them [9:73].�There is a great difference between the Beloved [MuḤammad] and the Speaking Companion [Moses]. He commanded the Beloved to be harsh with the unbelievers and he called him back from cajolery, for in his disposition all was softness and benevolence. To the Speaking Companion He said the opposite: �Speak to him with soft words� [20:44]. He commanded him to softness and benevolence, and He called him back from the sharpness and hardness that was within him.Then He says, �Hadst thou been harsh and hard of heart, they would have scattered from around thee. O master, if you were to give the unmixed wine of tawḤīd to your companions, with- out the admixture of their own shares, they would flee and no longer come around you.

The submission has three way stations.The first way station is the acknowledgment that spares blood and wealth: the person's neck is safe from the sword and his wealth is left with him, whether he is a conformer or a hypocrite, a follower or an innovator.The next way station is the acknowledgment that is right belief, following the Sunnah, and the loyalty of deeds.The third way station of submission is surrender, which is the utmost end of the work. It is pleasing to God and is the refuge of recognition. It is to throw oneself on the Real's exalted thresh- old and follow Him, approving of His decree, not protesting against it or turning away from it, and having reverence and respect for it. What Abraham asked for himself and Ishmael in his supplica- tion-that they be submitters-is the utmost end of this third way station: �Our Lord, make us submitters to Thee!� [2:128]. This is the same as when it was said to him, �Submit!,� he said, �I submit to the Lord of the worlds� [2:131]. It is also alluded to in His words telling about Joseph: �Receive me as a submitter and join me with the wholesome� [12:101]."

This is the remembrance of the wrongdoer, who is aware neither of the remembrance nor of the Remembered.Another remembers Him with the tongue and is present with the heart. This is the remem- brance of the moderate and the state of the wage-earner. He is seeking reward and excused in his seeking.The third remembers Him with the heart; the heart is filled with Him, and his tongue is silent in remembrance. �When someone recognizes God, his tongue is mute.� This is the remembrance of the preceder. His tongue is lost in the remembrance, and the remembrance is lost in the Remem- bered. The heart is lost in love, and love in the Light. The spirit is lost in face-to-face vision, and face-to-face vision is far from explication.Remembrance set a trap whose bait was jealousy. The wage-earner saw the trap and fled, the recognizer saw the bait and clung to the trap.The Pir of the Tariqah said, �Remembrance is not simply what you have on the tongue. True remembrance is what you have in the midst of the spirit. TawḤīd is not simply that you know that He is one. True tawḤīd is that you be one for Him and a stranger to other than Him.�And reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth. Abū ʿAlī Daqqāq asked Abū ʿAbd al-RaḤmān Sulamī whether remembrance was more complete or reflection. Abū ʿAbd al-RaḤmān answered, �Remembrance is more complete than reflection because remembrance is an attribute of the Real and reflection an attribute of creation. That by which the Real is described is more complete than that which is specific to creation.�Reflecting for the heart is like sniffing for the breath. Reflecting on one's own deeds and words is mandatory, on the artifacts of the Artisan recommended, and on the Artisan's Essence for- bidden. In the report has come, �Do not reflect upon God, for surely you are not able to judge His measure.� He is saying: �Do not reflect on God's Essence, for you will not reach His measure, nor will you recognize Him as is proper to Him, nor will you perceive the foundations of His majesty and tremendousness."

The verification of this loyalty is that He responded to the caller, He bestowed upon the asker, He assisted the striver, He gave increase to the grateful, He bestowed insight on the patient, He rewarded the obedient, He absolved the disobedient, He had mercy on the regretful, He honored the lover, He gave vision to the yearner.The command came, �O MuḤammad!

Patience through God is the patience of the recognizers in the station of honoring with the hope of union. Patience with God is the patience of the lovers in the state of contemplation at the moment of self-disclosure, when they are looking with gazing eyes, their hearts bewildered in what is seen, their spirits lamenting at the hand of love.The Pir of the Tariqah said, �O God, everyone is burning in separation, but the lover in vi- sion.

The fruit it brings forth is the fruit of triumph, endless prosperity, everlasting worthiness, subsistent bliss, and the kingdom of forever. This is why the Lord of the Worlds says, �Perhaps you will prosper.� The Prophet said, �You should be wary of God, for this brings together every good; you should have struggle, for it is the submitter's monasticism; and you should have the remembrance of God, for it is your light.�"

The reality of friendship is conformity, that is, being a friend of His friend and an enemy of His enemy. The master of the Shariah alluded to this with his words, �The most reliable handhold of faith is love in God and hate in God.�The traditions say that the Lord of the Worlds sent a revelation to one of the former prophets: �Say to the servants, 'In this world you have taken up renunciation in order to hurry to your own comfort and be relieved of this world's suffering. With your obedience and worship you have sought your own exaltation and your own good name. Now look: What have you done for Me? Have you ever loved My friends? Have you ever taken My enemies as your enemies?�This is exactly what He said to Jesus: �O Jesus, if the worship of all the inhabitants of heaven and earth accompanies you in the path of the religion, but you have no love for My friends and no enmity for My enemies, then your worship has been useless and without profit.�It is reported that Abū Idrīs Khawlānī said to Muʿādh, �I love you in the path of God.� Muʿādh said, �Let it be good news!

Because it was in God's knowledge that the Christians would exaggerate concerning him, the Lord of the Worlds gave him speech in the cradle in the state of infancy to reject those Christians, so he said, �Surely I am the servant of God� [19:30]. In other words, it is not as the Christians say. Rather, �I am the servant of God, created by Him, and He is my Lord.� It is also a rejection of those who criticized his mother: �O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of ugliness� [19:28]. The Lord of the Worlds declared her in- nocence and, to brighten her eyes, He made those words come to his tongue in the state of infancy. Here there is an exalted point: Since it was in God's knowledge that Jesus would be the brightness of Mary's eyes and the joy of her heart in this world and the afterworld, the Lord of the Worlds placed the burden and pain of Jesus on her at the time of birth. That is in His words, �And the birth pangs took her to the trunk of a date palm� [19:23]. Thus what was rightfully due became incumbent for her. As the counterpart of that suffering and hardship, blessings and ease reached her. MuṣṬafā's state with his mother was the opposite of this. Since it was in God's knowledge that his mother would have no portion of him, whether in this world or in the next, He did not place the burden of MuṣṬafā upon her, and at the time of birth no suffering reached her, so that no rightfuldue would become incumbent for her.Similar to this is the story of Noah and his community and that of MuṣṬafā and his community. It was said to Noah, �Do not let yourself suffer for the community and do not carry the load of their trial, for they will never give you brightness of the eyes and joy of the heart: None of your community will have faith except those who already have faith� [11:36].

What do I have and what can I do? Who has ability like Your ability? In praising You who has a tongue? Without Your love, who has the joy of spirit?�Without the breeze of the heart-taker's love, the garden has no ease, without the radiance of that rose-colored face, there's no light or fire."

Come to a word common between us and you: that we worship none but God, that we associate nothing with Him, and that some of us not take others of us as lords apart from God.�In terms of realization, this is addressed to the folk of tawḤīd and the desirers on the road of the Haqiqah. He is saying, �If you who are traveling on the path of truthfulness today want to be dwellers in the seat of truthfulness [54:55] tomorrow, be careful to protect your walkway from the debris of customs, to sweep away the opacities of mortal nature from the carpet of your present moment, and to make the drinking place of your aspiration pure of the dust of others. Be one in heart, one in desire, and one in aspiration. 'When someone comes to have one concern, God will suffice him against the concerns of this world and the next.'� This is why He says, �and that some of us do not take others of us as lords apart from God�: Do not settle down in every street with each scatteredness of the heart. Do not obey the commanding soul, do not worship blameworthy caprice, and take not two gods; surely He is but One God [16:51].As long as the talk of some defiled fellow grabs you,you're the servant of your own fancy, not a servant of God."

Rather, it is an allusion to being. It means that our Lord is, He is fitting to be, and He has been-beyond location and transcendent in attributes. ShurayḤ ʿābid said, �I saw a dervish in the mosque of the Sanctuary calling upon God by saying, 'O He who is He! O He other than whom there is no he! Forgive me.' A voice came from the Unseen: 'O dervish, you received so much reward for saying that the first time that the angels will be writ- ing it out until the resurrection.'�Huwa is two letters, h and w. The place of articulation of h is the last part of the throat, and the place of articulation of the w is the first part of the throat. This alludes to the fact that the letters begin from Him at first and return to Him at last. From Him they begin and to Him they return. It has also been said it alludes to the created things and engendered beings: all things come in the beginning from His power and return in the end by His decree.A dervish in the state of rapture was asked, �What is your name?� He answered, �He.� They said, �Where have you come from?� He said, �He.� They said, �What do you want?� He said, �He.� They said, �Perhaps you mean 'God'.� When the dervish heard the name God, he gave his spirit to the name and left this world.The painters depict Your name in a hundred meanings; remembering You and Your name they give up their spirits.They scatter their lives for the scent of union with Youwith nothing in hand of Your description but incapacity.Wherein are firm verses, which are the mother of the Book, and others ambiguous. These are the two great divisions of the Qur'an, one apparent and clear, the other abstruse and difficult. The ap- parent belongs to the majesty of the Shariah, and the difficult belongs to the beauty of the Haqiqah. The apparent is so the common people may reach joy and blessings by perceiving it and putting it into practice."

Say: �Surely the guidance is God's guidance,� lest anyone should be given the like of what you have been given, or dispute with you before your Lord. Say: �Surely the bounty is in God's hand. He gives it to whomso- ever He wills.� And God is all-embracing, knowing.Some of the commentators have said that here God is addressing the Muslims and caressing the folk of recognition and faith. He is reminding them of His favor toward them with the religion of the submission. The address then has two paths. In one respect it is addressed to the common faithful of this community, and in the other respect it is addressed to the recognizers and the elect among the folk of the Tariqah.The first respect is this: �O assembly of submitters! Do not suppose or hold firm that anyone has been given what has been given to you. There is no religion like the religion of the submission, and it was given to you. There is no book like the Qur'an, and it was given to you. There is no prophet like MuḤammad, and he was given to you. There is no month like Ramadan, and it belongs to you. There is no day like Friday, and it belongs to you. All the shariahs have been abrogated by your shariah, and all the compacts have been abrogated by your compact. The perfection of the religion and the Shariah and the beauty of the Tariqah and the Haqiqah are all in your covenant.� This is in His words, �Today I have perfected your religion for you and I have completed My bless- ings upon you and I have approved the submission for you as a religion� [5:3].�Now give gratitude for this blessing, give thanks to your Object of worship, and obey the command. The command is this: 'Do not have faith in any but those who follow your religion.' Do not exercise friendship with any but those who share your religion, and do not show brother- hood to any but the faithful. Keep away from the irreligious and the estranged.� This is just what He says in this verse: �Do not lean upon those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you� [11:113]."

He singles out a group for provisions, He singles out a group for the blessing of character traits, He singles out a group for the blessing of worship, others for the blessing of desire, others for the success of outwardness, others for the realiza- tion of the secret cores, others for the gift of outer skins, others for the encounter with the secrets. God says, and His words are truth: �If you count God's blessings, you will not enumerate them� [14:34].7 He singles out for His mercy whomsoever He will. He brought them together obscurely anddid not specify anyone so that the hopeful would increase in their hope and the fearful would not remain in their fear. In the station of worship and obedience the servants will not find any statesbetter than hope and fear, for the Lord of the Worlds praises the servants in these two states and says, �They hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement� [17:57].He is also calling attention to the fact that even if the servants strive to the utmost in obedience and perform all the conditions of servanthood, in the end it is God's mercy that will deliver them. Concerning this the following has been narrated from the Prophet: �No one will enter the Garden by his deeds.�It was said to him, �Not even you, O Messenger of God!�He said, �Not even I, unless God envelops me with His mercy.�"

God knows better where to place His message [6:124]. How can he upon whom He has placed the brand of deprivation and the inscription of unawareness be sinless and truthful on the road today? And how can he to whom He has given good fortune gratis and whom He has placed on the road of truthfulness and sinlessness be roadless and bad in state today? So, what will take form and how can it enter into imagination? It could never happen that the chosen MuṣṬafā and the caressed Jesus, after the honor of prophethood, the confirmation of sinlessness, and the strength of messengerhood, take a step out of line and say to the people, �Be servants of me instead of God!�By virtue of the beginningless choice and eternal solicitude, the Lord of the Worlds answered on their behalf as their deputy: �They do not say this. Rather they say, 'Be you lordly ones!'� In other words: Be among those singled out for God, those who are described by His words, �When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears and his eyesight with which he sees.�In keeping with the tasting of the folk of recognition, the lordly ones are those who become one for God with disengaged intention, sound trust, and intimacy's breeze. They step beyond the two worlds and seize hold of the gentleness of the Patron's love. They say the prayer of the dead for their own attributes.When someone steps into the field of passion for the beautiful,night and day will recite for him the prayer of the dead. [DS 210]They have souls undergoing annihilation and hearts full of thirst. They have burnt souls, secret cores lit by passion, and spirits hanging in hope."

But the work is in this: When will this limpidness, loyalty, and supplication come together and how will they join with each other?The meaning of this supplication is this: �O God, keep our hearts far from confusion and straying and make us firm on the carpet of service with the stipulation of the Sunnah.�And give us mercy from Thee: And give what you give, O Lord, as Your bounty and mercy, not as the recompense for our works or the compensation for our acts of obedience! Our acts of obedience are not worthy for the Presence of Your Majesty, so the only thing to do is to efface them and ignore them.One of the pirs of the Tariqah said, �The gall-bladders of the travelers and the obedient ser- vants burst in fear at the verse: 'We shall advance upon what deeds they have done and make them scattered dust' [25:23]. But, of all the Qur'an's verses, I find this the sweetest.�He was asked, �What does it mean?�He said, �We will finally be released from these displeasing deeds and unworthy acts of obedi- ence and attach our hearts totally to His bounty and mercy.�"

You shall surely have faith in him and you shall surely help him.�In the whole Qur'an, there is no verse more complete in explaining the excellence of MuṣṬafā, to whom this verse is devoted without the association of anyone else. The Lord of the Worlds made two covenants with His creatures and took two compacts from them. One was the compact He took from the creatures concerning His Godhood and Enactorship, as He said: �When your Lord took from the children of Adam, from their loins, their offspring and made them bear witness concern- ing themselves. 'Am I not your Lord?' They said, 'Yes indeed'� [7:172]. The other is the compact He took with the angels and the prophets concerning MuḤammad's prophethood and helping him, as He says, �And when God took the compact of the prophets.� This is an utmost bestowal of eminence and a perfect acknowledgment of excellence, for He made his name great with His own name and lifted up his measure with His measure.Several thousand years before the existence of MuḤammad, a command came, �O Gabriel! I will have a friend whose name is MuḤammad. He will be praised and caressed by Me, his name will be placed next to My name, his measure will be lifted up by My bounty, his being obeyed will be obedience to Me, his words will be My revelation, and following him will be friendship with Me. O Gabriel! You make a covenant with Me to have faith in him and help him.� This was when He said, �You shall surely have faith in him and you shall surely help him.�Gabriel said, �O Lord, I make a covenant that my hand will be one with his hand, I will help, and I will have faith in him.�God said, �O Gabriel! Keep to this covenant and do not oppose it.� He said, �O Lord, who would have the gall to oppose You?!�Then He said, �O Michael! You be a witness to Gabriel's covenant.� Then in the same way He made a covenant with Michael, and He told Gabriel to be witness to Michael's covenant."

Any deed that is not following the Sunnah is the seed of remorse. The submission is the tree, the Sunnah is its water source, faith its fruit, and the Real the one who planted and nurtured it. When the wellspring of the Sunnah takes replenishment, it takes it from divine solicitude. If-refuge in God!-He should take back the solicitude, the wellspring would go dry. The tree would become ineffectual and barren, it would not give the fruit of faith, and it would be on the verge of disappearance and destruction. This is like the group who became apostates and turned away from the submission.Again, if the lordly solicitude should go forth and replenish the wellspring of the Sunnah, then the branches of the tree will be made from the goodly word [14:24] and its fruit from pure belief. The heaven of guidance will make the branch into a ladder, and in the state of life and death its fruit will become constant and never be cut off. This is why the Lord of the Worlds says by way of similitude, �God has struck a similitude: A goodly word is like a goodly tree, its roots fixed, and its branches in heaven. It gives its fruit every season by the leave of its Lord� [14:24-25].It has also been said that if a similitude is struck for the submission, it is a lamp that has been lit by the Most Tremendous Light, its material and nurture made to appear from the light of the Sunnah. To this is the allusion in His words, �Is he whose breast God has expanded for the sub- mission, so he is upon a light from his Lord [...]?� [39:22]. He is saying, �Whenever the Exalted Lord lights the lamp of the submission in a breast, assistance from the light of the Sunnah makes it appear so that the breast may always be adorned and lit. Hence, whenever someone does not have a whiff of the Sunnah, he will have no portion of the submission.It is narrated from Shāfiʿī that he said, �I saw God in a dream and He said to me, 'Ask a wish from Me."
