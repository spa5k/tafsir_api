  "text": "By the Inhabited House. The Inhabited House is an allusion to the hearts of the recognizers, inhabited with recognition and love. This is an allusion to the hearts of recognizers that are inhabited with recognition and love of God, hearts that live through His gaze and are happy with His gentleness. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “There are three things within which lie the servant's felicity and through which servanthood's face is bright: the tongue's occupation with remembering the Real, the heart's immersion in loving the Real, and the secret core's filling with the gaze of the Real. First comes the gaze from the Real, thus adorning the heart with love and keeping the tongue in remembrance.” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “O God, Your remembrance is my religion, Your love is my way, and Your gaze is the eye of certainty. This is my last word. O Gentle One, You know that this is so.” A great man said, “A tongue that is busy with His remembrance, a heart that is inhabited by His love, a spirit that is joyful with His gaze-in reality, this is the Inhabited House.” This state has three marks in which is the perfection of servanthood: plentiful deeds, being concealed from the people, and a heart always hurrying to the time of devotion."
