First comes the gaze from the Real, thus adorning the heart with love and keeping the tongue in remembrance.\ufffdThe Pir of the Tariqah said, \ufffdO God, Your remembrance is my religion, Your love is my way, and Your gaze is the eye of certainty. This is my last word. O Gentle One, You know that this is so.\ufffd A great man said, \ufffdA tongue that is busy with His remembrance, a heart that is inhabited byHis love, a spirit that is joyful with His gaze-in reality, this is the Inhabited House.\ufffdThis state has three marks in which is the perfection of servanthood: plentiful deeds, being concealed from the people, and a heart always hurrying to the time of devotion."
