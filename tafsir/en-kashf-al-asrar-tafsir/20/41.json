That was not for you, but rather for Me.\ufffd This is why, when he seized his brother by the head and pulled him severely, He did not say, \ufffdWhy did you do that?\ufffd When he punched out the eye of Azrael with his fist, He did not say, \ufffdWhy did you do that?\ufffd When he threw the tablets of the Torah on the ground, He did not say, \ufffdWhy did you throw them?\ufffd Yes, within the curtain of friendship things go on that outside the curtain of friendship would all be faults, but inside the curtain of friendship are tolerated.When the beloved comes with one sin,his beautiful traits come with a thousand interceders."
