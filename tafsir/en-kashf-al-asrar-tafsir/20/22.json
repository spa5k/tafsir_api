One was outside of himself, namely the staff, and the other was within himself, namely the white hand. The staff was a sample of the signs of the horizons, and the white hand was a sample of the signs of the souls. The Lord of the Worlds built the road of tawḤīd on the recognition of these two. He says, \ufffdWe shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in their souls until it is clear to them that He is the Real\ufffd [41:53]."
