Then his Lord chose him, so He turned toward him and guided.One of the pirs of the Tariqah was asked, \ufffdGiven all the good fortune, rank, standing, and proxim- ity that Adam the chosen had with the Real, what wisdom is there in the call that went out concern- ing him, 'And Adam disobeyed'?\ufffdThe Pir answered with the tongue of wisdom and the tasting of recognition: \ufffdThe seed of love had been thrown into the earth of Adam's heart. Then the canal of his eyes was opened for the water of remorse, and the sun of And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord [39:69] shone forth on that good clay, receptive to the seed of pain.

The angels of the Dominion will look with wonder and say, \ufffdThis is that solitary man who moved out of paradise a few days ago in poverty and indigence!\ufffd\ufffdO Adam, bringing you out of paradise was a curtain over this business and a covering over the mysteries, for your loins were the ocean of the one-hundred-twenty some thousand center points of prophethood's pearls."
