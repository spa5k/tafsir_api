  "text": "From it We created you and to it We shall return you.Know that the Adamite is two things: spirit and body. The spirit is from light, and light is celestial. The body is from dust, and dust is terrestrial. The spirit wants to go up because it is celestial. The body wants to go down because it is terrestrial. In the perfection of His power, the King bound the two together. The spirit was bound to the body, and the body was bound to the spirit, so both are in bonds. The spirit and the body settled down together.On the day of death, when the life of the servant comes to an end and the moment of death arrives, the bonds are loosened, as when a bird comes out of its cage. The spirit rises up from the body and goes skyward to its nest. The body takes the road of the earth to its center. The spirit is put into a lantern of light, which is hung from the tree of blessedness. The body is wrapped in a shroud and entrusted to the earth. This is why the Lord of the worlds says, \ufffdFrom it We created you and to it We shall return you.\ufffd After a few days pass, the spirit comes to gaze on the body. It sees the state of the body changed and it laments. It says, \ufffdO heed-taking eyesight, O narcissus-like eyes, where is your seeing? O wisdom-speaking tongue, where is your sweet talking? O painted, lovely face, where is your adornment and beauty? O you who came from dust, were supported by dust, were provided for by dust, were put back into dust, and became nothing in dust!\ufffdO father of dust, is not our creation from dust, and our return to dust?So what is the meaning of regret when we bury dust in dust, O father of dust!It is as if the King is saying, \ufffdOnce I make dust the cause of being, and then again I make it the cause of nonbeing. Thus the world's folk will know that I am perfectly powerful, and I give being to all that is.\ufffdO chevalier! If you ever pass through a graveyard, be careful to look at that encampment with an eye to taking heed."
