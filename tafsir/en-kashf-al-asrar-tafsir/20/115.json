First he was addressed by awesomeness. He saw the whip of rebuke, and he stepped into the street of fear and wept. Then he was sat down on gentleness. The beginningless solicitude arrived, he saw the crown of chosenness, and he was happy on the carpet of hope. Yes, it was a work already done, a decree made ready in the Beginningless. Adam had not yet slipped when the tailor of gentleness sewed the waistcoat of his repentance, and Iblis had not yet stepped into disobedience when the druggist of severity mixed the draft of the poison of his curse.The beginning of the traces of the beginningless solicitude for Adam was that the exalted majesty of the Unity Itself in Its perfect self-sufficiency took a handful of dust from the earth: \ufffdSurely God created Adam from a handful taken from the entire surface of the earth.\ufffd Then He placed it in the mold of the stature, as He said: \ufffdSurely We created man in the most beautiful stature\ufffd [95:4]. Then He brought him into the ferment of bringing to be: \ufffdHe fermented the clay of Adam in His hand for forty days.\ufffd Then He sat the spirit-king on the royal seat of his makeup: \ufffdI have blown into him of My spirit\ufffd [15:29]. Then He read out the edict of his vicegerency and sultanate in the kingdom of the beginningless: \ufffdSurely I am setting in the earth a vicegerent\ufffd [2:30]. He recorded the names of all existent things with the pen of the gentleness of Eternity on the tablet of his heart: \ufffdAnd He taught Adam the names, all of them\ufffd [2:31]. He commanded the glorifiers and hallowers of the Holy Pali-sades and the Gardens of Intimacy to prostrate themselves before the throne of his good fortune: \ufffdAnd when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam'\ufffd [2:34].Know that this level, distinction, and rank was not for the clay. Rather, it belonged to the sultan of the heart. In the core of Adam's heart He deposited one of the divine subtleties, royal secrets, and unseen meanings, a secret concealed by the curtain of Say: \ufffdThe spirit is of the command of my Lord\ufffd [17:85]."
