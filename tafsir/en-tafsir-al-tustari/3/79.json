Sawwār said, \ufffdThe person [whose knowledge derives from the] divine lordliness (rabbānī) is the one who does not choose anyone over his Lord, and it [the name] is derived from the word rubūbiyya\ufffd. Sahl continued:People whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (rabbāniyūn) are those who are elevated in the degree of [their] knowledge by virtue of [that] knowledge, just as Muḥammad b.

[On the other hand], ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said: those whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (rabbāniyyūn) are the collectivity of scholars. This resembles a saying of ʿAlī , \ufffdPeople are of three kinds: the knower whose knowledge derives from the divine lordliness (ʿālim rabbānī), the person acquiring knowledge (mutaʿallim) on the path to salvation, and the commoners and riff-raff, who follow every charlatan.
