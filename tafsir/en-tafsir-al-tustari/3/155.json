  "text": "Truly, those of you who turned back the day the two hosts met, truly, it was Satan who caused them to slip, because of some of what they had earned\ufffd[Sahl] was asked about the meaning of that earning (kasb). He said:It was the complacency that they felt because of their great numbers on the day of Ḥunayn and the glory they had gained on the Day of Badr. This was due to Satan coming to associatewith them, after [he saw] the acquiescence (musākana) of their hearts, and their regard for themselves, because of the complacency (iʿjāb) that their own lower selves had seduced them into. So God lifted His protection (ʿiṣma) from them as a punishment. Indeed, when the Prophet  heard his Companions say on the Day of Ḥunayn, \ufffdWe shall not be overcome by so few\ufffd, he warned them, \ufffdDo not wish to encounter the enemy, rather ask for safety (ʿāfiya) from God, Exalted is He\ufffd, from dependency on your own devising (tadbīr) in any situation, and from [being unaware of your] neediness (dūn al-iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He.See how when David  asked his Lord to join him with the ranks of Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, He replied, \ufffdYou are not on that level, O David.\ufffd He asked, \ufffdWhy is that O Lord?\ufffd, to which God replied, \ufffdBecause I tested them and they showed patience. Furthermore, they did not know the world and the world did not know them. But you have known the world and it has known you, and you adopted it as your kin.\ufffd David  said, \ufffdShow me one from among your servants who, if You tested him, would show patience.\ufffd Then God, Mighty and Majestic is He, said, \ufffdI\ufffdm going to test you.\ufffd Thus he [David] became the first to request affliction (balāʾ), ⸢and the one who exposed himself to⸣ testing (imtiḥān) from God, Exalted is He. That is to say, this was [of course] in accordance with God\ufffds prior knowledge in the veiled unseen, which is solely known to Him. Then Iblīs came to him in the form of a pigeon and the story took place involving Uriah b. Ḥanān. God did not protect [David] from desire, intent or action. However, He protectedJoseph from action, though He did not protect him from desire and intent. His words:"
