  "text": "God bears witness\ufffdHe [Sahl] said:That is, God knows and makes clear (bayyana) \ufffdthat there is no god but He. He is witness to Himself by Himself; and this is particular to His essence. He called to witness those of His creatures whom He called to witness before their creation, according to His knowledge. Consequently, the people possessed of His gnosis (maʿrifa) are made aware that He had full knowledge of everything that will be before it was actually brought into existence. Hence, [God\ufffds] oneness (tawḥīd) is independent of existentiated beings (dūn al-akwān), just as God was a witness to Himself by Himself before the existence of creation.ʿAbd al-Wāḥid said:I was with Ayyūb al-Sakhtiyānī when he saw a porter carrying wood. I asked him, \ufffdDo you have a Lord?\ufffd to which he replied, \ufffdIs the likes of me questioned about his Lord?\ufffd So I said to him, \ufffdIf you have a Creator as you claim, why do you work with wood?\ufffd Then the man indicated to the sky, and lo and behold, the wood became gold! We were both amazed by him on account of this. Then he said, \ufffdO God! I have no need for this\ufffd, so the gold turned back to wood just as it was before. So we said to him, \ufffdWhat led you to do this?\ufffd, to which he replied, \ufffdI am [God\ufffds] slave, so I carry this in order that I should not forget who I am.\ufffd His words:"
