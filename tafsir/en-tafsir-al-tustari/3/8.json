  "text": "Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to deviate after You have guided us\ufffdThat is, \ufffdDo not let our hearts turn away from faith after You have guided us with guidance from Yourself\ufffd; \ufffdBut grant us mercy from You, ⸢that is, stability (thabāt)⸣ \ufffdYou are the One who bestows, upon those who return to You in a state of neediness, entreaty and lowliness.Then Sahl said:The only stratagem (ḥīla) that the servant has is to establish the practice throughout his life of saying, \ufffdMy Lord! Protect me! Protect me! Keep me safe! Keep me safe! Help me! Help me!\ufffd God, Exalted is He, has said, As He brought you into being, so shall you return [7:29].Every person who affirms God\ufffds oneness should know for a certainty that not everyone who loves God (Ḥaqq) is loved by Him, for Iblīs encountered Him with the ⸢outward sign⸣ of love and said, \ufffdShall I prostrate before one whom You have created from clay [17:61], when You are God, and it is not permissible to worship other than You?\ufffd Consequently God cursed him. Therefore, not all those who try to draw close to God are accepted by Him. Nor does God accept the obedience (ṭāʿa) of all who obey Him. Truly He perceives what is in the conscience (ḍamīr) [of all His creatures]. Thus, no one can feel secure that God will not deal with him in the same way that He dealt with Iblīs. God cursed him with the lights of His protection (bi-anwār ʿiṣmatihi) such that he was always in reality under His curse, but God veiled him from what had been foreordained [for him] from Him, up until the time when He punished him by bringing it to realisation through him. Thus, the servant can do nothing except continually [implore] help (ghawth) from God. Indeed the Messenger  said, \ufffdO You who make the steadfast firm, make me firm with Your firmness (thabāt)! O You whose oneness is unchanging, for there is no god except You, Glorified are You! Truly I have been among the wrongdoers.\ufffd He wouldalso say: \ufffdO Lord and Protector (walī) of Islam and its people, make me firm in Islam until I encounter You!\ufffd [Sahl] said [on this matter], \ufffdThe place of faith in God, Exalted is He, is the heart and the place of Islam is the breast, and it is subject to increase and decrease.\ufffd His words:"
