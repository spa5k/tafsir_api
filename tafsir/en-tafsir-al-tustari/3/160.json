  "text": "If God helps you, then no one can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then who is there who can help you after Him?...He said:To be forsaken (khidhl훮n) means to be utterly abandoned (gh훮yat al-tark). As for abandonment itself (tark), that is for the sinner who recognises his sin. Being forsaken (khidhl훮n), however, is for the one who sins while believing that he is doing something good. This is God\ufffds punishment to the one who is forsaken, for He upholds him in sin, having the knowledge both of his sin and of his subsequent procrastination of repentance. Do you not see how Ibl카s, when he refused [to obey], and persisted in that refusal was forsaken by God due to His prior knowledge about him? This is because He willed from him that which was in accordance with His knowledge; He did not will from him that which was in accordance with His command. However Adam , because he was not forsaken in his abandonment, confessed to his sin after committing it and returned to his Lord, Majestic and Mighty is He, and his repentance was accepted.His words, Exalted is He:"
