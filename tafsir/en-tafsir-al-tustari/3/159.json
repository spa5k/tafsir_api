  "text": "It was by the mercy of God that you [Muḥammad] were lenient with them\ufffdThis means, \ufffdDue to an act of sympathy (ʿaṭf ) from God you dealt gently with them\ufffd, And if you had been harsh, with [your] tongue, and fierce of heart, they would have dispersed from about you, that is, \ufffdThey would have separated themselves from you\ufffd. So pardon them, that is, \ufffdOverlook their faults\ufffd, and ask forgiveness for them, for their defeat on the Day of Uḥud. Consult them in the matter, that is, \ufffdDo not distance them from yourself because of their disobedience, but accommodate them through your graciousness (faḍl), for it is through Us that you pardon, through Us that you seek forgiveness, and to Us that you turn for guidance\ufffd. Then, when you are resolved, that is, \ufffdIf you wish to carry something out after consultation\ufffd, put your trust in God\ufffd, that is, \ufffdRely on God notwithstanding that [consultation], consign all your affairs to Him, and depend on Him without regard for anyone else.\ufffd He [the Prophet] did not leave this world before God, Exalted is He, had disclosed to his heart realms of knowledge which were between him and God, Exalted is He, without any intermediary, due to his love of pondering and reflection, in reverent awareness (iʿtibār) of the omnipotence of his Lord, so that he attained an increase from God most High, just as He was commanded in the words of God, Exalted is He, But say: \ufffdMy Lord! Increase me in knowledge\ufffd [20:114]. Furthermore, he enjoined this upon his nation (umma), as is related from the Prophet  in his words, \ufffdConsult those who are mindful of God (muttaqūn), who have preferred the Hereafter over this world, and who give you priority over themselves in your affairs.\ufffd And he also said, \ufffdConsult the righteous scholars, and when you have made your resolve to carry something out, put your trust in God.\ufffdHe [Sahl] said [in this regard]:Fraternise with brothers among the people who are mindful of God, and let the person whom you consult be one of those who fear God, Exalted is He. Let your word not be broken. And never be hostile to anyone until you know the states of his conduct with God, Exalted is He."
