But celebrate the glory of your Lord\ufffdThat is, \ufffdPray to God, Exalted is He, and remember Him\ufffd, for it is as if God, Exalted is He, had said to him: \ufffdIf your heart is weighed down because of your proximity to the disbelievers and the calumny of that which they are ascribing to Us in the way of adversaries, rivals and partners through their ignorance and envy, then return to the state of witnessing Us (mushāhada) and proximity to Us (qurb) through remembering Us, truly it is with Us that you have proximity, and it is in remembering and witnessing Us that your happiness [lies]. Furthermore, have forbearance with this [suffering], for in it [that forbearance] is My good pleasure (riḍā). It was related that Moses  said: \ufffdO my Lord! Guide me to an action by which I will gain Your good pleasure.\ufffdHe continued:Then God sent the revelation to him: \ufffdO son of ʿImrān, truly My good pleasure is in [subjecting you to] what you detest, [but] you will not be able to bear that.\ufffdHe then said:Then Moses  fell down in prostration, weeping and said: \ufffdO Lord! You privileged me with [hearing] Your speech, for You did not speak to any human being before me, yet You have not guided me to an action by which I can gain Your good pleasure.\ufffd Then God, Exalted is He, revealed to him saying: \ufffdVerily My good pleasure is in your contentment with My decree (riḍāʾī fī riḍāka bi-qaḍāʾī).\ufffdHe was asked about His words, Exalted is He:"
