For indeed there are among this nation (umma) those who are gathered up from their graves [and taken] directly to Paradise, who do not attend the reckoning (ḥisāb), or experience any of the horrors [of the day]. They are those of whom God, Exalted is He, says, they will be kept away from it [21:101]. And indeed the Prophet  said: \ufffdVerily, the friends of God (awliyāʾ Allāh) leave their graves for Paradise and they do not stop for the reckoning, nor do they fear the length of that day. They are the first to reach Paradise. God is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. That is the great triumph [5:119].\ufffdHis words, Exalted is He:"
