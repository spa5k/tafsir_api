  "text": "And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon\ufffdThat is, you fell into discord concerning it. Why then did you slay them, if you speak the truth? [3:183] Sahl said regarding these words:This is a reproach from God, Mighty and Majestic is He, to them [the Jews] with regard to those of their forefathers who were murderers of prophets. As you know, those who are addressed in this verse had not killed a prophet at the time of the Prophet , nor was there at that time any other Prophet but him. However, God addressed them with reference to those who came before them among their kin, as He addressed the Prophet  with what was in reality directed to his nation [as a whole] with His words: O Prophet! When you [men] divorce women, divorce them by their prescribed period [65:1] The same [principle applies] to His words: About what are they questioning one another?! About the awesome tidings [78:1, 2], [by which is meant], \ufffdFor what reason do you question the Prophet , when he is more knowledgeable concerning that\ufffd."
