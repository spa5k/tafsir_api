  "text": "They are those on whom [descend] blessings from their Lord, and mercy; it is they who are truly guided.Sahl said:What is implied by blessings (ṣalawāt) upon them is the bestowal of mercy (taraḥḥum) upon them, that is, a bestowal of mercy from their Lord. The Prophet  said, \ufffdMay God bless the family of Abū Awfāʾ, when they brought him charitable donations, by which he meant \ufffd[May God] have mercy on them.\ufffd He also said:Muḥammad b. Sawwār told us on the authority of Abū ʿAmr b. ʿAlāʾ that he said: \ufffdṢalāt\ufffd has three meanings, one of which is the prescribed prayer with its bowings and prostrations, which is referred to when God says: So pray to Your Lord and sacrifice [108:2], that is, grasp your left arm with your right hand in prayer, in self-abasement and in awe before God, Exalted is He. Thisis also reported from ʿAlī . The second meaning is to show mercy (taraḥḥum) [as discussed above], and the third meaning is supplication (duʿāʾ), as [for example] in the prayer over the dead. Indeed, the Prophet  said: \ufffdIf any of you are invited for a meal, you should [accept the invitation]. But if [the one invited] is fasting he should pray\ufffd, that is, he should make a supplicationfor them to be endowed with blessing. Furthermore, the Prophet  said in a ḥadīth, \ufffd\ufffdand may the angels pray over you\ufffd, meaning pray for mercy to be bestowed upon you. In this [same] ḥadīth the Prophet  went on to say, \ufffdAnd if someone eats at his house, the angels pray over him [the host] until eventide\ufffd, meaning the angels supplicate for him. Sahl continued:Ṣalāt carries two meanings: one is the seeking of forgiveness (istighfār), and the other is forgiveness itself (maghfira). As for the meaning of \ufffdseeking forgiveness\ufffd, it is referred to in His words, And pray for them [9:103], that is, ask forgiveness for them; [and in His words], to [secure] the prayers of the Messenger [9:99], meaning asking for the Messenger\ufffds supplication for forgiveness."
