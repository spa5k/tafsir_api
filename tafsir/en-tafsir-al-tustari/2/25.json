  "text": "\ufffdThey shall be given it [the fruits] in perfect semblance; \ufffdand there for them shall be spouses, purified\ufffd,He replied:In Paradise there are no carpets, vessels, clothes, perfume, birds or plants, nor any fruits [as we know them]. Thus the semblance that the things of this world bear to those [mentioned in the verse] is no more than a coincidence in their names. So the pomegranate of this world does not in the least resemble the pomegranate in Paradise, except in name. The same is the case with resemblance of the date, the jujube and other such fruits [to those of Paradise]. What is intended in His saying in [perfect] semblance is only a likeness in colour, for there is a differencein taste. When in Paradise the angels bring an apple to the friends of God (awliyāʾ) during the day, and then they bring them another during the night, and they ask, \ufffdIs this one [like the other]?\ufffd They are told, \ufffdTaste it\ufffd, and on tasting it they experience a different taste to that of the first one. It should not be discounted from God\ufffds ability, Exalted is He, that He could make an apple taste like a pomegranate, almond or quince.\ufffdSahl continued:Indeed I know one of the friends of God (awliyāʾ) who saw on the seashore a man who had before him the biggest pomegranate that there ever was. The friend of God (walī) asked him what he had before him, to which he replied, \ufffdIt is a pomegranate that I saw in Paradise. I desired it so God granted it to me, but when He placed it before me I regretted my haste for having it while still in this world.\ufffd That man [the walī] asked, \ufffdMay I eat some of it?\ufffd and the man responded, \ufffdIf you have the capacity to eat it, then do so\ufffd; upon which he grabbed the fruit from him and ate most of it. When the man saw him eating the fruit he it was astounded and said, \ufffdReceive glad tidings of Paradise, for I did not know your [spiritual] rank before you ate it; no one eats of the food of Paradise in this life except the people of Paradise.\ufffdThen Abū Bakr asked Sahl if the one who had eaten the pomegranate had informed him of its taste, to which he replied:He did, and its taste brings together the tastes of all fruits, and in addition it has a smoothness and coolness which is unlike any of the tastes [experienced] in this world.Then Abū Bakr commented, \ufffdI have no doubt, nor does anyone who heard this story from Sahl, that he himself was in fact both the possessor of that pomegranate and the one who ate it.\ufffdSahl was asked about His words:"
