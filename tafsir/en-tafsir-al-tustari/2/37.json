Sawwār informed me, [in a narration] from his father, from al-Thawrī, from ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. Rafīʿ, on the authority of ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar y, that he [the latter] said: \ufffdWhen Adam  recalled his error he said: \ufffdO Lord, do you see the act of disobedience by which I disobeyed You as something that You preordained for me before You created me, or somethingthat I initiated?\ufffd He replied: \ufffdIndeed, it is something that I preordained for you, that you would do as a consequence of My lifting My protection from you, fifty thousand years before creating you.\ufffd Then Adam  asked, \ufffdAs you preordained it for me, then forgive me, for indeed We have wronged our own souls [7:23], through carrying out the lower self\ufffds desire and relying on its devising, and we have repented from ever going back to that. If You do not forgive us \ufffd that is, in this life, and have mercy upon us, during what remains of our lives we shall surely be among the lost [7:23] \ufffd that is, among the damned and tormented in the Hereafter.\ufffd\ufffdSo these were the words which God, Exalted is He, was speaking about when He said: Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, and his Lord relented towards him, truly He is the Relenting, the Merciful.It was related from the Prophet  that he said: \ufffdAdam asked Moses, (peace be upon them both), \ufffdHow many years before my creation do you find that my sin was destined for me?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdForty thousand years.\ufffd\ufffd The Prophet  then said, \ufffdThus did Adam confute Moses (peace be upon them both).\ufffd Sahl was asked about God\ufffds words:[2:30]\ufffdWhilst we glorify You with praise and sanctify You\ufffdIt means \ufffdWe purify ourselves for Your sake by saying what You inspired us to say through the favour that You bestowed upon us. Blessed are You, O our Lord!\ufffd"
