Whoever learns the Qurʾān and acts according to it, it is as if prophethood were incorporated within him, except that he does not receive revelation. He is called to account in the same way as the prophets except in the matter of conveying the message.\ufffd And Muḥammad b. Sawwār reported to me from ʿAqīl, from Ibn al-Musayyab, on the authorityof Abū Hurayra  that he stated that the Prophet  said, \ufffdThe Qurʾān is wisdom, andwhoever learns the Qurʾān in his youth, it mingles with his flesh and blood. And surely the Fire cannot touch a heart which contains the Qurʾān, nor a body which avoids that which it prohibits (maḥārim), and keeps to what it permits (ḥalāl), believes in that which is clear [in it] (muḥkam), refrains from judgement in that which is ambiguous [in it] (mutashābih), and does not make innovations regarding it.\ufffd Mujāhid and Ṭāwūs said, \ufffdWisdom is the Qurʾān, as He says in Sūrat al-Naḥl, Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom [16:125], meaning the Qurʾān. Ḥasan said, \ufffdWisdom is the understanding of the Qurʾān, and wisdom is prophethood, as He says in Sūrat Ṣād, and gave him wisdom\ufffd [38:20], meaning prophethood (nubuwwa). And God said [concerning] David , And God gave him kingship and wisdom [2:251] meaning prophethood, along with the Book. Qatāda said, \ufffdWisdom is understanding the religion of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and following the Messenger of God \ufffd; Suddī said: \ufffdWisdom is prophethood\ufffd; Zayd b."
