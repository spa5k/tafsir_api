  "text": "God charges no soul save to its capacity\ufffd[Sahl said]:That is, what it can bear; \ufffdfor it, is what it has merited\ufffd, that is, its reward for righteous deed[s], \ufffdand against it, is what it has earned\ufffd, meaning, the burden of sins.\ufffdThen he said:Whoever is not concerned with his past sins will not be protected in the days that remain. Moreover, whoever is not protected in his remaining days will be among those who perish on their final return.He was asked, \ufffdWhen does a man know his own sins?\ufffd He replied:When he preserves the lights of his heart and does not allow anything to enter it or depart from it without [first] weighing it up, then he will know his own sins. Furthermore, whoever opens for himself a door to goodness, will find that God opens for him seventy doors to divinely-bestowed success (tawfīq). On the other hand, whoever opens for himself a door to evil, will find that God opens to him seventy doors to evil whence the servant will not know. Every heart that preoccupies itself with that which does not concern it will be punished immediately by missing out on that which is its [genuine] concern at that moment (fī\ufffdl-ḥāl). No one knows this except those who know God."
