  "text": "And do not obscure the truth with falsehood, and do not conceal truth wittingly.Sahl was asked about this verse, to which he replied:This means, \ufffdDo not cover up a matter of the Hereafter because of a worldly concern.\ufffd What [God] means is that it is not allowed for the people of truth to conceal the truth from the people of truth (ahl al-ḥaqq) in particular, or from those who long to be guided thereby to God. As for the people of truth, they will increase in insight (baṣīra) [through hearing it], and as for those who are not of the elite of the people of truth, the words of God are a source of guidance for them and of direction to God, Exalted is He."
