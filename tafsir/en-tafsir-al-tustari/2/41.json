The Prophet  also said: \ufffdIf gnosis (maʿrifa) had remained firmly rooted in the heart of David  and he had not slipped into negligence, he would not have fallen into disobedience.\ufffd By my life, truly gnosis (maʿrifa) was enclosed within its own abodes (udrijat fī awṭānihā), in order that what was contained within God\ufffds prior knowledge concerning him would befall him. This is because it [God\ufffds prior knowledge] inevitably had to be manifested in his qualities, since God\ufffds knowledge is a final decree that cannot change to other than what the All-Knowing knows, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed God, Mighty and Majestic is He, concealed [from David]"
