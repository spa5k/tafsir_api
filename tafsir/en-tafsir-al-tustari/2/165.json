  "text": "(Yet there are people who take to themselves idols), loving them as if loving God; but those who believe love God more ardently\ufffdHe said:It means that they love idols (andād) in the way that they love God, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, described the intensity of their disbelief and their constancy (ṣidq) in the state of disbelief as ignorance (jahl). He then described the love of the believers and their constancy in the state of faith in God, as truth (ḥaqq). Then He accorded superiority to the believers due to their knowledge [or gnosis, maʿrifa], saying, those who believe love God more ardently. This is due to their knowledge (maʿrifa), and all the other things that cause the believing servant to advance towards God and establish His remembrance. This is the level ofthe loving mystics (ʿārifūn muḥibbūn), since love is the inclination (ʿaṭf) for the purest reality (khāliṣat al-ḥaqq), which God, Exalted is He, [produces] in them.He was asked, \ufffdWhat is the sign of love?\ufffd He replied:It is the embracing of obedience and the relinquishing of [any sense] of need [for other than God] (mubāyanat al-fāqa). It has been related that God, Exalted is He, said in a revelation to Moses, \ufffdDo you know why I cast my love upon you?\ufffd, to which he replied, \ufffdNo, O Lord.\ufffd He said, \ufffdBecause you sought My delight (masarra). O Moses, [always] keep Me in mind, and don\ufffdt forget Me in any situation. Let your aspiration (himma) be for My remembrance (dhikr), for I will take care of your path.\ufffd But God, Transcendent and Exalted is He, knows best."
