The commandand prohibition are from Him; protection and the granting of success are from Him; and reward and punishment are from Him. However, actions are attributed (manṣūba) to the children of Adam, so whoever performs a good action must express gratitude to merit thereby an increase [in goodness]; and whoever performs a wicked act must seek forgiveness, so that he thereby merits forgiveness. Affliction from God is of two kinds: an affliction of mercy and an affliction of punishment. An affliction of mercy leads the afflicted person to show his utter need (iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and leads him to the abandonment of devising(tadbīr). However, an affliction of punishment leads the afflicted person [to rely] on his own choice (ikhtiyār) and devising.Sahl was then asked, \ufffdWhich is more difficult, patience (ṣabr) in [a state of] well-being or patience during adversity?\ufffd He replied:Asking for safety (salāma) in times of security is more difficult than asking for safety in [a state of] fear.[On the same subject] Sahl said regarding His words, And if anyone believes in God, [God] guides his heart [aright] [64:11], \ufffd[Whoever] believes in God and that his affliction comes from God, will find his heart guided by God to the expectation of relief (intiẓār al-faraj) from Him\ufffd.His words:[5:2] \ufffdHelp one another to righteousness and mindfulness of God\ufffdThat is, to the performance of the obligatory acts, for righteousness (birr) is faith (īmān), and the performance of obligatory acts is a branch (farʿ) of faith."
