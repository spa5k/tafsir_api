They do not repose in anything other than Him and they do not fear anything other than Him, their [only source of] anxiety being the possibility of separation from Him, just as He says, and who are apprehensive of the chastisement of their Lord [70:27].The saying is narrated from the Prophet : �According to what the highest host in the highest ranks informed me, among the best of my nation are people who laugh out loud at the amplitude of the mercy of their Lord, and weep in secret out of fear of the severity of the punishment of their Lord. They remember their Lord morning and night in His blessed houses, and make supplications to Him with their tongues in hope and fear. They petition Him with their hands, lowering [their upturned palms] and raising them, and they long for Him constantly with their hearts. Their demands on people are light, but their demands on themselves heavy. They tread upon the earth [lightly] with their feet, as an ant would tread, without gloating, boasting or swaggering�� to the end of the ḥadīth. His words, Exalted is He:"

He confides with them (yusārruhum) due to His knowledge of all the suggestions(khawāṭir) and aspirations (himam) which are within it [the self]. On the other hand, they confide in Him by showing their neediness for Him and seeking refuge in Him.Furthermore, if the heart acquiesces in that which the evil whispering of the Enemy suggests to it, even though it may be the most insignificant thing, it will manifest itself in the breast, and from the breast to the body and thus will he have betrayed God�s trust (amāna), His pledge (ʿahd) and faith (īmān)."
