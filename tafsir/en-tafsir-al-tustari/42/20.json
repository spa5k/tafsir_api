  "text": "And whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will enhance for him his harvest\ufffdHe said:The harvest of the Hereafter is being satisfied [with one\ufffds lot] (qanāʿa) in this world, and [finding]contentment (riḍā) in the Hereafter. The harvest of this world is that which is sought other than Him.He [also] said:Another shade of meaning is that he who acts for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, in a state of compliance (ījāban), without seeking a reward, [will find that] everything which is sought other than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, becomes diminished in his sight. Thus, he desires neither the world, nor Paradise, but desires only the vision (naẓar) of Him, this being the share (ḥaẓẓ) of the intuition of the spiritual self (dhihn nafs al-rūḥ), the understanding of the intellect (fahm al-ʿaql), and the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb), as when He addressed them [before] (ka-mā khāṭabahum); for conformity [lit. imitation, iqtidāʾ], on that occasion was without the presence of the natural self (nafs ṭabīʿiyya). Notwithstanding the fact that the [natural] self receives a share [of the beatific vision in Paradise], like a fragrant breeze, due to its being fused with those lights. [However,] whoever acts for the sake of this world, \ufffdWe will give him of it, but in the Hereafterhe will have no portion (naṣīb), for his ⸢natural⸣ self will be occupied with the enjoyment (tanaʿʿum or naʿīm) of Paradise, which itself is its share (ḥaẓẓ), [while forgoing] its portion in the Hereafter, namely the vision of God for eternity (ruʾyat al-Ḥaqq ʿalā\ufffdl-abad). His words, Exalted is He:"
