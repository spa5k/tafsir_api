  "text": "O you who have faith, remember God with much remembrance! In terms of allusion what is understood from this verse is calling people to love the Real, for MuṣṬafā said, “When someone loves something, he remembers it much.” The mark of friendship is plentiful remembrance. Friendship does not let the tongue be at ease from remembrance or the heart be empty of remembrance. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “The remembrance of the Friend is the portion of the yearners. It is the brightness of the eyes, the good fortune of the spirit, and the adornment of the world. An iota's increase in friendship is better than the two worlds. One breath in companionship with the Friend is the everlasting kingdom-exalted is the servant who is worthy of that! What is this work? For it has no name and no mark. It is the servant's occupation, but hidden from the servant. The servant is unable to bear it but stretches out to reach it. By God, he who seeks it is joyful in the midst of fire.” Though Your hand be fire, it is my bed of roses. All that comes from You is sweet, whether healing or pain."
