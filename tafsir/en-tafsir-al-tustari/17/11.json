  "text": "And man prays for ill as [avidly] as he prays for good...Sahl said:The soundest of supplications is the remembrance (dhikr) [of God], and relinquishing the choice [that is made] through petitioning and supplication, for remembrance [itself] suffices. For it may be that when a person supplicates, he asks for something that will lead to his ruin without realising it. Do you not see that God, Exalted is He, says, And man prays for ill as [avidly] as he prays for good? The one who remembers [God] constantly, and who abandons choice (ikhtiyār), supplication (duʿāʾ) and petitioning (suʾāl), will be granted the best that could be desired, and the ills of petitioning and choice will fall away from him. For this reason the Messenger of God  said, \ufffdTo those whose remembrance of Me kept them from petitioning Me, I will grant the best that petitioners ask for.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
