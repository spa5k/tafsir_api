This signifies that I will not incline to anyone, and that I will not fall short in observing the limits and conditions in conveying it. Also grant me a safe exit [from this world], seeking Your good pleasure in [upholding] it with conformity (muwāfaqa) [to Your will]. And grant me from Yourself a supporting authority (sulṭānan naṣīran).\ufffd That is, \ufffdAdorn me with the adornmentof Your dominion (jabarūt), so that the authority of truth prevails over them and not the authority of desire.\ufffdAnd on another occasion I heard Sahl say:\ufffdAnd grant me from Yourself a supporting authority [refers to having] a tongue which speaks on the authority of (ʿan) You and no one else.His words, Exalted is He:"
