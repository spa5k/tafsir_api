He also said:The best form of purification (ṭahāra) is that the servant purifies himself from [the illusion of] his own power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa). Every act or saying that is not accompanied by the words: �there is no power or strength save in God�, will not have God�s support, Mighty and Majestic is He. Furthermore, every saying which is not accompanied by the proviso, will incur a punishment for [the person who said it], even if it was an act [or saying] of righteousness.And for every affliction (muṣība) which is received without being accompanied by the saying of �return� (istirjāʿ), the afflicted person will not be given steadfastness when facing it [affliction] on the Day of Resurrection.He said:According to Ibn ʿAbbās y, al-falaq means the morning (ṣubḥ) while according to al-Ḍaḥḥāk it refers to a valley in the Hellfire. [On the other hand], according to Wuhayb it refers to a chamber in Hell, and according to Ḥasan it refers to a well in Hell.It has also been said that He intended by it all people (jamīʿ al-khalq). Or it has been said that it refers to the rock from which water springs forth."

Aʿṣam al-Yahūdī cast into the well of Banū Bayāḍa a spell against the Prophet, who used to frequent it. [One day as] he headed towards [the well] the spell [cast against him] possessed him and the Prophet  became affected by it, so God sent down the two sūras of seeking refuge (muʿawwidhatayn), and the Angel Gabriel  informed him of the magic spell. Then he sent two men among the Companions to [the well] and theytook it [the knot] out of the well. They brought it to the Prophet , upon which he started to untie the knot reciting the verses the while, so that the Messenger  was cured without delay after having completed the two sūras.After this occurrence, Labīd used to go to the Prophet  but he did not see any trace of [his spell] on the face of the Prophet , neither did he mention to him [what he had done]."

It has also been said [that it means]: when night first encroaches on [lit. �penetrates,� dakhala] the day, [that is], when night is just beginning, devils among the jinn are released and anyone who is afflicted in that hour will not recover.Sahl [also] said regarding and from the evil of darkness when it gathers:Its inner meaning refers to remembrance, when regard for the self enters it, thereby screening it from sincerity towards God in the remembrance [purely] of Him.and from the evil of the women-blowers,That is, the sorceresses who blow on knots."
