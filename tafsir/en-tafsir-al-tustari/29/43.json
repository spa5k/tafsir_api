  "text": "And such similitudes We strike for [the sake of] mankind, but none understands them except those who know.He said:The similitudes which God strikes for man are available for everyone [to see], since the evidences of [His] omnipotence (qudra) are [in themselves] proof of the [existence of] the Omnipotent. However, it is only His elect (khāṣṣa) who fully understand them. Thus, knowledge is rare and understanding granted by God (fiqh ʿan Allāh) even rarer. Whoever becomes acquainted with the knowledge ⸢of Him through the knowledge [acquired by]⸣ his natural self (bi-ʿilm nafsihi al-ṭabīʿiyya), will experience Him in a delusory manner. But regarding the one who becomes acquainted with [God] through the knowledge of God, God knows what He willed from him for Himself (fa\ufffdLlāhu ʿarafa murādahu minhu li-nafsihi). The creature has no knowledge of God beyond that. This allusion (ishāra) [to similitudes in the verse] was made due to the fact that their hearts are truly far away from knowledge [of God]. Take note of ⸢his words,  \ufffdIf you knew God with a true knowledge of Him (ḥaqq maʿrifatihi) then the mountain would cease to exist by [the power of] your supplication\ufffd⸣. His words:"
