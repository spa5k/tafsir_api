You keep the world away from Your believing servant and expose him to affliction!\ufffd And He says to the angels, \ufffdReveal to the others his [the believing servant\ufffds] reward.\ufffd When they see his reward they say, \ufffdWhatever he suffers in this world will not harm him.\ufffd He [Tustarī] said:Let your prayer (ṣalāt) be forbearance (ṣabr) in the face of suffering (baʾsāʾ), your fasting (ṣawm) be to observe silence (ṣamt), and your charity (ṣadaqa) be to refrain from doing harm [to anybody] (kaff al-adhā).
