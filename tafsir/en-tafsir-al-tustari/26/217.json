I brought you out from the depths of the ocean of power and displayed you to the world's folk so that the whole world would take on the color of your being's beauty. I created all for your sake, and I created you for My sake. Support yourself with Me and entrust yourself totally to Me. O MuḤammad, Adam was still between caresses and harshness when I inscribed gentleness in your heart and, with the hand of generosity, poured the wine of ap- proval for you to taste. I lifted up the curtain between Myself and you, and I showed Myself to your spirit.”"
