By the Pen, and by what they inscribe!He said:�Al-Nūn� is one of the names of God, Exalted is He, for if the opening letters of the sūras, Alif Lām Rā, Ḥā Mīm and Nūn, are joined together they make up the name al-Raḥmān. Ibn ʿAbbās y said: �Al-Nūn is the ink-well (dawāt) from which the Reminder (dhikr) [the Qurʾān] was written, and the Pen is that with which the Wise Reminder was written.�By what they inscribe � ⸢the Reminder which is written on the Preserved Tablet concerning the [divinely decreed] wretchedness (shaqāwa) or felicity (saʿāda) [of human beings].Ibn ʿAbbās has said in another report, �Nūn is the fish upon which rest the worlds (arḍūn),⸣ what they inscribe is the deeds of the children of Adam which the recording angels have written down.� ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said:By what they inscribe means: By the writing (kitāba) [i.e. the scripture] which God has undertaken[to provide] for His servants, which contains benefits (manāfiʿ) for people, and things that are in the best interests (maṣāliḥ) of His servants and their lands.His words, Exalted is He:"

However, when he gives up relying on his own strength, weakness will take68 Al-Qalam (or Nūn)243up residence in his soul, and this will generate mercy (raḥma) and benevolence (luṭf) from him, which is to take on the characteristics of the Lord, may His majesty be magnified.God, Exalted is He, addressed David  through inspiration, saying, �Take on My characteristics,for verily I am the Forbearing (al-Ṣabūr).� Whoever is given good character (khulq ḥasan) has been given the greatest station (aʿẓam al-maqāmāt), for all other stations are connected to the common folk (ʿāmma), whereas good character is connected with the [divine] attributes (ṣifāt) and qualities (nuʿūt). Sahl was asked one day about charismatic gifts (karāmāt) and he said:What are charismatic gifts (karāmāt)? Truly charismatic gifts are phenomena which will not last beyond their designated time.
