  "text": "those who make a pretence [at worship],He said:This refers to the hidden form of association [idolatry] (shirk), for the hypocrites would perform their prayers well at the mosques, but when they were out of the sight of the Muslims, they would become lazy in performing them. Do you not notice how firstly He confirmed that they were among those who pray, then He threatened them with a warning. Know that association [idolatry] (shirk) is of two kinds: the association regarding God as such, Mighty and Majestic is He, and the association in a person\ufffds dealing[s] (muʿāmala). Theassociation concerning [God] Himself is unforgivable. But as for the association in a person\ufffds dealing[s], ⸢this is subject to a stern threat (waʿīd shadīd), and it is subject to the divine will (mashīʾat Allāh).He was asked about the meaning of \ufffdassociation regarding his dealings\ufffd, and he replied:⸣ It is as in the case of someone [who] makes the pilgrimage and prayers in the knowledge that other people will praise him for it. This is hidden association. In a tradition it is related, \ufffdDevote your works solely to God, for God accepts only what is sincere in a deed. And do not say, \ufffdThis is for God\ufffd [for example] when you tie the bonds of kinship (raḥm); that is for kinship, there is nothing in it for God. ⸢Neither will it expiate [for you] any misdeed (maẓlama).⸣\ufffd Indeed, when Muʿādh requested of the Prophet , \ufffdCounsel me, O Messenger of God.\ufffd He [the Prophet ] said, \ufffdBe sincere to God and a small amount of deeds will suffice you.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
