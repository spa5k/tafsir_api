What is meant is: �Let me die as one who has committed his affairs over to You and handed over his concerns to You, so that I have no recourse to my lower self under any condition, and do not resort to managing things [for myself] (tadbīr) by means of any secondary cause (sabab) whatsoever.His words, Exalted is He:"

However, the outer meaning of the verse refers to the fact that the polytheists among the Arabs believe in God, just as He has said, If you ask them, who created them, they will certainly say �God��[43:87] Even so they are polytheists who believe in some of the messengers but do not believe in others.His words, Exalted is He:"

Nor have they witnessed [it], for if they had witnessedit, the whole matter would be over, and that is a grave matter. Then he [Sahl] said:The People of �There is no God but God� are many but the sincere among them are few. But God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"

He said:By knowing that God, Exalted is He, is with you, and by the comfort of the [concomitant sense of] well-being (bi-rāḥat al-ʿāfiya). Patience may be compared to a bowl which has patience at the top and honey underneath. Then he said:I am amazed at the one who is not patient.

      "text": "�Yet I do not exculpate my own soul; verily the soul is ever inciting to evil�� He [Sahl] said:Truly, the [evil-]inciting self (nafs ammāra) is lust (shahwa), which is the role played by man�s [basic] nature (ṭabʿ); ��unless my Lord shows mercy�, is the role played by the [divine] protection (ʿiṣma). The self at peace (nafs muṭmaʾinna) is the self of gnosis (nafs al-maʿrifa). God, Exalted is He, created the self and made ignorance its nature (ṭabʿ) and made desire (hawā) the closest thing to it. He also made desire the door by which man�s ruin enters.Sahl was asked about the meaning of [a person�s] nature (ṭabʿ) and how one might necessarily acquire protection from it. He said:Human nature (ṭabʿ) comprises four natural dispositions (ṭabāʾiʿ): the first is the animal disposition(ṭabʿ al-bahāʾim), that of the stomach and genitals; the second is the satanic disposition (ṭabʿ al-shayāṭīn), that of play (laʿb) and diversion (lahw); the third is the sorcerous disposition (ṭabʿ al-saḥara), that of delusion (makr) and deception (khidāʿ); and the fourth is the devilishnature (ṭabʿ al-abālisa), that of refusal (ibāʾ) and arrogance (istikbār). [Divine] protection (ʿiṣma) against the animal disposition is through faith (īmān). Safety (salāma) from the satanic disposition is through glorification (tasbīḥ) and sanctification [of God] (taqdīs), which is the natural disposition of angels. Safety from the sorcerous disposition is through truthfulness (ṣidq), sincere counsel (naṣīḥa), equity (inṣāf) and graciousness (tafaḍḍul). Safety from the devilish nature is through taking refuge (iltijāʾ) in God, Exalted is He, by humbly imploring him (taḍarruʿ) and crying out to Him (ṣarākh). The nature of the intellect (ʿaql) is to have knowledge but the nature of the lower self (nafs) is ignorance. The natural disposition of [human] nature is [to make] pretentious claims (daʿwā).His words, Exalted is He:"

Sahl said:It means being impaired (fāsid) in body and in deed because of grief. His grief was only on account of Joseph�s religion and not for the sake of [Joseph] himself, for he knew that if he died upon his religion he would be united with him in the Hereafter that is everlasting, but if he changed his religion they would never be united ever again. It was related from Sufyān that he said, �Verily when the one bringing good tidings [of Joseph] came to Jacob , he asked him, �What was his religion when you left him?� He replied, �It was the religion of submission to God (islām).� So Jacob said, �Now the blessing is complete.��His words, Exalted is He:"
