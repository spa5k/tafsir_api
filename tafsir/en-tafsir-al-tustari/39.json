Or if He should desire some mercy for me, that is, in granting me forbearance (ṣabr) in avoidingwhat He has forbidden, and assistance (maʿūna) in carrying out what He has commanded, and in granting me full reliance (ittikāl) on Him at the end [of my life], [could they withhold His mercy?].And he said:Mercy (raḥma) is well-being (ʿāfiya) in one�s religion, in this world and in the Hereafter.

      "text": "God takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that have not died, in their sleep�He said:When God takes the souls (anfus) to Himself, He extracts the luminous spirit (rūḥ nūrī) from the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the dense natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ al-kathīf). The taking up [of souls] (al-tawaffī) in God�s Book is of three kinds: the first is death (mawt), the second, sleep (nawm), and the third, ascension (rafʿ). Death is as we have just mentioned. Sleep is as [described] in His words: and those that have not died, in their sleep, which means that He also takes unto Himself (yatawaffā) those who have not died, in their sleep (manām). [God also] said, It is He who takes you at night [6:60] meaning, in sleep. Ascension (rafʿ) is mentioned in relation to Jesus , to whom God said, �O Jesus, I am gathering you and raising you to Me� [3:55]. Thus when a person dies, He [God] removes (yanziʿu) from him the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the luminous spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ al-nūrī) [separating it] from the subtle substance (laṭīf) of the dense natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ al-kathīf), and by this [luminous spiritual self] he comprehends things (yaʿqilu al-ashyāʾ), and is given the vision (rūʾyā) in the heavenly kingdom (malakūt). However, when a person sleeps, He extracts from him the subtle substance of the dense natural self, not the subtle substance of the luminous spiritual self. Therefore, when the sleeping person awakens, he recovers a subtle breath (nafas laṭīf) from the subtle substance of the spiritual self, for if this were to part from him, it would leave him without motion (ḥaraka), and lifeless (mayyit). Thus, the dense natural self has a subtle substance (laṭīfa) and likewise the spiritual self has a subtle substance (laṭīfa). The life of the subtle substance of the natural self is by virtue of the light of the subtle substance of the spiritual self (nūr laṭīf nafs al-rūḥ). The spiritual life of the subtle substance of the spiritual self (ḥayāt rūḥ laṭīf nafs al-rūḥ) is by virtue of remembrance [of God] (dhikr), just as He has said: rather they are living with their Lord, provided for [by Him] [3:169], that is, they are sustained by remembrance, due to what they attained through the subtle luminous self."

Do not despair of God�s mercy��He said:God, Exalted is He, has given his servants respite, out of His bounty, up to their last breath, and He says to them, �Do not despair of My mercy; even if you came back to Me in your last breath, I would receive you.�He said:This verse is the most far reaching in conveying the compassion (ishfāq) shown by God, Exalted is He, to His servants; because, in accordance with His knowledge, He does not deprive them of that which He bestows on others, rather He showers mercy upon them to the point that He admits them to the very essence of [His] generosity (ʿayn al-karam), by virtue of [His] eternal remembrance of them. It was related of the angel Gabriel  that he heard Abraham  pray, �O You who are Most Generous in pardoning!� Then Gabriel  said to him, �O Abraham! Do you know what the generosity of His pardon (ʿafw) [implies]?� He answered, �No, O Gabriel.� He continued, �It is that when He pardons a misdeed, He converts it into a good deed.� Then Sahl said:Witness this of me: it is part of my religion that I do not disown the sinners among the nation of Muḥammad , nor the wicked, the murderers, the adulterers or the thieves, for truly, the extent of the generosity, bounty, and beneficence that God, Exalted is He, shows, especially to the nation of Muḥammad , cannot be fathomed.His words:"
