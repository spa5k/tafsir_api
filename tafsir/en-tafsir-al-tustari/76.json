This is why He differentiated between that which is pure and purifying (ṭāhir wa ṭuhūr), [namely], the wines of Paradise, and the wines of this world in their impurity. The wines of this world are sullied and they sully the one who drinks them with sins (āthām), whereas the wines of Paradise are purifying and purify the one who drinks them from every blemish (danas), thereby making him acceptable for the Holy Assembly (majlis al-quds) and the GloriousSpectacle (mashhad al-ʿizz).[Once] while Sahl was performing the prayer of darkness (ʿatma), he recited God�s words, Exalted is He: Their Lord will give them a pure drink. Then he began moving his mouth as if he was suckingsomething. When he finished his prayer he was asked, �Did you drink during the prayer?� To which he answered:By God, if I had not experienced its taste when I recited it as if I was drinking it, I would not have acted so. His words, Exalted is He:"

He was asked, �What are the most important characteristic moral traits that we should have?�He replied:To show endurance (iḥtimāl) in the face of hardship (maʾūna), compassion (rifq) in every situation,and caution against inclining to one�s lower passion if one is elevated [in rank]. Among these qualities is the attainment of the intellect (iktisāb al-ʿaql).Then there are another three which are necessary: attaining gnosis (iktisāb al-maʿrifa), and putting one�s knowledge into practice (istiʿmāl al-ʿilm), clemency (ḥilm) and humility (tawāḍuʿ).Yet still there are a further three [characteristics] which are necessary to acquire, and which contain the precepts of worship (aḥkām al-taʿabbud), namely: serenity (sakīna), dignified bearing (waqār) and equity (inṣāf). He also said:The earth will not consume the body of anyone who keeps the following three qualities: refrainingfrom harming people, bearing the harm that comes from them and doing good to them."
