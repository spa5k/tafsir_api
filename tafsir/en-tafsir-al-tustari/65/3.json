By resorting to Him (rujūʿ ilayhi), [the servant] will find that God provides for him the means of acquitting himself of that which He has given him to do, without his circumventing it. [This He does by extending to him] His aid (maʿūna) and protection (ʿiṣma). Trust in God (tawakkul) is not admissible from anyone except those who are mindful of God, and mindfulness of God is not admissible except with trust in God. For God, Exalted is He, said: and He will provide for him whence he never expected.His words, Exalted is He:\ufffdAnd whoever puts his trust in God, He will suffice him\ufffdHe said:That is, whoever entrusts his affairs to his Lord, will truly find that God, Exalted is He, suffices him in all that is necessary for him in both abodes.

Wāṣil al-ʿAnbarī reported that he heard Sahl say:I entered the desert seventeen times without any provision (zād) in the way of food and drink, or a money bag, or a drinking vessel or a staff, and whenever I needed something to eat, I would find it ready prepared for me. On one occasion as I was approaching the desert, a man gave me two genuine dirhams, so I put them in my pocket and proceeded on my way. I had walked for a while but did not find anything so I became weak. I started to say to myself, \ufffdWhat have you done that has resulted in that which you are accustomed to being withheld from you?\ufffd Then I heard a voice from the air (min al-hawā) say, \ufffdCast out what is in your pocket and what is in the unseen will come to you\ufffd, upon which I remembered that I had those two dirhams in my pocket, so I took them out and threw them away. I had not walked for long before I saw before me two pieces of bread spread with honey between them, [as fresh] as if they had just that moment come out of the oven. So from then on I returned to my former state [of tawakkul].His words, Exalted is He:"
