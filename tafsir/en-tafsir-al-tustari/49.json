The meaning is: �Do not speak before he [the Prophet] speaks�. Then when he speaks, move forward towards him, hearkening and listening to him; �and fear God, regarding the neglect of His rights, and the loss of reverence for Him. Surely God hears what you say, and knows what you do.His words:"

      "text": "�Shun much suspicion�He said:That is, �Do not discredit anyone [by holding] a bad opinion (sūʾ al-ẓann) about them without [knowing] the truth (ḥaqīqa) [of the matter].� Indeed the Prophet  said: �The most untruthful of reports is that of opinion (ẓann).� Then Sahl said:Bad opinion comes from ignorance and pertains to the natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ). The most ignorant person is the one who estranges his heart [from God] without being aware of it. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, has said: And that suspicion of yours which you held about your Lord has ruined you, so you have become among the losers. [41:23] Certainly, the servant is deprived of blessed provision and prayer at night because of bad opinion.One night a man, one of [God�s] servants, slept through [and missed] his customary rite (wird) and felt regret over it. [He] was asked: �Do you feel regret about [missing] that which you are wont to perform?� He replied, �I do not feel regret because of that, but rather because of the sin through which I became deprived of that good [deed].�Sahl was asked, �What is the meaning of the Prophet�s words : �Be on your guard with people, [by holding a] bad opinion (sūʾ al-ẓann).�� He replied:The meaning of this is [that protection from people] is [gained by holding a] bad opinion of yourself, not of other people. In other words, accuse your own self for not treating them fairly in your dealings with them. His words:�and do not spy�He said:That is, �Do not search out the faults that God has covered for His servants, for you may well be afflicted by that [fault].It was related of Jesus  that he used to say, �Do not speak too much other than in remembranceof God, Mighty and Majestic is He, for your hearts will be hardened, and the heart that is hard is far from God. Do not regard the faults of people as if you were their masters, but look at your own works as if they were your slaves."

Faith (īmān) has nothing to do with affiliations (ansāb); rather affiliations are only a part of Islam. The Muslim is beloved of people but the believer is in no need (ghanī) of people. His words:"

However, in its inner meaning it refers to the spirit (rūḥ), intellect (ʿaql), heart (qalb), basic nature (ṭabʿ), desire (hawā) and lust (shahwa). If natural instinct, desire and lust take up arms against the heart, intellect and spirit, the servant must fight them with the swords of vigilance (murāqaba), the arrows of inspection (muṭālaʿa) and the lights of conformity (muwāfaqa), so that the spirit and the intellect gain the upper hand, and desire and lust are vanquished.His words:"
