Then it was passed down from prophet to prophet until it came to Shuʿayb. Subsequently, when [Shuʿayb] gave Moses his daughter in marriage, he presented the staff to him. Moses  used to lean on it, drive his sheep with it, scatter leaves for his sheep with it; then he would take from the tree whatever he wanted with it, and he would send it after lions, wild beasts and the vermin of the earth and it would strike them. If the heat became intense, he would stick it in the ground upright and it would provide shade. When he slept, it would guard over him until he awoke, and if the night was pitch dark, it would light up for him like a torch. When it was a cloudy day and he could not tell the time for prayer, it would give off rays from one of its sides. If he became hungry he would plant it in the earth and it would bear fruit immediately. These were the uses of his staff. Moses  mentioned the benefits and uses of the staff that had appeared to him, but God, Exalted is He, intended [to draw his attention to] uses and benefits [of the staff] that were, as yet, hidden from him, such as its turning into a snake, or [Moses�] striking the rock with it so that the springs gushed forth from it, or his striking the sea with it, and other such uses. It was through this that He showed him that the knowledge of people, even when they are supportedby prophecy (nubuwwa), is deficient when compared to God�s knowledge regarding the universe of created things.His words, Exalted is He:"

However, He did not will for him [Pharaoh] faith (īmān), for had He willed it, He would have said, �So he may believe.� Rather, God, Mighty and Majestic is He, intended by this [command] that Moses  should show graciousness (mulāṭafa) through the most beautiful discourse and gentlest speech, for this moves the hearts of all people, just as the Prophet  said, �Hearts have been created with the disposition to love those who are good to them and to hate those who do wrong to them.� This was to pre-empt his [Pharaoh�s] argument (ḥujja), and to awaken interest in those among the sorcerers and others whom God knew would be guided.His words, Exalted is He:"
