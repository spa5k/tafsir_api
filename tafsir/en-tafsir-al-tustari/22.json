You will see him striving for the cause of God�s religion and His obedience, upholding God�s oneness and the emulation of His Prophet , constantly making humble entreaty (taḍarruʿ) of God and seeking refuge in Him in the hope of connecting to Him through following [exemplaryguidance]. Zayd b. Aslam related from the Prophet  that he said: �Every person of my nation (umma) will enter Paradise, save the one who refuses.� We said, �O Messenger of God who will refuse that?� He said, �Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me has refused to enter Paradise.� His words, Exalted is He:�if good [fortune] befalls him, he is reassured by it�That is, whoever follows [his] desire, if his heart is satisfied and his lower self is happy in its worldly share, he will feel reassured by it. Otherwise he will return to the disbelief that his desire calls him to. His words:"

Therefore, just as God has commandedthe purification of His House [at Mecca] from idols, so also He has commanded the purification of that house of His in which He deposited the mystery of faith (sirr al-īmān) and the light of gnosis (nūr al-maʿrifa), namely, the heart of the believer. God, Exalted is He, has commanded the believer to purify himself from rancour (ghill), deceit (ghishsh), inclination towards the lusts of the lower self (shahawāt al-nafs) and heedlessness (ghafla). For those who circumambulate it [the Kaʿba], as also for those who uphold the lights of faith, there will be manifold increase in [God-given] success (tawfīq).�And those who bow and prostrate themselvesin fear and hope. Truly the heart ⸢is [like] a house⸣: if it is unoccupied it goes to ruin, and [likewise] if it is occupied by other than its owner, ⸢or by other than one whom the owner has settled there⸣, it will also go to ruin. Therefore, if you wish your hearts to be in good repair, do not let your prayer in them be other than to God, Exalted is He; ⸢if you want to keep your breasts (ṣuḍūr) in good repair, let not anything be in them other than [awareness of] the Hereafter⸣; if you want to preserve your tongues, do not let your prayer on them be other than truthfulness (ṣidq); and if you wish to preserve your bodily members, do not allow them to become engaged with anything other than what is in accordance with the Sunna.His words:"

Sālim said, �I was working on a piece of land to improve it, when I saw Sahl on a couch above the water of the Euphrates River.� He also said, �One day I entered Sahl�s house, the door of which was very small, and I saw a horse standing there. Then I left in fright, wondering how it could have entered through such a small door. Sahl saw me and told me to come back, so I returned and saw nothing there.� It has been related that ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb  was gazing down on the congregation at ʿArafāt and said, �If only the congregation in this plain knew [the hosts] who have descended, they would have rejoiced at His bounty (faḍl) after [receiving tidings of] being forgiven (maghfira)�.

How many people are drawing closer to You through sacrifice (qurbān) this night! I have also tried to draw closer to You through sacrifice,� that is to say, through prayers (ṣalawāt). �What will You make of it, O Beloved One?� It was related of ʿAdī b. Thābital-Anṣārī that he said, �The sacrifice of those who are mindful of God (muttaqūn) is prayer.� But God knows best.His words:"

Ḥasan said, �He called it Ancient (ʿatīq) to honour it, just as the Arabs speak of an �ancient� body, and an �ancient� horse if it is noble.� My maternal uncle, Muḥammad b. Sawwār, related on the authority of al-Thawrī that he said, �It is called this because it is the oldest (aqdam) and most ancient (aʿtaq) place of worship belonging to God, just as He said: The first House (of worship) to be established for people was that at Bakka, a blessed place [3:96].�Some have said, �He [God] called it ʿatīq because no tyrant ever headed for it with an evil design without God�s destroying him and freeing (aʿtaqa) His House from him. Some have said, �It is because it was saved (uʿtiqa) from being submerged during the great flood and raised to the sky.� Just as God has freed His House, so He has also freed the heart of the believer from other [than Him]. It [the Kaʿba] is older than anything else that God, Exalted is He, erected on His earth as a sign (ʿalam), and He placed it within the Sacred Mosque (al-Masjid al-Ḥarām). Likewise the heart has [within it] another heart, which is the position from which the servant stands before his Master without being agitated or busied by anything, but in a state of tranquil repose in Him (sākin ilayhi).His words, Exalted is He:"

However, if [the person reciting] then witnesses the One remembered (madhkūr) instead of the remembrance [itself] (dhikr), the heart will become oblivious of it [the recitation], and he will not witness anything besides his Master. Consequently Satan will become one of his captives. Do you not see how if a servant is inattentive (sahā) in his recitation (qirāʾa) or in his remembrance of his Lord, Mighty andMajestic is He, his heart acquiesces in the basest pleasures (huẓūẓ) of his lower self and thus can the Enemy [Satan] get at him. Ḥasan said, �The whispering (waswās) is of two kinds, one of which is from the lower self and the other from Satan. That which persists in coming is from the lower self, and assistance against it is sought through fasting, prayer and propriety (adab). However, that which [comes, but then] withdraws (nabdhan) is from Satan, and assistance against it is sought through the recitation of the Qurʾān and remembrance [of God] (dhikr).�His words:"

These are among the results of faith, for God, Exalted is He, has said: So that they may believe in it and their hearts may be humbled to Him. And God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
