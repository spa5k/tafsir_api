Ḥayyān that they met one day and Haram said to Uways, \ufffdMake a supplication to God [for me]\ufffd. So he prayed, \ufffdMay He make your intention (nīya) and your heart (qalb) sound, for there is nothing more seriously in need of curing than these two. For while your heart [seems to be] going towards [God] (muqbil), it may [in fact] be going away [from Him] (mudbir), and while your heart [seems to be] going away, [it may, in fact] be going towards [Him]. Do not consider the insignificance of a misdeed, but rather consider [the greatness of] the One whom you have disobeyed. If you deem it [the misdeed] as great, verily you have magnified God, Exalted is He, whereas if you belittle it, for sure you have belittled God, Exalted is He.\ufffdHis words, Exalted is He:"
