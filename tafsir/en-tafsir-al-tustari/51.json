I also came across people among whom a man would leave his brother responsible for his family for forty years. [Moreover,] the members of his household would suffer a supplicant even if they were neither of jinn nor of humankind. Those who came before you only took from this world what was absolutely necessary. They would sell their own selves for the sake of kindness [to others]. May God have mercy on the person who lives the simplest of lives, eating just a crust of bread, and wearing worn-out clothes, who is the lowliest of men, strives hard in his worship, cries over the misdeed he commits, flees from punishment and seeks God�s mercy up to the moment when death overtakes him, he being in that state.� It was related that a man came to the Prophet  and said, �O Messenger of God � may God make me your ransom! � what is the matter with me that I dislike death?� He said, �Do you have wealth?� He replied, �Yes.� So [the Prophet] said, �Then give away your wealth.� [The man] replied, �I am incapable of doing that, O Messenger of God.� [The Prophet said ], �Truly, aman�s heart is with his wealth, so if he gives his wealth away, it will want to go along with it, but if he holds on to it, it will want to remain with it.� His words, Exalted is He:"

Then He assembled you stage by stage. Do you not see this remarkable omnipotence (qudra), and hence believe in His unicity (waḥdāniyya) and His omnipotence (qudra)?Furthermore, God, Exalted is He, has created within the soul of the son of Adam one thousand and eighty portents, three hundred and sixty of which are apparent and three hundred and sixty of which are hidden, but which you could see if He unveiled them to you. The [remaining] three hundred and sixty of them are obscure and are only known to a prophet or veracious person (ṣiddīq). If just one of these [latter portents] were to be revealed to the possessors of intellects (ahl al-ʿuqūl), they would attain sincerity (ikhlāṣ).Truly God, Exalted is He, has veiled the hearts of those who are heedless (ghāfilūn) from His remembrance due to their pursuance of lusts, which [prevent them] from perceiving these portents.However, He has unveiled them to the hearts of those who have gnosis of Him (ʿārifūn), thereby causing them to attain it [sincerity].His words, Exalted is He:"
