The goodly loan [for which He asks] is the witnessing of Him (mushāhadat), just as the Prophet  said: �Worship God as if you see Him�� The following saying is narrated from Abū Ḥāzim: �Verily, [in this world] there is little market for the merchandise of the Hereafter, so ask and hope for more slow seasons [to increase your stock], for when the day for spending arrives, you will not be able to build it up either by a little or a lot.His words, Exalted is He:"

The one who conforms reveres him and his standing (shaʾn), and the one who opposes holds him in awe and fears him. This is the light which God made for His friends and it does not appear in anyone unless he has submitted and humbled himself to Him. It belongs to the light of faith. Then He described the hypocrites, in their saying to them [the believers]:"

The angels will reply to them, �Go back and seek light by means of the intellects (ʿuqūl) you used to manage your affairs in your life in the world.� They turn back to the rear, but then God places a wall between themselves and their own intellects, and He veils from them the right choice, so they do not reach the path of guidance. Then when they end up crossing the Traverse they fall into Hell, abiding there forever.His words, Exalted is He:"

Then on the last day of his life a man recited the verse before him, So on this day no ransom will be taken from you, and I saw him tremble and sway to the point where he almost fell down. When he recovered his state of sobriety (ṣaḥw), I asked him about what had passed, saying, �Nothing has happened like this during my time with you.� Hereplied, �Yes I know, my dear friend! Indeed I have become weak.� So I asked, �What is the condition [that denotes] a strong state (quwwat al-ḥāl)?� He replied, �There is no influx [from above] (wārid) that comes over him without his absorbing it through his strength. Whoever acts in this way will not be changed by the influxes [of grace] (wāridāt) that he receives, howeverstrong they may be.�He also used to say, �My state during [ritual] prayer (ṣalāt) is the same as that before the commencementof the prayer.� This is because he would keep watch over his heart and keep God, Exalted is He, before his eyes with his innermost secret (sirr) before commencing the prayer, and consequently he would stand for prayer with the presence of his heart (ḥuḍūr qalbihi) and the collectedness of his spiritual energy (jamʿ himmatihi).

Then it is the soul�s endurance (mukābadat al-nafs) in fulfilling the divine commandments, [in a state of] purity (ṭahāra) from every kind of defilement(adnās). This will bring about ease in worship, and thereafter he will abide in the stations of the worshippers. Then God will let him experience that which His friends (awliyāʾ) and elect (aṣfiyāʾ) experienced, which is the rank of tasting (madhāq). He [Abū Bakr al-Sijzī] said, �He [Sahl] then mentioned to us the following�:One day Abraham , Friend of the Lord of Mercy, was in the desert on an extremely hot day, and he was afflicted with great thirst. He saw an Abyssinian man tending some camels, so he asked: �Do you have any water?� He replied, �O Abraham, what do you prefer: water or milk?� He said: �Water.�He [Sahl] continued:He then struck a rock with his foot upon which water gushed forth. Abraham  was amazed, so God said to Abraham, through inspiration, �If that Abyssinian man had asked Me to remove the heavens and earth from existence I would have removed them.� So he [Abraham] asked, �Why is that, O Lord?� He replied, �It is because he does not desire anything from the world or the Hereafter except Me.� ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays said,I have found the world to comprise four main properties (khiṣāl). As for two of these, namely, the [desire for] women and the [desire] to amass wealth, my soul (nafs) has renounced them willingly. However, as for the other two, there is no doing without them, though I try to keep them away from me as much as I can; these are sleep and food. His words, Exalted is He:"

The significance (maʿnā) of the names (asmāʾ) is none other than gnosis (maʿrifa) of the One who is named (musammā), and the significance of worship (ʿibāda) is none other than gnosis of the One who is worshipped (maʿbūd). The meaning of the Manifest (al-Ẓāhir) is the One who is manifestin His exaltedness (ʿuluww), omnipotence (qudra) and coerciveness (qahr).
