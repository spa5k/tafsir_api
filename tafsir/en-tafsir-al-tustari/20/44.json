However, He did not will for him [Pharaoh] faith (īmān), for had He willed it, He would have said, \ufffdSo he may believe.\ufffd Rather, God, Mighty and Majestic is He, intended by this [command] that Moses  should show graciousness (mulāṭafa) through the most beautiful discourse and gentlest speech, for this moves the hearts of all people, just as the Prophet  said, \ufffdHearts have been created with the disposition to love those who are good to them and to hate those who do wrong to them.\ufffd This was to pre-empt his [Pharaoh\ufffds] argument (ḥujja), and to awaken interest in those among the sorcerers and others whom God knew would be guided.His words, Exalted is He:"
