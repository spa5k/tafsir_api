Your Lord is ever Watchful.He said:Verily, God, Exalted is He, has commanded steadfastness (ṣabr) in the face of that in which He has placed a test (fitna) for mankind. From this [steadfastness] comes a diminishing in one�s coveting (iṭrāq) what [other] people possess. Abū Ayyūb related concerning the Prophet  that a man came to him ⸢and said �Give me a sermon, in a few words⸣�, so he said, �When you stand for prayer, perform the prayer of one who is bidding farewell; do not say anything which you will be sorry for saying tomorrow; and resolve to give up hope of [attaining] that which other people possess.� Indeed our predecessors used to take full advantage of this [admonition], such that it is related of Ḥudhayfa that he said, �Truly, the most delightful day for me is the day on which I return home and my family complains to me of their need. This is because I heard the Messenger of God  say: �Verily God has kept the world from his believing servant, just as the family of a sick person keeps food and drink from him. Indeed, God promises the believer affliction (balāʾ) just as the father promises good things (khayr) for his son.��His words, Exalted is He:"

Would that I had not taken so and so as a friend!He said:The soundest friendship is that which does not lead to regret (nadāma), and that is nothing less than intimacy (uns) with God, Exalted is He, and seclusion from people. The Messenger of God  used to observe seclusion (khalwa) for the sake of the knowledge that God had opened to his heart, for he liked to reflect upon it.Everything will befriend the person whose prayer is good. Such a person will be stirred during sleep at the prayer times so that he awakes. This is done by his brothers among the jinn who have befriended him. They may also accompany him when he travels and give him priority over themselves. The angels may even befriend him. Once a man made a request from Sahl saying, �I really want to keep your company.� He said, �When one of us dies, let whomsoever keeps company with the one who survives, keep his company from then on.� Al-Rabīʿ b. Khaytham was sitting on his porch one day when a stone came flying at him and struck his forehead making a gash in it, upon which he said, �Truly, you have been admonished, O Ibn Khaytham!� Then he entered his home, shutting the door behind him and was not seen seated in that same position up to his death.

He said:Trust (tawakkul) was the state of being (ḥāl) of the Messenger of God  and earning was his Sunna. He only established the Sunna of earning for them due to their weakness, after they fell from the rank of trust (tawakkul), which was his state of being. However he did not demote them from the rank of seeking a living through earning, which is his Sunna. Furthermore, had it not been for that [the Sunna of earning] they would have perished. Sahl said:Whoever defames earning (kasb), has defamed the Sunna and whoever defames trust (tawakkul) has defamed faith. His words:"
