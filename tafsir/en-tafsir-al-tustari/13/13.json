Their speech is thunder and their laughter is lightning.\ufffd\ufffd Abū Bakr said that he asked him , \ufffdWhat would you say regarding a day on which there is a heavy downpour and the sound of the thunder is violent?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdThis is a report of God\ufffds good pleasure (riḍā), Mighty and Majestic is He, so how must be the report of His wrath (ghaḍab). Let us seek refuge in God from His wrath.\ufffdHis words, Exalted is He:"
