The angels do not know the good and evil that is within a person\ufffds conscience (ḍamīr) save when that person\ufffds heart acquiesces in it [either good or evil]. When there is a resolution [to do] something good, its effect will manifest a beautiful perfume within the breast (ṣadr) and thence from the breast to the bodilymembers; whereas when there is a resolution to do evil it manifests darkness and a rotten smell. In any event, God knows all of this from [the servant], so he should fear Him in accordance with His words, Surely God has been watchful over you [4:1].His words, Exalted is He:"
