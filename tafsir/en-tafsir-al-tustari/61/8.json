  "text": "They desire to extinguish the light of God with their mouths\ufffdThis means: with their tongues they denied the proof (ḥujja) of the Prophet  that appeared to them, and with their souls they turned away from it. But God bound (qayyada) some souls to accept him, namely, those whom He brought into existence under the decree of eternal bliss, and He adorned some hearts with the lights of His gnosis (maʿrifa), and the secrets of its light by virtue of firm belief (taṣdīq). So they spent freely of their whole being (muhaj) and their possessions for Him, like al-Ṣiddīq and al-Fārūq, and the other honourable Companions, y. His words, Exalted is He:"
