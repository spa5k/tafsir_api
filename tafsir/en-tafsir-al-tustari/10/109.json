Furthermore He directed them to the right guidance (rushd) for them with His words, And follow what is revealed to you, and be steadfast until God gives judgement, for He is the Best of Judges. To be steadfast in following [what is revealed], is to abandon devisingand self management (tadbīr), for in this [abandonment] there is now [i.e. in this world] deliverance from the vain caprices (ruʿūnāt) of the lower self, and later [i.e. in the next world] salvation from the shame of transgression.His words, Exalted is He:"
