Now when [until now] you have been hastening it on?That is, \ufffdYou hasten to deny Us and remember other than Us, but when you come before Us and behold with your eyes the punishment We had promised you, [only then] do you believe, when it is [no longer] of [any] benefit [to you].\ufffd For [indeed] all people [on that day] will inevitably affirm His oneness in the Hereafter, when the power of [His] essence (ḥukm al-dhāt) is made manifest, and all opposing and rival [deities that have been falsely set up] will be renounced, along with the [false] supplications made to them, due to the cessation of doubt and the fear of punishment.His words, Exalted is He:"
