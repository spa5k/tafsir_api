Do not despair of God\ufffds mercy\ufffd\ufffdHe said:God, Exalted is He, has given his servants respite, out of His bounty, up to their last breath, and He says to them, \ufffdDo not despair of My mercy; even if you came back to Me in your last breath, I would receive you.\ufffdHe said:This verse is the most far reaching in conveying the compassion (ishfāq) shown by God, Exalted is He, to His servants; because, in accordance with His knowledge, He does not deprive them of that which He bestows on others, rather He showers mercy upon them to the point that He admits them to the very essence of [His] generosity (ʿayn al-karam), by virtue of [His] eternal remembrance of them. It was related of the angel Gabriel  that he heard Abraham  pray, \ufffdO You who are Most Generous in pardoning!\ufffd Then Gabriel  said to him, \ufffdO Abraham! Do you know what the generosity of His pardon (ʿafw) [implies]?\ufffd He answered, \ufffdNo, O Gabriel.\ufffd He continued, \ufffdIt is that when He pardons a misdeed, He converts it into a good deed.\ufffd Then Sahl said:Witness this of me: it is part of my religion that I do not disown the sinners among the nation of Muḥammad , nor the wicked, the murderers, the adulterers or the thieves, for truly, the extent of the generosity, bounty, and beneficence that God, Exalted is He, shows, especially to the nation of Muḥammad , cannot be fathomed.His words:"
