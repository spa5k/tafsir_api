Ḥayyān that they met one day and Haram said to Uways, �Make a supplication to God [for me]�. So he prayed, �May He make your intention (nīya) and your heart (qalb) sound, for there is nothing more seriously in need of curing than these two. For while your heart [seems to be] going towards [God] (muqbil), it may [in fact] be going away [from Him] (mudbir), and while your heart [seems to be] going away, [it may, in fact] be going towards [Him]. Do not consider the insignificance of a misdeed, but rather consider [the greatness of] the One whom you have disobeyed. If you deem it [the misdeed] as great, verily you have magnified God, Exalted is He, whereas if you belittle it, for sure you have belittled God, Exalted is He.�His words, Exalted is He:"

It was then sent down to the spirit (rūḥ) of Muḥammad , which is the blessed spirit (rūḥ mubārak), and thus He called the Night of Great Merit a blessed night (layla mubāraka) due to the [spiritual] link between one [descent of] blessing and the other.
