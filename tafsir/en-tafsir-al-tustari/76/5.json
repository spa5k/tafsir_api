He was asked, \ufffdWhat are the most important characteristic moral traits that we should have?\ufffdHe replied:To show endurance (iḥtimāl) in the face of hardship (maʾūna), compassion (rifq) in every situation,and caution against inclining to one\ufffds lower passion if one is elevated [in rank]. Among these qualities is the attainment of the intellect (iktisāb al-ʿaql).Then there are another three which are necessary: attaining gnosis (iktisāb al-maʿrifa), and putting one\ufffds knowledge into practice (istiʿmāl al-ʿilm), clemency (ḥilm) and humility (tawāḍuʿ).Yet still there are a further three [characteristics] which are necessary to acquire, and which contain the precepts of worship (aḥkām al-taʿabbud), namely: serenity (sakīna), dignified bearing (waqār) and equity (inṣāf). He also said:The earth will not consume the body of anyone who keeps the following three qualities: refrainingfrom harming people, bearing the harm that comes from them and doing good to them."
