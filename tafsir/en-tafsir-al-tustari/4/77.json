All knowledgeis a testimony against [the one who possesses it], except for that which is acted upon. All action is futile except for that which is done with sincerity (ikhlāṣ), and sincerity is not achieved except through adherence to the Sunna.Then he said:Your world is your lower self (nafs). Thus, if you annihilate it, there will be no world for you. His words, Exalted is He:"
