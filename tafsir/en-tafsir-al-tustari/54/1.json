This was the first of the signs [of the approach] of the Hour. The following is related from Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī: \ufffdOnce I was with my father in town when the time for the Friday prayer came, so he took me by the hand and went with me to the Friday prayer. Then Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān rose to the pulpit, praised God and extolled Him, and said, \ufffdThe Hour has drawn near and the moon has split. Is not the Hour drawing nigh? Has the moon not been cleft asunder? Is this world not fading into decline? Is it not so, that the race track is set today and the race will be on the morrow?\ufffd When we went outside again I said, \ufffdO Father, will people race each other tomorrow?\ufffd He replied \ufffdO my son! It\ufffds clear you don\ufffdt realise [what he meant by] \ufffdThe race is on the morrow\ufffd. He is just saying that whoever works [righteousness] today will excel in the Hereafter.\ufffd\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
