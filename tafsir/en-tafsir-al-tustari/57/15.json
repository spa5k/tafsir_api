  "text": "So on this day no ransom will be taken from you\ufffdThat is, no ransom will be accepted for your souls.Ibn Sālim said:I served Sahl b. ʿAbd Allāh for sixty years and he did not change in terms of his practice of remembrance or anything else. Then on the last day of his life a man recited the verse before him, So on this day no ransom will be taken from you, and I saw him tremble and sway to the point where he almost fell down. When he recovered his state of sobriety (ṣaḥw), I asked him about what had passed, saying, \ufffdNothing has happened like this during my time with you.\ufffd Hereplied, \ufffdYes I know, my dear friend! Indeed I have become weak.\ufffd So I asked, \ufffdWhat is the condition [that denotes] a strong state (quwwat al-ḥāl)?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdThere is no influx [from above] (wārid) that comes over him without his absorbing it through his strength. Whoever acts in this way will not be changed by the influxes [of grace] (wāridāt) that he receives, howeverstrong they may be.\ufffdHe also used to say, \ufffdMy state during [ritual] prayer (ṣalāt) is the same as that before the commencementof the prayer.\ufffd This is because he would keep watch over his heart and keep God, Exalted is He, before his eyes with his innermost secret (sirr) before commencing the prayer, and consequently he would stand for prayer with the presence of his heart (ḥuḍūr qalbihi) and the collectedness of his spiritual energy (jamʿ himmatihi). His words, Exalted is He:"
