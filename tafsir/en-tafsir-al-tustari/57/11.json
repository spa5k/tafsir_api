The goodly loan [for which He asks] is the witnessing of Him (mushāhadat), just as the Prophet  said: \ufffdWorship God as if you see Him\ufffd\ufffd The following saying is narrated from Abū Ḥāzim: \ufffdVerily, [in this world] there is little market for the merchandise of the Hereafter, so ask and hope for more slow seasons [to increase your stock], for when the day for spending arrives, you will not be able to build it up either by a little or a lot.His words, Exalted is He:"
