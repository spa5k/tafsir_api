The angels will reply to them, \ufffdGo back and seek light by means of the intellects (ʿuqūl) you used to manage your affairs in your life in the world.\ufffd They turn back to the rear, but then God places a wall between themselves and their own intellects, and He veils from them the right choice, so they do not reach the path of guidance. Then when they end up crossing the Traverse they fall into Hell, abiding there forever.His words, Exalted is He:"
