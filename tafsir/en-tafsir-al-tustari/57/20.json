Then it is the soul\ufffds endurance (mukābadat al-nafs) in fulfilling the divine commandments, [in a state of] purity (ṭahāra) from every kind of defilement(adnās). This will bring about ease in worship, and thereafter he will abide in the stations of the worshippers. Then God will let him experience that which His friends (awliyāʾ) and elect (aṣfiyāʾ) experienced, which is the rank of tasting (madhāq). He [Abū Bakr al-Sijzī] said, \ufffdHe [Sahl] then mentioned to us the following\ufffd:One day Abraham , Friend of the Lord of Mercy, was in the desert on an extremely hot day, and he was afflicted with great thirst. He saw an Abyssinian man tending some camels, so he asked: \ufffdDo you have any water?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdO Abraham, what do you prefer: water or milk?\ufffd He said: \ufffdWater.\ufffdHe [Sahl] continued:He then struck a rock with his foot upon which water gushed forth. Abraham  was amazed, so God said to Abraham, through inspiration, \ufffdIf that Abyssinian man had asked Me to remove the heavens and earth from existence I would have removed them.\ufffd So he [Abraham] asked, \ufffdWhy is that, O Lord?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdIt is because he does not desire anything from the world or the Hereafter except Me.\ufffd ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays said,I have found the world to comprise four main properties (khiṣāl). As for two of these, namely, the [desire for] women and the [desire] to amass wealth, my soul (nafs) has renounced them willingly. However, as for the other two, there is no doing without them, though I try to keep them away from me as much as I can; these are sleep and food. His words, Exalted is He:"
