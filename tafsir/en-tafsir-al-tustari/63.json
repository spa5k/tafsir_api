This is why He named them hypocrites. Whoever knows [the truth] with his heart and affirms it with his tongue, yet without any excuse does not perform with his bodily members (bi-arkānihi) that which God has made compulsory for him, is like Iblīs, may God curse him, who knew it [the truth] and affirmed it, but did not act upon His commandments.He further said:Hypocrisy (nifāq) is of two kinds: [one is] a belief (ʿaqd) held in the heart which is contradicted outwardly on the tongue, just as He has said, Exalted is He: They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts [48:11]; the other is the hypocrisy of the natural self (nafs al-ṭabʿ) towards the person to whom it belongs, and this was referred to by the Prophet  when he said, �The hidden association [idolatry] (shirk) in my community is more hidden than the crawling of an ant across a boulder on a dark night.� His words, Exalted is He:"

      "text": "O you who believe, do not let your wealth and your children distract you�from performing your religious duties on time. For whoever is distracted from the remembranceof God or His service (khidma) by some phenomenon, or something for the sake of his lust (shayʾan li-shahwatihi), [if then] he experiences [thereby] exultation (nashāṭ) in his devotions, he is deluded (makhdūʿ),ʿsave in [those religious duties] which God, Mighty and Majestic is He, accepts.It has been related that once [when he was ailing] Salmān was visited by Saʿd b. Abī Waqqāṣ. Salmān wept, so Saʿd asked him, �What could be making you weep, O Abū ʿAbd Allāh, when our Master the Messenger of God  was content with you when he died, and you will meet your companions again and will drink from his pool?� Salmān said, �I do not weep out of fear of death or because of an avid attachment to the world, but rather because the Messenger of God  enjoined on us a commitment and said: �Let the provision that one of you takes from this world be like the victuals a rider [traveller] (rākib) takes [for his journey].� I have all these cushions around me, but all the Prophet  had around him was his blanket, his washing vesseland a bowl for food.� Saʿd said: �O Abū ʿAbd Allāh! Enjoin on us a pledge to which we cancommit ourselves after you have gone.� He said: �O Saʿd! Remember God, Exalted is He, when you have a concern that worries you, when you are making a judgement and when you are about to make an oath.� But God, Exalted is He, knows best what is correct.His words, Exalted is He:"
