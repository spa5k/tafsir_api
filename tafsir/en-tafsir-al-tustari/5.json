Our knowledge is only of what they outwardly affirmed on their tongues. �You, only You are the Knower of things unseen.�[Sahl] was asked, �Will He ask them about what was really in the hearts of [their] communities?� He replied:No, He only directed the question to them concerning their outward reality, which is in fact only an expression of their inner reality. They [the prophets] responded by indicating that [only He] possesses knowledge [of the answer]. It could also mean, �We have no knowledge of the meaning of your question, since You already have knowledge of our reply � You, only You, are the Knower of things unseen.�ḥHis words:"

This is because Your secret is between You and it [my innermost secret], and no one can have knowledge of it besides You.� It [that divine deposit] is the eye through which [the servant] sees God, the ear by which he hears God, and the tongue by which he calls Him. The evidence for it is in His words, Exalted is He, concerning the hypocrites, Deaf, dumb and blind [2:18]. This is because they do not have these deposits. But God knows best.He was asked about the words:"

Furthermore, each punishment constitutes a kind of purification, except the punishment of the heart, which is hardness. [Concerning] His words, Exalted is He:"

Furthermore, if you had turned to the Provider (al-Razzāq), your provision would have been taken care of. Then he said:You are not greater than ʿAmr b. Layth, who would march with one thousand horsemen and one thousand foot soldiers in his charge, each one holding a mace of gold and silver. Eventually it came to pass that he was imprisoned in a house after being handed over to the Caliph, who subsequently deprived him of food and drink. When his door was opened they found him dead with his mouth full of straw and clay due to his intense hunger. Then he [the Caliph] said, �Truly I have advised you and truly I am among those who give you good counsel.�It was related by Mālik b. Dīnār, from Ḥammād b. Salma and Ḥammād b. Yazīd, that these two came to visit Rābiʿa, and mentioned something concerning the matters of this world. So Rābi�a said, �You are talking about this world a lot. I think you must be hungry, so if you are hungrygo over to that pot with the flour and make yourselves whatever takes your fancy.� Then, one of those who were with her remarked, �If only we had some garlic.� Ḥammād continued, �Then I saw Rābiʿa�s lips moving and she had not even finished before a bird came with a clove of garlic in its beak which it cast down and then flew off.

They came to the Prophet , and the Qurʾān was recited for them. They were deeply moved by it so that their eyes overflowed [with tears], and they were not haughty, due to God�s protecting them from pride. Subsequently, they entered His religion because of the knowledge of God which He had deposited within them.Then he said:The corruption of religion is in three things: when kings commit excess[es] and [follow] their lusts; when the scholars issue rulings based on concessions; and when the Qurʾān reciters worshipwithout knowledge. Truly, people need the learned (ʿulamāʾ) for their life in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, it was related by Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh  from the Prophet  that he said: �The people of Paradise need the learned just as much as the people need them in this world. They visit their Lord every Friday and it is said to them: �Desire anything you want�, after which they head for the scholars, who tell them, �Desire such and such a thing�, so they desire that thing.� His words:"
