Guarding him by God�s command�, that is, [preserving] all the good and evil things that He has determined for His servant. Furthermore, they bear witness for [the servant] with fidelity (wafāʾ), and against him with severity (jafāʾ) on the Day of Resurrection.His words, Exalted is He:"

As for the lightning, it is a whip of light by which the angel drives the clouds.� Mujāhid also said this. It is reported that ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib  said: �Lightning is that with which the angels drive [the clouds] (makhārīq), and thunder is the voice of an angel.� Qatāda said: �Thunder is the sound of the clouds.�His words, Exalted is He:"

Their speech is thunder and their laughter is lightning.�� Abū Bakr said that he asked him , �What would you say regarding a day on which there is a heavy downpour and the sound of the thunder is violent?� He replied, �This is a report of God�s good pleasure (riḍā), Mighty and Majestic is He, so how must be the report of His wrath (ghaḍab). Let us seek refuge in God from His wrath.�His words, Exalted is He:"

He [Sahl] was asked, �And how is that?� He replied:If a servant is maintaining [true] obedience to God, he will be in a state of remembrance (dhākir), but when something occurs to his mind, he will be in a state of severance (qāṭiʿ) [from God]. If he is involved in an act [motivated by] his lower self, and something comes to his heart which guides him to remembrance and obedience, this is the role played by the intellect (mawḍiʿ al-ʿaql).Then he said:Anyone who claims to practise remembrance falls into one of two types. There are those whom the fear of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, never leaves, but who also experience love (ḥubb) and fervour (nashāṭ) in their hearts. They are truly people of remembrance and they live for God, the Hereafter, knowledge and the Sunna. Then there are those who claim to be in a state of fervour, joy and happiness in every situation. They are living for the enemy, this world, ignorance, and innovation and they are the worst of people.His words, Exalted is He:"

Action is noble, but sincerity in action is nobler still. Sincerity (ikhlāṣ) is noble, but witnessing (mushāhada) in [the state of] sincerity is nobler.
