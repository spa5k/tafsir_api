One of them is the Garden itself, and the other is life with Life itself (ḥayāt bi-ḥayāt) and permanent subsistence with Permanent Subsistence itself. Similarly it has been related in a report that the angels say to those solely devoted to Him (munfaridūn) on the Day of Resurrection, \ufffdProceed to your resting places in Paradise\ufffd, to which they say, \ufffdWhat is Paradise to us when we have devoted ourselves solely to [Him] because of a special understanding (maʿnā) which has been [granted] to us from Him? We do not want anything save Him \ufffd that is the only good life (ḥayāt ṭayyiba).\ufffd And God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
