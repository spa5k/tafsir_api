  "text": "Guide us to the straight path. He [Sahl] was asked, \ufffdHas not God already guided us to the straight path?\ufffd He replied:That is so, but this refers to seeking more from Him, as He has said: and with Us there is yet more [50:35]. [Thus] what is meant by His words Guide us is: \ufffdSupport us with Your aid (maʿūna) and empowerment (tamkīn)\ufffd.On another occasion he said that Guide us (ihdinā) means:Guide us (arshidnā) to the religion of Islam, which is the way to You, through assistance from You, which is insight (baṣīra), for we cannot be guided except through You, just as he [Moses] said: \ufffdPerhaps my Lord will show me the right way\ufffd [28:22], that is, \ufffdGuide me to pursue the path that leads to Him\ufffd.I heard Sahl relate on the authority of Muḥammad b. Sawwār from Sufyān, who heard it from Salīm, who was told by Abū al-Jaʿd from Thawbān, who narrated that the Messenger of God  said:God says: \ufffdI have divided the prayer between Me and My servant into two halves. Half of it is for Me and the other half is for My servant, and My servant gets what he asks for.\ufffd Thus, when the servant says, Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, God, Exalted is He, says, \ufffdMy servant has praised and thanked Me.\ufffd When he says, the Merciful, the Compassionate, [God says], \ufffdMy servant has extolled Me\ufffd. And when he says, Master of the Day of Judgement, [God says], \ufffdMy servant has glorified Me. These verses are for Me and for My servant is what he asks for [in the verses that come] after, as when he says, You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help.! Guide us to the straight path, until the end of the sūra.\ufffd God, Mighty and Majestic is He, says: \ufffdThese verses are for My servant and My servant shall receive what he asks for.\ufffd Sahl said:The meaning of \ufffdMy servant has glorified Me\ufffd here is: \ufffdHe has attributed abundant beneficence (iḥsān) and munificence (inʿām) to Me\ufffd.Sahl related on the authority of Mujāhid:Āmīn is one of the names of God, Exalted is He. Ibn ʿAbbās y said, \ufffdThe Christians have never envied you anything as much as your saying Āmīn."
