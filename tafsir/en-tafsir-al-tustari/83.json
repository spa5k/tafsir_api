Thus did Salmān [al-Fārisī]  say, �The prayer is the balance (mikyāl); whoever deals faithfully will be rewarded his due, but as for whoever stints � you already know what God, Exalted is He, has said concerning the defrauders (muṭaffifūn): Will you bid others to piety and forget yourselves...? [2:44]. You vilify them for the slips they make that are typical of the faults of men, and yet you commit similar misdeeds and those which are more abominable still.� No one looks upon the slips of [other] people except an ignorant wrongdoer, and no one [may] make known that which he has looked upon [of the faults of others] except God. Indeed it has been related that God spoke to David  through inspiration the words, �I complain of My servants to you, O David!� He asked, �And why is that, my Lord?� He replied, �It is because they sin in secret and repent in public, and truly I do not wish anyone to look upon the sin of my servant besides Me.�ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said that he had asked Sahl about God�s words, Nay, on that day they will be veiled from their Lord [83:15]. He replied:In this life they are veiled from the Commander (al-Āmir) and the Restrainer (al-Zājir). Thus it was related in a report, �Happy is the one whose heart acts for him as an admonisher and whose intellect as a restrainer.� So if a person wants something from which God is absent, they [the heart and intellect] will hold him back from it. � [But as for those mentioned in the verse], in the Hereafter they are veiled from the [divine] mercy, and from being able to behold God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and are deprived of His looking upon them with His good pleasure (riḍā) and satisfaction (riḍwān) when He questions them. Just as He has said, But [first] stop them, for they must be questioned [37:24] about [their] religion (diyāna), and they will not be able to shake off the evidence against them, so He will put them into the Hellfire."

He said:The record in its outward meaning in both of the two verses [18 and 19] is a reference to the [record of] deeds, the good and the evil. In its inner meaning it refers to the spirits of the believers and the spirits of the disbelievers. The spirits of the believers are gathered at the lote tree beyond which none may pass, in the form of green birds which fly freely in Paradise until the Day of Resurrection, stamped (marqūm) with [seal] of [God�s] good pleasure (riḍā) and satisfaction (riḍwān). On the other hand the spirits of the disbelievers are gathered at Sijjīn beneath the lowest earth, under the cheek of Satan, may God curse him, branded with hostility (ʿadāwa) and wrath (ghaḍab).
