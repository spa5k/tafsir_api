  "text": "Assuredly We purified them with a pure [thought]: the remembrance of the Abode. He said:He purified Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac from the remembrance (dhikr) of this world through a remembrance of Him, purely for [His sake] (khāliṣatan), not for the attainment of recompense(jazāʾ). Neither did they witness themselves in it [their remembrance]; rather, they remembered Him through Him and for Him. Furthermore, the one who remembers God through God (bi\ufffdLlāh) is not like the one who remembers God through the remembrance of God (bi-dhikri\ufffdLlāh). But God, Glorified and Exalted is He, knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
