  "text": "Surely those who are in awe of their Lord are apprehensive,He said: Fear (khashiya) is broken-heartedness (inkisār al-qalb) which comes from constantly standing (intiṣāb) before Him. After this level comes fearful apprehension (ishfāq), which is a milder (araqq) state than fear and more subtle (alṭaf). Fear is milder than dread (khawf) and dread is milder than terror (rahba), but for each one there is a particular characteristic and a place.His words:"
