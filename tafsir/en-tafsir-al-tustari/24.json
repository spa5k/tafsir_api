[His hallmark is also that he] eats little and weeps much; he seeks My forgiveness before dawn, and detests the licentious (fujjār) for My sake.��His words:"

It is related from ʿUbāda b. Ṣāmit that the Prophet  said, �If you can safeguard six things, I will guarantee for you entry into Paradise: be truthful when you speak; fulfil whatever you promise; carry out what has been entrusted to you [to do]; keep your chastity; lower your gaze; and refrain from doing harm to anyone.� It is reported that Ibn ʿUmar y was asked, �Did the Messenger of God ever look around during the prayer?� He answered, �Not even outside the prayer [did he look around].�His words:"

The likeness of his light means the likeness of the light of Muḥammad . Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, �He intended by this the heart of the believer and the luminescence (ḍiyāʾ) of professing the divine oneness (tawḥīd), for the hearts of the prophets Â are far too brilliant in their light to be described in terms of the likeness of these lights. He said, �The similitude of the light of the Qurʾān is a lamp (miṣbāḥ), a lamp whose candle (sirāj) is gnosis (maʿrifa), whose wick (fatīl) is the religious obligations (farāʾiḍ), whose oil (duhn) is sincerity (ikhlāṣ) and whose light (nūr) is the light of [spiritual] attainment (ittiṣāl). Whenever the sincerity increases in purity, the lamp increases in brightness(ḍiyāʾ); and whenever the religious obligations increase in [inner] realisation (ḥaqīqa), the lamp increases in light (nūr).His words:"

The believer is the one who fears that Day. Accordingto a saying related from Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī], someone mentioned in his presence, �There is a man who will leave the Hellfire after a thousand years�, to which Ḥasan responded, �If only I were him.� It was related from ʿAwn b. ʿAbd Allāh that he said, �Luqmān counselled his son, saying: �Have hope in God without feeling secure from His ruse (makr) and fear God without despairing of His mercy.� He responded [by asking], �How can I do that when I only have one heart?� He replied: �O my son, the believer has two hearts, one with which he carries hope in God and the other with which he fears Him.�� And God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
