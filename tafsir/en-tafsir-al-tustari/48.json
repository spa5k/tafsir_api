This is in their saying to the Messenger  at the time of the pledge (bayʿa), �We have pledged to you that we will not flee, and we will fight for you.� There is another possible meaning of the Hand of God is above their hands, which is, the grace (minna) of God is above them in their being guided to take the pledge, and His reward (thawāb) for them is above their pledge and their obedience for you.His words:"

      "text": "�And were it not for [some of] the believing men and believing women whom you did not know � lest you should trample them� He said:The real believer (al-muʾmin ʿalā�l-ḥaqīqa) is the one who is not heedless of his lower self and his heart, but scrutinises his states (aḥwāl), and keeps a close watch over his moments (awqāt). He observes his increase (ziyāda) [in a good state, distinguishing it] from his decline (nuqṣān), and shows gratitude on seeing an increase, but when there is a decline, devotes himself [to remedying it] and makes supplication.It is through these [real believers] that God repels calamity (balāʾ) from the inhabitants of earth. The [true] believer is never lax (mutahāwin) with the slightest shortcoming, for laxity with a little will inevitably lead to [laxity in] a lot.He further said:The servant will not get the taste of faith until he abandons six vices [lit. character traits, khiṣāl]: he should abandon what is forbidden (ḥarām), illegal possessions (suḥut), what is dubious (shubha), ignorance (jahl), intoxicant[s] (muskir) and ostentation (riyāʾ); [on the other hand] he should adhere to [six virtues]: knowledge (ʿilm), putting his actions right (taṣḥīḥ al-ʿamal), integrity of heart (naṣḥ bi�l-qalb), veracity of the tongue (ṣidq bi�l-lisān), correct conduct (ṣalāḥ) in associating with people and sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the way he deals with his Lord.He also said:The Book of God is founded upon five [virtues]: veracity (ṣidq), seeking the best [through God�s guidance] (istikhāra), consultation (istishāra), patience (ṣabr) and gratitude (shukr).His words:"

Indeed, the likeness of these [latter] is that of a passenger on board a ship at sea. He does not know whether he will be saved from [the sea] or drown in it. Those for whom this was true were the Companions of the Messenger of God  according to His words: and made binding on them the promise to be mindful of Him.His words:"

If God makes an exception [by saying �God willing�] while having full knowledge [of what is to happen], then it is not for one of his servants, who is deficient in knowledge, to determine upon something without making the exception of �God willing�.

For God first of all discloses to His servants gnosis (maʿārif), then forms of mediation (wasāʾil), then the spirit of peace (sakīna), and lastly intuitive insights (baṣāʾir). And one to whom God discloses intuitive insights, knows things according to their essences (jawāhir), as did Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq  who never erred in speech.His words:And to God belong the forces of the heavens and the earth�He said:His forces (junūd) are of different kinds: His forces in heaven are the prophets (anbiyāʾ), and on earth, [His] friends (awliyāʾ). His forces in heaven are hearts (qulūb), and on the earth, souls (nufūs). Whatever God empowers (sallaṭa) over you, [may be counted as being] among His forces. If He empowers your lower self over you, your lower self will itself destroy you; and likewise, if He empowers your bodily members over you, they themselves will destroy you. If your lower self overpowers your heart, it will drive you to the pursuit of desire (hawā). But if your heart overpowers your lower self and your bodily members, it will tether them with propriety (adab), compel them into worship (ʿibāda), and then adorn them with sincerity in servanthood (ikhlāṣ fi�l-ʿubūdiyya). All of these together amount to God�s forces.His words:"
