      "text": "O you who believe! Turn to God in sincere repentance�He said:Sincere repentance (tawba naṣūḥ) means that a person does not return [to sin], for he has become one of the company of lovers (aḥibba), and the lover does not embark upon anything which the Beloved dislikes.And he said:The mark of the one who is [truly] repentant (tāʾib) is that there is not a place on earth, nor a place under the sky, where he is not solely attached to the Throne and to the Owner of the Throne till the time when he leaves this world. In these times, I do not know of anyone not requiring repentance, for the Angel of Death will not visit any one of us without his saying [to the angel], �Just allow me to do such-and-such a thing. Just let me do so-and-so. Let me breathe for just an hour more.� Then he said:As for the one who is sincerely repentant (tāʾib mukhliṣ), even though it might be for only an hour, or even for one breath before his death, it will be said [to him], �How quickly you have come forth with true [sincere repentance] (ṣaḥīḥan)! [Accordingly] we have come to you in the manner that you have come.�His words:�on a day when God will not let the Prophet down�He said:He will not let him down concerning his nation, and will not refuse his intercession. Indeed God, Exalted is He, addressed the Prophet  through inspiration saying, �If you so wish I can place the affairs of your nation (amr ummatik) in your charge.� He replied, �O my Lord, You are better for them than me.� So God, Exalted is He, said, �Then I will not let you down concerning them.� His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:�They will say, �Our Lord! Perfect our light for us��He said:The state of utter neediness (iftiqār) does not leave the believers, either in this life or the next. When they are in Paradise they are in greater need for Him even though they are in the abode of honour, security and richness, because of their yearning for the encounter (liqāʾ) with Him. They say: �Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and grant us an encounter with You.� This is because He is the Illuminator of [all] lights (munawwir al-anwār), and He is the Goal of every seeker.His words, Exalted is He:"
