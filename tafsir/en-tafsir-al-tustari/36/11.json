The one who worships God with a truthful tongue, will find his heart ascends to the very Throne. The one who worships God with equity (inṣāf), will have the heavens and the earth weigh [in his favour]. He was asked, \ufffdWhat is equity (inṣāf) [in worship]?\ufffd He replied:It is that none of your bodily members moves unless it be for God. Furthermore, when you ask Him for the next day\ufffds provision (rizq), your equity has left you, for the heart cannot bear two concerns (hammān). Equity between you and other people is when you take from them with the attitude that you are receiving a favour. However, if you demand to be treated justly, that means you are not being equitable. It was related of John the Baptist and Jesus  that they went out walking, and John bumped into a woman, upon which Jesus said to him, \ufffdO son of my maternal aunt! Today you have committed a grave sin for which I do not think God will forgive you.\ufffd He responded, \ufffdAnd what is that?\ufffd He said, \ufffdYou bumped into a woman.\ufffd He said, \ufffdBy God, I did not notice her.\ufffd Jesus said \ufffdGlory be to God! Your body is with me but where is your heart?\ufffd He said, \ufffdIt is attached to the Throne, and if my heart were to find rest with the angel Gabriel  for just a blinking of the eye, I would consider myself as not having known God, Mighty and Majestic is He.\ufffdHis words:"
