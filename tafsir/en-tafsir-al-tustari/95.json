Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī]  said, �Short-sighted is the person who has had the world kept from him, yet does not realise that this is [a manifestation] of God�s regard for him. Moreover, short-sighted indeed is also the person who has had the world placed at his disposal, and does not fear that this may be a form of ruse (makr) that God is devising against him.� Then [Tustarī] said:By God, the world has not been made available to a servant without him transgressing as a consequence, no matter who they happened to be. Then he recited His words, Exalted is He, Nay, but man verily is wont to transgress the bounds! when he sees himself as self-sufficient.His words, Exalted is He:"
