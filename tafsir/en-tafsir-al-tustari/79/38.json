O God, I have transferred to him the reward [which You have granted] me concerning him.\ufffd The second sign is that the happiness of this world becomes insignificant in his eyes, even though it gives him ease. The third sign is that there is nothing closer to him than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, as [is indicated by] the saying of ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays, \ufffdI never regarded anything without seeing God as closer to it than myself.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
