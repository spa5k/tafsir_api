If these letters are read separately, Alif stands for God�s assembling [things in their creation] (taʾlīf), Mighty and Majestic is He, for He brought together all things as He willed. The Lām stands for His pre-eternal grace (luṭfuhu al-qadīm) and the Mīm stands for His great glory (majduhu al-ʿaẓīm).Sahl said:Each book that God, Exalted is He, sent down contains a secret, and the secret of the Qurʾān is contained within the letters which open the sūras, because they are names and attributes, such as when He says Alif Lām Mīm [2:1; 3:1; 29:1 and 31:1], Ṣād [38:1], Alif Lām Rā [10:1; 11:1; 13:1; 14:1 and 15:1], Kāf Ḥā Yā ʿAyn Ṣād [19:1], Tā Sīn Mīm [26:1 and 28:1], Ḥā Mīm [41:1], ʿAyn Sīn Qāf. When these letters are brought together they make up the Greatest Name of God � that is, if a letter is taken from each [group] of the opening letters of the sūras, one after the other in the order that the sūras were revealed, that is, Alif Lām Rā, Ḥā Mīm, and Nūn, they form the divine name al-Raḥmān.� Ibn ʿAbbās and Ḍaḥḥāk, on the other hand, said that Alif Lām Mīm means �I am God and I know�; while ʿAlī  said that these are names [in the form of] �disconnected� [letters], but if a letter is taken from each of the opening groups of letters, on the condition that it is not the same as the letter adjacent to it, and then they are assembled, they form one of the names of the Merciful. If this name is known and used in supplication, it will be the mightiest name by which the prayer of the supplicant who uses it will be answered.Sahl said:In the words Alif Lām Mīm,! That Book [2:1�2], Alif stands for God (Allāh), Lām stands for the servant (ʿabd), and Mīm stands for Muḥammad ."

The Prophet  said, �May God bless the family of Abū Awfāʾ, when they brought him charitable donations, by which he meant �[May God] have mercy on them.� He also said:Muḥammad b. Sawwār told us on the authority of Abū ʿAmr b. ʿAlāʾ that he said: �Ṣalāt� has three meanings, one of which is the prescribed prayer with its bowings and prostrations, which is referred to when God says: So pray to Your Lord and sacrifice [108:2], that is, grasp your left arm with your right hand in prayer, in self-abasement and in awe before God, Exalted is He. Thisis also reported from ʿAlī . The second meaning is to show mercy (taraḥḥum) [as discussed above], and the third meaning is supplication (duʿāʾ), as [for example] in the prayer over the dead. Indeed, the Prophet  said: �If any of you are invited for a meal, you should [accept the invitation]. But if [the one invited] is fasting he should pray�, that is, he should make a supplicationfor them to be endowed with blessing. Furthermore, the Prophet  said in a ḥadīth, ��and may the angels pray over you�, meaning pray for mercy to be bestowed upon you. In this [same] ḥadīth the Prophet  went on to say, �And if someone eats at his house, the angels pray over him [the host] until eventide�, meaning the angels supplicate for him. Sahl continued:Ṣalāt carries two meanings: one is the seeking of forgiveness (istighfār), and the other is forgiveness itself (maghfira). As for the meaning of �seeking forgiveness�, it is referred to in His words, And pray for them [9:103], that is, ask forgiveness for them; [and in His words], to [secure] the prayers of the Messenger [9:99], meaning asking for the Messenger�s supplication for forgiveness."

      "text": "(Yet there are people who take to themselves idols), loving them as if loving God; but those who believe love God more ardently�He said:It means that they love idols (andād) in the way that they love God, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, described the intensity of their disbelief and their constancy (ṣidq) in the state of disbelief as ignorance (jahl). He then described the love of the believers and their constancy in the state of faith in God, as truth (ḥaqq). Then He accorded superiority to the believers due to their knowledge [or gnosis, maʿrifa], saying, those who believe love God more ardently. This is due to their knowledge (maʿrifa), and all the other things that cause the believing servant to advance towards God and establish His remembrance. This is the level ofthe loving mystics (ʿārifūn muḥibbūn), since love is the inclination (ʿaṭf) for the purest reality (khāliṣat al-ḥaqq), which God, Exalted is He, [produces] in them.He was asked, �What is the sign of love?� He replied:It is the embracing of obedience and the relinquishing of [any sense] of need [for other than God] (mubāyanat al-fāqa). It has been related that God, Exalted is He, said in a revelation to Moses, �Do you know why I cast my love upon you?�, to which he replied, �No, O Lord.� He said, �Because you sought My delight (masarra). O Moses, [always] keep Me in mind, and don�t forget Me in any situation. Let your aspiration (himma) be for My remembrance (dhikr), for I will take care of your path.� But God, Transcendent and Exalted is He, knows best."

[Continuing on from this] Sahl explained that the words, If he is able to make his way there [3:97] are an allusion to the provision (zād) and the riding beast (rāḥila). He then asked, �Do you know what the provision and riding beast are?� They replied: �No�. So he said, �The provision is remembrance (dhikr) and the riding beast is patience (ṣabr).� Then he went on to relate how a man had accompanied him on the road to Mecca, and for two days had not found anything [to eat], so he said, �O teacher! I need sustenance!� to which he [Sahl] replied, �Sustenance is God.� The other man then said, �One cannot do without sustenance for the body to function.� To which he replied, �All bodies exist [only] through God, Mighty and Majestic is He.� Then he recited the following lines [in the basīṭ metre]:O Beloved, replenish [my longing]! May the water of longing pour down upon you from the rain cloud,Whose pouring increases my sorrows and anguish.An anguish remains in my heart, consuming me,Truly as love increases, with it will increase my rapture. After that, he said, �It is the world that severs those who are devoted to God from God, Mighty and Majestic is He.� Finally, he said, �The livelihood (ʿaysh) of angels is in obedience (ṭāʿa); the livelihood of the prophets is in knowledge (ʿilm) and waiting for relief (intiẓār al-faraj); and the livelihood of the veracious (ṣiddīqūn) is in emulation (iqtidāʾ).

The commandand prohibition are from Him; protection and the granting of success are from Him; and reward and punishment are from Him. However, actions are attributed (manṣūba) to the children of Adam, so whoever performs a good action must express gratitude to merit thereby an increase [in goodness]; and whoever performs a wicked act must seek forgiveness, so that he thereby merits forgiveness. Affliction from God is of two kinds: an affliction of mercy and an affliction of punishment. An affliction of mercy leads the afflicted person to show his utter need (iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and leads him to the abandonment of devising(tadbīr). However, an affliction of punishment leads the afflicted person [to rely] on his own choice (ikhtiyār) and devising.Sahl was then asked, �Which is more difficult, patience (ṣabr) in [a state of] well-being or patience during adversity?� He replied:Asking for safety (salāma) in times of security is more difficult than asking for safety in [a state of] fear.[On the same subject] Sahl said regarding His words, And if anyone believes in God, [God] guides his heart [aright] [64:11], �[Whoever] believes in God and that his affliction comes from God, will find his heart guided by God to the expectation of relief (intiẓār al-faraj) from Him�.His words:[5:2] �Help one another to righteousness and mindfulness of God�That is, to the performance of the obligatory acts, for righteousness (birr) is faith (īmān), and the performance of obligatory acts is a branch (farʿ) of faith."

In this regard, He also said: Yet if they repent, establish prayer, and pay the obligatory alms, then they are your brothers in religion [9:11] [and comrades].

He replied:It is singled out due to a particular characteristic it possesses, even though it is not apart from the obligatory prayers as a whole, in the same way that Gabriel and others were singled out for mention among the host of the angels, due to a certain particularity.He continued:There is another reason, namely, that the times of the rest of the prayers are known by both the knowledgeable and the ignorant, because their signs are obvious. However, the time for the ʿAṣr prayer is less clear. Thus by mentioning [this prayer] in particular, He urged people to take care to observe it at its correct time.His words [that follow in the same verse]:�And stand before God in submissionThat is, �Stand before God in prayer in a state of obedience, for many a worshipper is disobedient,such as the hypocrite and his like. The Prophet  was asked, �Which prayer is the best?� He replied, �The longest in devotion (qunūt), that is, the prayer [for which] one stands the longest (ṭūl al-qiyām). And Zayd b. Arqam  said that being devout (qunūt) is silence, for we used to speak during the prayer until God, Exalted is He, sent down the words, And stand before God in submission [2:238], after which we desisted from speaking [during prayer]. Muḥammad b. Sawwār said, �The qunūt is the witr, which was called a (qunūt) because of the supplication (duʿāʾ) which is offered in it whilst standing, aside from the recitation of Qurʾān.� This is a kind of magnifying (taʿẓīm) [of God] through supplication."

Show me how You give life to the dead��[Sahl] was asked whether or not Abraham was in doubt concerning his faith, and was therefore asking his Lord to show him a sign or miracle in order to restore his faith. He replied:His question was not out of doubt; he was merely asking for an increase in certainty (ziyādat al-yaqīn) to the faith he already had. Thus he asked for an unveiling of the cover of visual beholding with his physical eyes, so that by the light of certainty, his own certainty regarding God�s omnipotence might be increased, and [his certainty] regarding His creative [power] mightth be consolidated. Do you not notice how when He asked [him], �Why, do you not believe?� he replied �Yes.� If he had been in doubt he would not have said �Yes�. Furthermore, if God was aware of any doubt in him and had he given Him the answer �Yes�, [attempting to] conceal his doubt, God would definitely have disclosed that, Exalted is He, as such things cannot be concealed from Him. Therefore, this confirms that the request for [his heart�s] reassurance (ṭumaʾnīna) signified a request for an increase in his certainty. Then it was asked, �Surely the people of the �Table Spread� sought profound peace of mind, through the sending down of the feast, and their [request] was out of doubt. So how does this correspond?� He replied:Abraham  made it known that he was a believer, and he only asked for profound peace of mind in addition to faith in order to receive greater [certainty]. The people of the Table Spread, on the other hand, made it known that they would believe only after they had found calm reassurance in their hearts. As He said: and that our hearts may be reassured, and that we may know that you have spoken to us truthfully [5:113]. Thus they made it known that their knowledge of his [Jesus�] truthfulness, after they had been reassured by witnessing the feast, was to be the starting point of their faith.Abū Bakr [al-Sijzī] said: I heard him say on another occasion:�But so that my heart may be reassured� [2:260] � that is, �I do not feel secure against one of Your enemies challenging me if I should say, My Lord is He who gives life and death [2:258], and then [one of them] should ask, �Did you see Him give life and death?� In this way my heart would be at ease in being able to answer �Yes� to him, once I had witnessed that."

He also described them as having the qualities of contentment (riḍā) and satisfaction [with their lot] (qunūʿ), for He said, Exalted is He, �They do not beg from men importunately [2:273].These are the People of the Bench (Ahl al-Ṣuffa) of the Messenger of God  who were about forty men.

They had no ability (istiṭāʿa), nor any strength (quwwa) except in Him and from Him. He was their power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa). He uprooted from them the power for their hearts to depend (sukūn) on anything other than Him, which is the incitement (waswasa) of the lower self towards that which is other than God, Exalted is He. Because of this [quality] they are elevated in their [spiritual] state. But [this is unlike] the one whom God turns back to the acquiescence of his lower self (musākana nafsihi), [about whom] He said, It belonged to deprived people (masākin) who worked at sea [18:79]. He returned them to the situation in which they had acquiesced. However, as regards the poor and needy person (faqīr), whose want has made him surrender himself to God, Exalted is He, his action involves[combatting] the desire (hawā) of his lower self, and thus he is in a better state than the one who acquiesces in whatever state he is in, due to following his lower self.ʿUmar b. Wāṣil said, �If one needy of God (faqīr ilā�Llāh), Mighty and Majestic is He, is satisfied, [yet] does not depend on [his state of] contentment (riḍā) and self-surrender (taslīm), then both names are true for him: poverty (faqr) and lowliness (maskana).� Abū Bakr [al-Sijzī] said that he heard Sahl say:The poor person is [one who is both] poor [and] helpless (faqīr ʿājiz)."

For endurance (mukābada) and struggle (mujāhada) are a part of faith ⸢for the sake of God (īmān li�Llāh)⸣. Then, when the heart ceases to have fear of all other than Him, the light of certainty is unveiled, and the servant who abides in faith for the sake of God, attains ⸢to faith in [or through] God (īmān bi�Llāh)⸣, with an unshakeable realisationof His oneness (tawḥīdan ʿalā tamkīn), by which I mean, his heart is in a state of tranquil and confident repose with his Master (sukūn qalbihi ilā mawlāhu). Consequently, the light of certainty unveils the knowledge of the eye of certainty (ʿilm ʿayn al-yaqīn), and this is the attainment (wuṣūl) of God, Exalted is He. For this certainty, by virtue of the light of certainty (bi-nūr al-yaqīn) that leads to the eye of certainty, is not ⸢something that is brought into being (mukawwan)⸣, nor is it something created (makhlūq); rather it is a light from the light of the essence of God (dhāt al-Ḥaqq), not in the sense of an indwelling (ḥulūl), nor of conjoining (jamʿ), or conjunction (ittiṣāl). Rather, the meaning of the servant�s attainment (ittiṣāl) of his Master refers to the [true] locating (mawḍiʿ) of his realisation of the divine oneness, and his obedience to God and His Messenger.So, according to the strength of his perception (baṣar) of God, he will attain full awareness (taqwā) and awe (rahba) of Him. The root of full awareness of God is in relinquishing the lower self (mubāyanat al-nafs), so let [the servant] relinquish [the lower self] for this, and not accommodate any of the pleasures [demanded by] its desire (hawā), nor any of those pleasures to which it [the lower self] is summoning him, and for which it has no excuse.

The weightier the certainty a person has the heavier will his scales weigh, even though there might [otherwise] be less in his scales.He [Sahl] was asked, �How can you tell the soundness of someone�s certainty?� To which he replied:By the strength of his confidence (thiqa) in God, Exalted is He, and his good opinion (ḥusn al-ẓann) of Him. Trust in God is witnessing (mushāhada) through certainty (yaqīn), the eye of certainty (ʿayn al-yaqīn), and the wholeness [of its vision] (kulliyyatihi).
