  "text": "O you who believe! Indeed among your spouses and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them...He said:Those among your spouses and children who induce you to the amassing of [the goods of this] world and reliance on them (rukūn ilayhā) are enemies to you. However, the one who prompts you to give of it and spend it [in a good cause], and guides you to be satisfied (qanāʿa), and to put your trust in God (tawakkul) is not an enemy to you.The saying is related from Ḥasan: \ufffdO son of Adam! Do not be beguiled by the ferocious beasts around you, namely, your son, your wife, your relatives and your servant. As for your son, he is like a lion in his ferocity and force, and will certainly contend with you concerning what you possess. As for your wife, she is like a bitch with her growling and wagging of her tail, sometimes she is growling and at other times she is wagging her tail. As for your relatives, by God, a dirham that falls to their share of your inheritance is dearer to them than your freeing of a slave. As for your servant, he is like a fox in trickery and theft. I say to you, son of Adam, fear God, and don\ufffdt break your back for their benefit, for you only have a few steps till you reach your next home, which is four cubits by two cubits. Once they have put you there, they will disperse from you, then carry out their intentions, beat the drums [in celebration], and break into guffaws of laughter, while you are being taken to account (muḥāsab) for what is left in their hands. His words, Exalted is He:"
