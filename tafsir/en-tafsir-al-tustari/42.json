Hence, God has legislated for us [Muslims] the best of the laws that the prophets brought.His words:�and that which We have revealed to you, and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus�[is] that they should uphold obedience (ṭāʿa) to God, maintain sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in that, and manifest [goodness in their] moral character (akhlāq) and states (aḥwāl).His words:"

The harvest of this world is that which is sought other than Him.He [also] said:Another shade of meaning is that he who acts for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, in a state of compliance (ījāban), without seeking a reward, [will find that] everything which is sought other than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, becomes diminished in his sight. Thus, he desires neither the world, nor Paradise, but desires only the vision (naẓar) of Him, this being the share (ḥaẓẓ) of the intuition of the spiritual self (dhihn nafs al-rūḥ), the understanding of the intellect (fahm al-ʿaql), and the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb), as when He addressed them [before] (ka-mā khāṭabahum); for conformity [lit. imitation, iqtidāʾ], on that occasion was without the presence of the natural self (nafs ṭabīʿiyya). Notwithstanding the fact that the [natural] self receives a share [of the beatific vision in Paradise], like a fragrant breeze, due to its being fused with those lights. [However,] whoever acts for the sake of this world, �We will give him of it, but in the Hereafterhe will have no portion (naṣīb), for his ⸢natural⸣ self will be occupied with the enjoyment (tanaʿʿum or naʿīm) of Paradise, which itself is its share (ḥaẓẓ), [while forgoing] its portion in the Hereafter, namely the vision of God for eternity (ruʾyat al-Ḥaqq ʿalā�l-abad).

It is related regarding this verse that Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī] said, �Whoever draws closer to God through obedience to Him, [will find that] God�s love becomes obligatory [for Him].� His words:�If anyone acquires a good deed, We shall enhance for him his goodness�He said:It refers to the cognisance (maʿrifa) [that a person should have] of his state relating to an act, before entering upon it, and after its completion, as to whether it is unhealthy (saqīm) or sound (saḥīḥ).

In its inner meaning it refers to the heart, while those around it refer to the bodily members (jawāriḥ). Therefore warn them that they might safeguard their hearts and bodily members from delighting in acts of disobedienceand following [their] lusts.His words:�and that you may warn [people] about the Day of Gathering�He said:That is, the Day when the inhabitants of the earth will be gathered for His remembrance, just as the Hosts of the Heavens are assembled [for His remembrance].His words:�[whereupon] some will be in the Garden and some will be in the Blazing Fire.He said:Whoever plants thorn trees will not reap grapes.

If God so willed He would have placed them all in obedience to Him; but He admits whomever He will into His mercy, that is, into His obedience. And the evildoers, who claim to possess the power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa), have neither guardian nor helper in [their being] contrary (khilāf) [to the state they should be in], that is, they are in a state of passivity (sukūn) with regard to [His] commandments(amr) and activity with regard to that which is forbidden (nahy).His words:"
