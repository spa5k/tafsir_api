      "text": "He who desires the life of this world and its adornment, We shall repay them their deeds...Whoever aspires by his actions (ʿamal) to [attain] something other than God, will be granted by God the reward of his actions in this world, but there will remain nothing for him in the Hereafter. For such a person does not devote his actions purely to God, due to his desire for [having] a position in this world. If he but knew that God has placed the world and its people at the service of those who desire the Hereafter, he would not be ostentatious about his acts.Sahl was asked, �What is the hardest thing for the lower self (nafs)?� He replied, �Sincerity (ikhlāṣ).� He was asked why this was so, and he said, �It is because the lower self cannot have a share in it.� He was asked, �Does ostentation (riyāʾ) penetrate the obligatory acts?� He replied:Yes, it may even penetrate faith, which is at the root of obligatory acts, so that [faith itself] is falsified and becomes hypocrisy. So how then will the acts be? Anyone whose outward conduct is not found fault with by a single person but whose real state in his inner self God knows to be the contrary, is being ostentatious without a doubt.

Thus humility is its outward [manifestation] and fear its inner state just as the Messenger  said, �If his heart had become humble his bodily members would have been subdued.� It was related of Moses  that he was once castigating the Children of Israel, when a man from amongst them tore his shirt apart. Then God, Exalted is He, inspired Moses to say to him [on behalf of God], �Do not tear your garment for Me; tear your heart for Me!�His words, Exalted is He:"

The response is [made] outwardly, the turning [to God] is through the heart, and repentance is through constantly seeking forgivenessfor one�s deficiency in these. �He will give you fair enjoyment.

However, He made the gushing forth of the wellsprings of the heart of Muḥammad  with the lights of knowledge of differentkinds a [sign of] mercy for his nation, because God, Exalted is He, honoured him with this honour. For the light of the prophets Â is from his [Muḥammad�s] light, the light of the heavenly dominions is from his light and the light of this world and the Hereafter is from his light. Whoever truly desires [God�s] love must follow him. God said to His Prophet : Say: �If you love God, follow me, and God will love you� [3:31]. Thus has He made love [consist] of following him [the Prophet], and has made the reward for His servants who follow him His love, which is the highest honour (aʿlā al-karāma).It is related on the authority of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī that he said: �While we were with the Messenger of God , he approached us and [turned to] face us as if he wished to tell us something.Then he fell into prostration and we prostrated with him at the beginning of the day until around midday, such that some of us could taste the earth through our noses and we remarked to each other, �The Messenger of God  has died.� But then he raised his head and said, �God is Great!�, so we said, �God is Great!�. Then someone said to him, �O Messenger of God, we thought you had died and if that had been the case we would not have cared if the sky fell onto the earth.� He said, �My beloved, the Angel Gabriel  came to me and said to me, �O Muḥammad, your Lord greets you with peace and gives you the choice between a third of your nation entering Paradise and the right to intercession."

Thus, when he remembers it [that knowledge], he sighs, and keeps silent regarding the question of the knowledge of his end (khātima), since he has no [power of] choosing (ikhtiyār) with God, Mighty and Majestic is He.Then Sahl said:Fear is male and hope is female, and if one iota of the fear of the fearful (khāʾifūn) were divided among the inhabitants of the earth, they would all attain eternal happiness by it.Then he was asked, �If that is so, how much fear do the fearful have?� He replied, �It is like a mountain,a mountain!�His words, Exalted is He:"
