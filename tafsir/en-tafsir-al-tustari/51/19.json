  "text": "and there was a share in their wealth [assigned] for the beggar and the deprived.He said:That is, [they give] alms both to those who ask for them and to those who do not ask.Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said:In my time I came across people among whom [it was the custom for] the man to adjure his family never to turn away any supplicant. I also came across people among whom a man would leave his brother responsible for his family for forty years. [Moreover,] the members of his household would suffer a supplicant even if they were neither of jinn nor of humankind. Those who came before you only took from this world what was absolutely necessary. They would sell their own selves for the sake of kindness [to others]. May God have mercy on the person who lives the simplest of lives, eating just a crust of bread, and wearing worn-out clothes, who is the lowliest of men, strives hard in his worship, cries over the misdeed he commits, flees from punishment and seeks God\ufffds mercy up to the moment when death overtakes him, he being in that state.\ufffd It was related that a man came to the Prophet  and said, \ufffdO Messenger of God \ufffd may God make me your ransom! \ufffd what is the matter with me that I dislike death?\ufffd He said, \ufffdDo you have wealth?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdYes.\ufffd So [the Prophet] said, \ufffdThen give away your wealth.\ufffd [The man] replied, \ufffdI am incapable of doing that, O Messenger of God.\ufffd [The Prophet said ], \ufffdTruly, aman\ufffds heart is with his wealth, so if he gives his wealth away, it will want to go along with it, but if he holds on to it, it will want to remain with it.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
