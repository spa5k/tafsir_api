Then He assembled you stage by stage. Do you not see this remarkable omnipotence (qudra), and hence believe in His unicity (waḥdāniyya) and His omnipotence (qudra)?Furthermore, God, Exalted is He, has created within the soul of the son of Adam one thousand and eighty portents, three hundred and sixty of which are apparent and three hundred and sixty of which are hidden, but which you could see if He unveiled them to you. The [remaining] three hundred and sixty of them are obscure and are only known to a prophet or veracious person (ṣiddīq). If just one of these [latter portents] were to be revealed to the possessors of intellects (ahl al-ʿuqūl), they would attain sincerity (ikhlāṣ).Truly God, Exalted is He, has veiled the hearts of those who are heedless (ghāfilūn) from His remembrance due to their pursuance of lusts, which [prevent them] from perceiving these portents.However, He has unveiled them to the hearts of those who have gnosis of Him (ʿārifūn), thereby causing them to attain it [sincerity].His words, Exalted is He:"
