So bring me back from the grief and solitude of those who oppose [You] (mukhālifūn) to the intimacy (uns) of those who are in conformity [with You] (muwāfiqūn).� Then God provided for him the companionship of Shuʿayb  and his children.His words, Exalted is He:"

Whoever takes from it [the world] out of a necessity [that arises] within himself or to fulfil a duty that is required of him, will not be deprived of what is better in this world, namely, the joy of worship (ʿibāda) and thelove of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and in the Hereafter of the highest ranks (al-darajāt al-ʿulā). Someone said to ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays, �You have contented yourself with just a little from this world.� He replied, �Shall I not inform you of someone who has contented himself with even less than myself?� [Those present] said, �Please do!� He answered, �He who has contented himself with having his share of this world in the Hereafter!� His words:"

      "text": "[He said] �In fact I have been given it [this wealth] because of knowledge I possess��He said:No one who has regard for himself will triumph; nor a state come into being for anyone who claims to possess it. The fortunate person is he who averts his eye from [looking upon] his states and acts; ⸢to him is opened⸣ the way of receiving grace (faḍl) and being gracious to [others] (ifḍāl), whilst keeping sight of God�s favour in [the accomplishment of] all acts. The wretched person, on the other hand, is the one who makes himself, his states (aḥwāl) and his deeds beautiful [in his eyes], to the point where he becomes proud of them, and then claims [responsibility for] them himself. His disgrace will ruin him one day if it does not ruin him in the present. See how God spoke of Korah with His words: I have been given it [this wealth] because of knowledge I possess, that is, merit (faḍl). This was because he was the most learned among them with regard to the Torah. He claimed merit for himself and so God made the earth beneath him swallow him up. This is the outer meaning [of the verse]. But just how many a person has sunk low through vices (ashrār), whilst being quite unaware of [what he is doing]. Sinking low [through] vices means a person�s being deprived of [divine] protection (ʿiṣma) and being left to his own power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa), so that his tongue is loosened and he starts to utter great claims. It also means he will be blind to God�s favour, and fail to show gratitude for what he has been given. At this point it will be time for [his] demise.His words, Exalted is He:"
