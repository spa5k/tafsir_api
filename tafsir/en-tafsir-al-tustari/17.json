This is due to the fact that when the servant listens, his innermost secret is humbled in submission (khashaʿa), and his heart is illuminated by this with truthful proofs (barāhīn ṣādiqa). Furthermorehis bodily members are adorned with self-abasement (tadhallul) and obedient submission (inqiyād). But God knows best. His words:"

For it may be that when a person supplicates, he asks for something that will lead to his ruin without realising it. Do you not see that God, Exalted is He, says, And man prays for ill as [avidly] as he prays for good? The one who remembers [God] constantly, and who abandons choice (ikhtiyār), supplication (duʿāʾ) and petitioning (suʾāl), will be granted the best that could be desired, and the ills of petitioning and choice will fall away from him. For this reason the Messenger of God  said, �To those whose remembrance of Me kept them from petitioning Me, I will grant the best that petitioners ask for.� His words, Exalted is He:"

This day your own soul suffices as your own reckoner.He said:The following saying is related from Ḥasan al-Baṣrī: �Prepare for the questioning with an answer, and [be ready] to respond with what is correct. Or else, prepare to have the Fire as your cloak.� ʿUmar  said: �Call yourselves to account before you are called to account. Weigh yourselves up before you are weighed up, and prepare for the great [Day of] Exposure before you are exposed.� Sahl was asked about the calling to account (muḥāsaba) and the weighing up (muwāzana). He said:The calling to account is of two kinds: the accounting that concerns those matters which are between the servant and his Lord, and this is in secret; and the accounting that concerns matters that are between him and other people, and that is done openly. The weighing up is when you have before you [the possibility of] two obligatory acts, two Sunna acts, or two supererogatory acts (nafl). After reflecting on which of them will bring you closer to God and is weightier with Him, you start with that act. His words:"

Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, �The awwāb is the penitent who repents without delay. Indeed he is ready (muhayyaʾ) for repentance at every instant and moment.� It was related on the authority of Ḍamra b. Ḥabīb that the Prophet  said: �He for whom a door to goodness has been opened should seize [the opportunity] as he does not know when it will close on him.� This means that he should seriouslyconsider his present moment (waqt) and not procrastinate.His words, Exalted is He:"

Then he said:Truly, fear and hope are two restraining ties (zamāmān) for mankind. If they have equal [sway], a person�s condition [lit. states aḥwāl] will be stabilised, but if one of them preponderates, theother will be cancelled out.

Then [eventually] you give up all dependency on your own power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa) and recognise His power and His strength. This verse is a refutation of the Qadarīs, who claim to have ability for themselves without [the need for] God, Exalted is He. God, Exalted is He, has said, Do you feel secure that He will not cause a slope of land to engulf you, or unleash upon you a storm of pebbles? [17:68] And He said, or unleash upon you a shattering gale to drown you [17:69]. So, if they really have ability (istiṭāʿa), let them repel the punishment from themselves.His words, Exalted is He:"
