This means that his Lord protected him, and if it had not been for the protection of his Lord, he would have desired her, inclining towards that to which his lower self called [him]. He was protected by witnessing the proof (burhān) of his Lord, Mighty and Majestic is He, this being that the angel Gabriel  came in the form of Jacob  biting on his finger, upon which Joseph headed for the door while seeking forgiveness. His words, Exalted is He:"
