The guidance is up to You.\ufffd Sahl was asked about the words of the Prophet : \ufffdThe effort of a striving person cannot avail him against You.\ufffd He said:Whoever is assiduous in his quest, but finds his assiduity (jidd) is met by an impediment (man ø) from You, will not be benefitted by striving in his quest.And he said:For sure, the inner truth [or secret, sirr] has not been revealed to people, for if it were disclosed to them then they would have perceived it. Nor have they witnessed [it], for if they had witnessedit, the whole matter would be over, and that is a grave matter. Then he [Sahl] said:The People of \ufffdThere is no God but God\ufffd are many but the sincere among them are few. But God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
