  "text": "He who desires the life of this world and its adornment, We shall repay them their deeds...Whoever aspires by his actions (ʿamal) to [attain] something other than God, will be granted by God the reward of his actions in this world, but there will remain nothing for him in the Hereafter. For such a person does not devote his actions purely to God, due to his desire for [having] a position in this world. If he but knew that God has placed the world and its people at the service of those who desire the Hereafter, he would not be ostentatious about his acts.Sahl was asked, \ufffdWhat is the hardest thing for the lower self (nafs)?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdSincerity (ikhlāṣ).\ufffd He was asked why this was so, and he said, \ufffdIt is because the lower self cannot have a share in it.\ufffd He was asked, \ufffdDoes ostentation (riyāʾ) penetrate the obligatory acts?\ufffd He replied:Yes, it may even penetrate faith, which is at the root of obligatory acts, so that [faith itself] is falsified and becomes hypocrisy. So how then will the acts be? Anyone whose outward conduct is not found fault with by a single person but whose real state in his inner self God knows to be the contrary, is being ostentatious without a doubt. His words, Exalted is He:"
