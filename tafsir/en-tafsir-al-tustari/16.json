Then they struggledto keep themselves in the company of the people of goodness (khayr). Subsequently, they were steadfast in this and did not go back to the situation they were in at the beginning of events.Once a man asked Sahl, �I have wealth and strength and I want to perform jihād. What do you command me to do?� Sahl answered:Wealth is knowledge (ʿilm), strength is intention (nīya) and jihād is the struggle with the lower self (mujāhadat al-nafs). No one is assured safety concerning what God has forbidden except a prophet or veracious person (ṣiddīq).Abū ʿUthmān was asked the meaning of his [Sahl�s] saying, �Except a prophet or veracious one (ṣiddīq).� He replied, �He does not enter into anything whose safety [or benignity] (ʿāfiya) is in question.His words:"

Truly, they desired with a [wholehearted] intention that they should come to know of the blessings that God, Exalted is He, had bestowed on them, that [their state of] gratitude might endure, and the increase [resulting from that gratitude] might continue.�Then when misfortune befalls you, to Him you cry for help.That is, to Him alone do you call in times of deprivation (faqr) and affliction (balāʾ). [Moreover] this may [itself] be a blessing from God upon you, for if He so wished He could have afflicted you with something severer than that, so in comparison to a severer affliction, it is a blessing, for [under a severer affliction] they would recoil in fear from it, and neither exercise patience (ṣabr) nor show gratitude.It came to our knowledge that God, Exalted is He, revealed to David  the words: �Be patient with the provisions (maʾūna) you have [from Me], and you will be granted help (maʿūna) from Me�.

For that which was legitimate, there will be an accounting (ḥisāb), and for that which was forbidden, there will be punishment (ʿiqāb).� Indeed, the believers are made to account for what they enjoyed legitimately in excess of their needs. Whoever takes of what is legitimate [only] that which suffices him, falls under the category mentioned by the Prophet  when he said, �Worldliness is not in the consumption of a piece of dry bread by which a person abates his hunger, a garment by which he covers his private parts and carries out what is legally binding upon him, or a house which shelters him from the sun and cold in winter.� His words, Exalted is He:"
