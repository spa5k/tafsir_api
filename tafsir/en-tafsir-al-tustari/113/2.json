Aʿṣam al-Yahūdī cast into the well of Banū Bayāḍa a spell against the Prophet, who used to frequent it. [One day as] he headed towards [the well] the spell [cast against him] possessed him and the Prophet  became affected by it, so God sent down the two sūras of seeking refuge (muʿawwidhatayn), and the Angel Gabriel  informed him of the magic spell. Then he sent two men among the Companions to [the well] and theytook it [the knot] out of the well. They brought it to the Prophet , upon which he started to untie the knot reciting the verses the while, so that the Messenger  was cured without delay after having completed the two sūras.After this occurrence, Labīd used to go to the Prophet  but he did not see any trace of [his spell] on the face of the Prophet , neither did he mention to him [what he had done]."
