One day the youth encountered a woman to whom he took a fancy. However, as soon as he was on the point of committing an indecent act, the divine protection descended upon him and he fell down on his face in a swoon. The woman then carried him to his house. He had a father who was an old man and it was his wont when evening fell to sit in front of his door waiting for his son\ufffds return. When the old man saw him he also fell into a swoon. When he regained his senses he asked his son about his condition. So he recounted the story, but then suddenly yelled with one cry and fell down dead. After he was buried 平Umar  stood up and recited over his grave: But for whosoever feared the standing [before] their Lord, there will be two gardens, upon which he [the young man] cried to him from the grave, \ufffdGod has given them to me and has granted me a third along with them.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
