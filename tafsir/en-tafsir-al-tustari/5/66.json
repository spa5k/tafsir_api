Furthermore, if you had turned to the Provider (al-Razzāq), your provision would have been taken care of. Then he said:You are not greater than ʿAmr b. Layth, who would march with one thousand horsemen and one thousand foot soldiers in his charge, each one holding a mace of gold and silver. Eventually it came to pass that he was imprisoned in a house after being handed over to the Caliph, who subsequently deprived him of food and drink. When his door was opened they found him dead with his mouth full of straw and clay due to his intense hunger. Then he [the Caliph] said, \ufffdTruly I have advised you and truly I am among those who give you good counsel.\ufffdIt was related by Mālik b. Dīnār, from Ḥammād b. Salma and Ḥammād b. Yazīd, that these two came to visit Rābiʿa, and mentioned something concerning the matters of this world. So Rābi\ufffda said, \ufffdYou are talking about this world a lot. I think you must be hungry, so if you are hungrygo over to that pot with the flour and make yourselves whatever takes your fancy.\ufffd Then, one of those who were with her remarked, \ufffdIf only we had some garlic.\ufffd Ḥammād continued, \ufffdThen I saw Rābiʿa\ufffds lips moving and she had not even finished before a bird came with a clove of garlic in its beak which it cast down and then flew off. His words, Exalted is He:"
