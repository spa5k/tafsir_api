Our knowledge is only of what they outwardly affirmed on their tongues. \ufffdYou, only You are the Knower of things unseen.\ufffd[Sahl] was asked, \ufffdWill He ask them about what was really in the hearts of [their] communities?\ufffd He replied:No, He only directed the question to them concerning their outward reality, which is in fact only an expression of their inner reality. They [the prophets] responded by indicating that [only He] possesses knowledge [of the answer]. It could also mean, \ufffdWe have no knowledge of the meaning of your question, since You already have knowledge of our reply \ufffd You, only You, are the Knower of things unseen.\ufffdhÌ£His words:"
