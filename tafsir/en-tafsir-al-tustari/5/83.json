They came to the Prophet , and the Qurʾān was recited for them. They were deeply moved by it so that their eyes overflowed [with tears], and they were not haughty, due to God\ufffds protecting them from pride. Subsequently, they entered His religion because of the knowledge of God which He had deposited within them.Then he said:The corruption of religion is in three things: when kings commit excess[es] and [follow] their lusts; when the scholars issue rulings based on concessions; and when the Qurʾān reciters worshipwithout knowledge. Truly, people need the learned (ʿulamāʾ) for their life in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, it was related by Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh  from the Prophet  that he said: \ufffdThe people of Paradise need the learned just as much as the people need them in this world. They visit their Lord every Friday and it is said to them: \ufffdDesire anything you want\ufffd, after which they head for the scholars, who tell them, \ufffdDesire such and such a thing\ufffd, so they desire that thing.\ufffd His words:"
