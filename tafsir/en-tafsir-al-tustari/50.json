In its outer meaning it refers to the mountain which surrounds this world, which is the first mountain God, Exalted is He, created. Then after it, He created Mount Abū Qubays, which is the mountain which rises above Ṣafā. Beyond this, by a distance of one year�s journey, is a mountain behind which the sun sets, just as He said: until it [the sun] disappeared behind [night�s] veil [38:32]. It has a face like a human face and a heart like the hearts of the angels in gnosis (fi�l-maʿrifa).

The angels do not know the good and evil that is within a person�s conscience (ḍamīr) save when that person�s heart acquiesces in it [either good or evil]. When there is a resolution [to do] something good, its effect will manifest a beautiful perfume within the breast (ṣadr) and thence from the breast to the bodilymembers; whereas when there is a resolution to do evil it manifests darkness and a rotten smell. In any event, God knows all of this from [the servant], so he should fear Him in accordance with His words, Surely God has been watchful over you [4:1].His words, Exalted is He:"
