He then said:Impose upon yourselves three things, for the best of [all] that is in this world and the Hereafter is contained within them: keeping [your self] close to [lit. making it consort with, suḥbatuhā] His commandments and prohibitions by adherence to the Sunna; establishing within it the attestation of God\ufffds oneness, which [brings about] certainty (yaqīn), [and imposing upon it] knowledge (ʿilm), through which the spirit attains union (fīhi ittiṣāl al-rūḥ). The one who possessesthese three [traits] is more knowledgeable about what is in the earth\ufffds core than about what is on its surface, and he regards the Hereafter more than he regards this world. Furthermore, he is better known to the angels in heaven than he is on earth to his own family and relatives.He was asked: \ufffdWhat is the knowledge through which the spirit attains union?\ufffd [He replied]:It is the knowledge that God is taking care of it, and being contented [with that].
