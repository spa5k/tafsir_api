And the hands of the believers, that is, despite being side by side with the believers, witnessing them and sitting with them, they were deprived of their blessings. So take heed, O you who have eyes, that God leads astray whomever He will [35:8], through abandonment (khidhlān), and guides whomever He will [35:8], through His assistance (maʿūna), and you have no influence in the matter.His words, Exalted is He:"
