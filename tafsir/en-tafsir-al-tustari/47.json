If only they had sought them by having recourse to God-given success (tawfīq) and grace (faḍl), they would have attained them [the keys]. The key is to know that God is taking care of you (qāʾim ʿalayka), and watching over (raqīb) your bodily members, and to know that works are not complete without sincerity (ikhlāṣ) accompanied by heedfulness (murāqāba) [of God].His words:"
