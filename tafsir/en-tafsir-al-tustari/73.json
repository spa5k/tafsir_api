It is also said, more correct in speech because of being further away from ostentation.Ḥasan said (may God have mercy on him), �I met people who were able to perform acts [of worship] in secret, but preferred to do them openly. I also met people [whose custom was] that if one of them received guests, he would get up at night for prayer in order that none of his guests would notice him.� Luqmān used to say to his son, �O my son! Do not be less than this cockerel which crows at night.� His words, Exalted is He:"

Paradise ⸢is safety (ʿāfiya),⸣ and safety is that Godtakes care of your affairs, and Hellfire is tribulation (balwā). Tribulation is when He leaves you in charge of your self. He was asked, �What is the (way to) relief (faraj)?� He replied:Do not hope for relief while you still look to what is created. There is not a servant who desired God with a genuine resolve (ʿazm ṣaḥīḥ), without everything vanishing from his [consciousness] besides Him. Moreover, there is not a servant from whom everything has vanished besides Him, who does not deserve that God take charge of his affairs. [At the same time], there is not in this world a person who is [truly] obedient to God while he is [also] obeying his lower self, and no one becomes distanced from God except through engagement in that which is other than God.Things only have access to someone who is idle (fārigh). However, evil suggestions (waswasa) will not reach a person whose heart is occupied with God; such a one is in [a state] of continuousincrease. So protect yourself through [adhering to] the principle (aṣl).He was asked, �And what is that [principle]?� He answered;It is submission (taslīm) to God�s command, and freeing oneself (tabarrī) of all other than Him.His words, Exalted is He:"
