  "text": "Say, \ufffdMy Lord extends provision to whomever He wills of His servants, and restricts it for him\ufffd\ufffdHe said:Provision (rizq) is of two kinds: a provision that is remembrance [providing nourishment] for the spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ), the intellect (ʿaql) and the heart (qalb), which resembles the sustenance of the angels \ufffd their very life (ʿaysh) is in remembrance, and were this to be withheldfrom them they would perish. The other kind of provision is that which is eaten, drunk and so on for the benefit of one\ufffds [physical] nature (ṭabʿ). It is this kind which falls under what is permitted (ḥalāl) or prohibited (ḥarām). The legitimate is that which God, Exalted is He, has provided for us, and commanded us to partake of. The prohibited, on the other hand, is what God, Exalted is He, has provided but forbidden, and this is the portion of the Fire. And I do not know anything more difficult than averting the harm [of others] (kaff al-adhā) and adhering to what is permitted.His words, Exalted is He:"
