  "text": "O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends\ufffdHe said:God, Exalted is He, has warned the believers not to take as friends other than those whom God and His Messenger have befriended. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, is not [even] pleased ⸢when one who is His friend⸣ depends upon [another who is] His friend, so how will it be when he depends on [one who is] His enemy? Furthermore, a person who engages his heart in that which does not concern him relating to his Hereafter gains an enemy, so how will it be concerning some other [affair that does not concern him]?And a person who covets (ṭamaʿa) the Hereafter along with a desire for something lawful (ḥalāl) of this world is deluded (makhdūʿ), so how will it be for someone who desires something unlawful (ḥarām)?Anyone\ufffds act that is not done in opposition (mukhālafa), or with endurance (mukābada), or out of preferring others over oneself (īthār), will be an act of ostentation (riyāʾ).He was asked the meaning of this. He replied:Opposition is the abandonment of what is forbidden, and for sure, abandoning a particle of what God has forbidden is more meritorious than worshipping God, Exalted is He, for your whole life. To show endurance is to fulfil God\ufffds commandments, while to prefer others over oneself is to prefer God above all that is other than Him.Furthermore, through opposition they were dispossessed of their selves, but through endurancethey were dispossessed of their desires, so that their passions (shahawāt) were expressed through acts of obedience (ṭāʿāt); and by giving preference to others over themselves (īthār), they attained His love and good pleasure.His words, Exalted is He:"
