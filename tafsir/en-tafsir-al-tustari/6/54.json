Truly, whoever of you does evil in ignorance, and repents thereafter and makes amends \ufffd truly He is Forgiving, Merciful.It has been reported that God, Exalted is He, revealed to David , \ufffdO David, whoever knows Me, desires Me; whoever desires Me, loves Me; whoever loves Me, seeks Me out; whoever seeks Me out, finds Me; and whoever finds Me, preserves Me [in his heart] (ḥafiẓanī)\ufffd. David  replied [by asking], \ufffdO my Lord! Where can I find You when I wish to seek you out?\ufffd He said, \ufffdWith those whose hearts are broken from the fear of Me.\ufffd David then said, \ufffdO my Lord! I approached the doctors among Your servants for treatment, but they all directed me to You \ufffd Wretched are those who despair of Your mercy! Is there a chance of my being worthy of being cured by You?\ufffd God, Mighty and Majestic is He, asked him, \ufffdDid all those you approached guide You to Me?\ufffd He answered, \ufffdYes\ufffd, and God said, \ufffdThen go and give the sinners good tidings, and give warning to the veracious (ṣiddīqūn).\ufffd David was baffled and said, \ufffdHave I misunderstood or not?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdYou are not mistaken.\ufffd David asked, \ufffdHow is that?\ufffd He said: \ufffdGive the sinners the good tidings that I am forgiving (ghafūr) and warn the veracious (ṣiddīqūn) that I am jealous (ghayūr).\ufffd He [Sahl] was asked, \ufffdWho are veracious?\ufffd He replied:They are those who combat their lower selves through the glorification (taṣbīḥ) and veneration(taqdīs) [of God]. Furthermore, they are those who keep their bodily limbs and senses in check. Hence, they become veracious in speech and action, veracious outwardly and inwardly, veracious in their involvement in anything and likewise in their disengagement from anything. Consequently, their place of return is an abode of truth ⸢in the lofty rank of truth⸣ with the All-Powerful King. His words, Transcendent and Exalted is He:"
