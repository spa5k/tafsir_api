For them there is no form of repentance. Thus, has it been related from the Prophet  that he said, \ufffdFor every sin there is a form of repentance except for that of the people of whims and innovations, for truly I disown them just as they disown me, and God, Mighty and Majestic is He, has excluded them from repentance (tawba).\ufffd That is, He has made the way to repentance difficult for them.His words, Exalted is He:"
