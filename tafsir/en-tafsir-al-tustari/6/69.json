Thus, it is incumbent upon the friends of God to guide [people] to Him, and if they desist from doing so they are falling short of their duty.It was put to him, \ufffdIndeed, we have seen many who desist from doing this.\ufffd He replied:They only hold back from doing it when there is a lack of need for it, just as is the case with the commanding of what is right (amr bi\ufffdl-maʿrūf) and the forbidding of what is wrong (nahy ʿan al-munkar).
