  "text": "\ufffdAnd if you speak, be just...He said:The people of veracity (ṣidq) speak in four ways: they speak in God, through God, for God or with God. There are other people who speak to themselves and for themselves, and so they are preserved from the evil of speech. Yet other people speak about others and forget themselves, and so they innovate and go astray. Wretched is that which they have produced for themselves! So abandon speech for knowledge, and then only speak when it is necessary, and you will be preserved from the ills of speech. What is meant [by \ufffdwhen it is necessary\ufffd] is that you should not speak unless you are afraid that you will otherwise fall into sin.Then he said:Whoever makes a [false] assumption (ẓann) will be deprived of certainty, and whoever speaks about that which does not concern him will be deprived of veracity. Furthermore, whoever occupies his bodily members for other than the sake of God, Exalted is He, will be deprived of scrupulous piety (waraʿ). If a servant is deprived of these three he is ruined. Furthermore, he will be set down in the records as being among the enemies [of God].Truly, it was related from al-Rabīʿ b. Khuthaym, may God have mercy on him, ⸢that no one ever heard him speak about matters of the world (amr al-dunya). Someone asked him \ufffdWhy do you not mention people (al-nās), may God have mercy on you?\ufffd⸣ He replied, \ufffdI am not satisfied with myself to the extent that I should be done with censuring myself, and turn to the the censure (dhamm) of others. [Yet people] fear God with regard to the sins of His servants, and leap into their own sins.\ufffd His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:"
