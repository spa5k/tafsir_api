This is as in the saying narrated from the Prophet , �They are my nation and, by the Lord of the Kaʿba, they remained on the straight path and did not commit association (shirk) like the Jews and the Christians.� ʿUmar  said, �They did not evade [the truth] with the evasiveness of foxes�. His words:�the angels descend to them and say, �Do not fear nor grieve...�That is, at the time of death. Indeed, the Prophet  said, �God, Exalted is He, says: �I have never hesitated over anything as much as I have hesitated over snatching (qabḍ) the soul (rūḥ) of the believer��, by which He means, �The angels never hesitate over anything as much as they hesitate over snatching the soul of My believing servant, which they do while giving him good tidings (bashāra) and treating him with honour (karāma) saying, �Do not fear for your souls and do not grieve about the Day of Gathering��, just as He has said, The Supreme Terror shall not grieve them [21:103].He said:[He is] the One who takes you all into His care (al-mutawallī li-jumlatikum) with [His] good pleasure (riḍā), protecting your hearts, and delighting your eyes with the [divine] manifestation (tajallī), in reward for your profession of His oneness and as a favour (tafaḍḍul) from your Lord.His words:"
