Among the proprieties (ādāb), it refers to the noblest character traits. It means that even if one should be enticed [by reward] (targhīb), one does not reveal a secret, and even if one should be intimidated (tarhīb), one does not remain on the side of ignorance. Furthermore, full awareness of God is not acceptable except in the one who is a follower of the Prophet  and the Companions.His words:"

Sleep (nawm) [only descends] on the heart outwardly. That is the rule (ḥukm) [for] sleep. However, the same rule [that applied to the heart] regarding drowsiness [applies to] the spirit (rūḥ).

Likewise goodness (ṭayyib) is manifested in different forms: [that is to say], goodness is faith (īmān), within which are included the [different] ranks of the prophets (anbiyāʾ), veracious (ṣiddīqūn), martyrs (shuhadāʾ) and virtuous (ṣāliḥūn). God, Exalted is He, has informed us that He has separated them from one another [i.e. the good from the bad], and He then ranks the corrupt, one above the other, according to the measure of each of their sins, level upon level, just as He has said: Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire [4:145].His words:"
