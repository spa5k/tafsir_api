  "text": "I shall turn away from My signs those who behave arrogantly in the earth without right\ufffdHe [Sahl] said:It means that He will deprive them of understanding the Qurʾān, and following the Messenger . It has been related from the Prophet  that he said, \ufffdWhoever has been given understanding of the Qurʾān has been given abundant good. However, whoever has been denied understanding of the Qurʾān has been denied access to a great science (ʿilm ʿaẓīm).\ufffd Also, the Prophet  said: \ufffdA part of magnifying (taʿẓīm) God is honouring (ikrām) the elderly in Islam, honouring the just leader, and honouring the person who has memorised the Qurʾān, whilst not exceeding the proper bounds in this.\ufffd His words:\ufffd[those who] if they see the way of error, adopt it as a way\ufffdHe [Sahl] said:He returned them to what He knew concerning them in His prior knowledge, which was thatthey would do that [which is mentioned in the verse]. His forsaking (khidhlān) them is because of what they were directed to by their natural selves (anfusuhum al-ṭabīʿiyya), namely, being active regarding His prohibitions, and passive regarding His commandments, and [falsely] claiming to have the power and strength [to do] that which their souls had a propensity for, and their conceit (ightirār) in that.His words, Exalted is He:"
