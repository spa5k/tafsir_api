  "text": "Do they feel secure from God\ufffds plotting?...He [Sahl] said:The plotting (makr) belongs to His design (tadbīr) within His prior knowledge, and it pertains to His omnipotence, hence no one should feel secure against His plotting, for feeling secure against it does not repel anything that has been preordained (qadar). No one can exit the [sphere of] His omnipotence, Exalted is He. No one should feel free of fear, even if they [think] they have experienced all [possible] fear. However, once someone recognises his station (manzila) with God, Exalted is He, his knowledge will increase and his desire (raghba) will be fulfilled. But as for the one who does not know his station, that will be a source of shame (ʿār) for him.ʿUmar Wāṣil said that he then asked [Sahl], \ufffdHow does a person\ufffds station rise in accordance with his knowledge?\ufffd He answered:There are two [kinds of] men: there is the man who rises [in his spiritual station] and asks for [further] elevation, being avid for this; and then there is the man who is weaker than the other, whose [request] derives from gratitude, lest God should take back what He has given him.His words, Exalted is He:"
