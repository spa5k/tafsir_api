Thus, you feel shame before Him and give Him priority over yourself in all your affairs.Then he said:The one who claims to keep remembrance (dhikr) is not necessarily one who [truly] remembers [God] (dhākir).He was asked, \ufffdWhat is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet : \ufffdThe world is accursed and what it contains is accursed save the remembrance of God (dhikr Allāh), most High?\ufffd\ufffd [He replied]:His saying \ufffdthe remembrance of God\ufffd here means renouncing what is unlawful (zuhd ʿan al-ḥarām), that is, when something unlawful comes a person\ufffds way he remembers God, Exalted is He, and he knows that God is watching him, so he avoids that unlawful thing. His words:\ufffdand do not be one of the heedless\ufffdSahl said:In truth I say to you without any falsehood, in certainty without a doubt, that any person who spends a breath in other than God\ufffds remembrance does so while being heedless of God, Mighty and Majestic is He.He also said:Heedlessness (ghafla) among the elite (khāṣṣ) is acquiescing (sukūn) in anything [other than Him]. Heedlessness among the generality (ʿāmm) is taking pride (iftikhār) in anything [other than Him], that is to say, it is [also] acquiescing (sukūn) [in other than Him]. His words, Exalted is He:"
