Someone said, �O Messenger of God, the shirt is better than the garment.� He said, �Truly, I would look at it during prayer.� He was distracted by the design of the shirt.� His words, Exalted is He:"

Mindfulness of God (taqwā) means abandoning everything which is reprehensible (madhmūm). With regard to the command, it is abandoning procrastination (taswīf), and with regard to what is prohibited, it is giving up the very thought of it. In terms of codes of propriety (ādāb), it refers to noble characteristics; in the case of inducement (targhīb), it means keeping a secret; and in the case of intimidation (tarhīb), it means being wary of remaining in a state of ignorance. Mindfulness of God means freeing oneself from [dependence]on all save God. Therefore, whoever observes these codes of conduct in mindfulness of God is deserving of forgiveness.It has been related that a man came to Jesus the son of Mary  and said, �O Teacher of Good (muʿallim al-khayr), how can I become mindful of God in the way that I should?� He replied, �It is very simple. Love God with all your heart, and work with a generous spirit and all your strength as much as you can. Have mercy on the souls of your own kind (jins), just as you have mercy on your own soul.� He asked, �Who are my own kind, O Teacher of Good?� He replied, �The sons of Adam. Furthermore, do not do to anyone else what you do not wish to be done to you.�But God, Glorified and Exalted is He, knows best.The following was read before Sahl and he affirmed the truth of it:ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb  said, �Whoever wishes to visualise (yabṣira) the Day of Resurrection should read Sūrat al-Qiyāma, for the resurrection of each one of you [occurs with] his death.His words, Exalted is He:"
