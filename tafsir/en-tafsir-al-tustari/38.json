He said:God only gave him [David] this when he asked Him to raise his rank to the rank enjoyed by Ishmael and Isaac. He said, �You are not on that level, O David. However, I am giving you a high rank for your wisdom, and articulation in speech (fāṣila)� � this being the saying: ammā baʿd (to proceed), which he was the first to say. Quss b. Sāʿida was the one who followed the precedent of saying this [ammā baʿd]. It has also been said decisive speech (faṣl al-khiṭāb) is lucidity (bayān) and faith (īmān). His words:We strengthened his kingdom�He said:That is, with justice (ʿadl) and with virtuous ministers to rule over it with goodness, just as the Messenger  said, �Truly, if God, Exalted is He, wills good for a ruler, He grants him a truthful minister (wazīr ṣadūq) who reminds him when he forgets, and assists him when he remembers.�His words:"

Similarly, the Prophet  said: �Truly, [when followed], desire (hawā) and lust (shahwa) overwhelm the intellect, knowledge,� and lucidity (bayān), due to the pre-eternal ordainment of God, Exalted is He.

He said:He purified Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac from the remembrance (dhikr) of this world through a remembrance of Him, purely for [His sake] (khāliṣatan), not for the attainment of recompense(jazāʾ). Neither did they witness themselves in it [their remembrance]; rather, they remembered Him through Him and for Him.
