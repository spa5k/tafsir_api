His calling is at different levels. It may be to what is evil or it may be to what is good, just as the Prophet  said, \ufffdTruly Satan will show one of you seventy doors to goodness just in order to make him enter one door to evil and thereby ruin him.\ufffdHe [Sahl] continued:Indeed, the Accursed One whispers to all those who perform acts of worship (ahl al-ʿibādāt) and strive [for the good] (aṣḥāb al-jahd), but he has no concern for them; his concern is rather for the one who does not enter into anything without knowing whether it is [spiritually] to his benefit or detriment. It is only with regard to knowledge that worshippers and renunciants (zuhhād) fall into errors, not because of their striving, for [regarding the latter] they do not possess a state in which they might discern [errors] in their relationship with God. When God, Exalted is He, calls a servant to account on the Day of Resurrection, his intellect will remain firm with regard to every action that was done with the knowledge of whether he was in a state of obedience or transgression. However, he will fall into confusion (taḥayyur) and bewilderment (dahsha) on account of whatever he did in a state of ignorance (jahl). This is because, when he knows what state (ḥāl) he is in, his obedience and repentance (tawba) will be acceptable through God\ufffds proof (ḥujja). However, if he does not know [his state] he will fall into confusion and bewilderment, because he acted without anything that could act as proof [for him before God]. Sahl was asked concerning the man who is in a state of remembering God, and the thought (khaṭar) \ufffdGod is with you\ufffd occurs to his heart. He said:It [the thought] is one of three things: it is either an enemy who wishes to cut him off [from God], or his lower self wanting to betray him, or his lower self trying to deceive him. In this case, he should not pay any attention to such thoughts (khawāṭir). His words, Exalted is He:"
