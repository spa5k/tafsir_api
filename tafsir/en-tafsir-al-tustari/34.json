The other kind of provision is that which is eaten, drunk and so on for the benefit of one�s [physical] nature (ṭabʿ). It is this kind which falls under what is permitted (ḥalāl) or prohibited (ḥarām). The legitimate is that which God, Exalted is He, has provided for us, and commanded us to partake of. The prohibited, on the other hand, is what God, Exalted is He, has provided but forbidden, and this is the portion of the Fire. And I do not know anything more difficult than averting the harm [of others] (kaff al-adhā) and adhering to what is permitted.His words, Exalted is He:"

But, God, Glorified and Exalted is He, knows best. His words, Exalted is He:"
