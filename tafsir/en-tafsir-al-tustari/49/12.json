The most ignorant person is the one who estranges his heart [from God] without being aware of it. Indeed, God, Exalted is He, has said: And that suspicion of yours which you held about your Lord has ruined you, so you have become among the losers. [41:23] Certainly, the servant is deprived of blessed provision and prayer at night because of bad opinion.One night a man, one of [God\ufffds] servants, slept through [and missed] his customary rite (wird) and felt regret over it. [He] was asked: \ufffdDo you feel regret about [missing] that which you are wont to perform?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdI do not feel regret because of that, but rather because of the sin through which I became deprived of that good [deed].\ufffdSahl was asked, \ufffdWhat is the meaning of the Prophet\ufffds words : \ufffdBe on your guard with people, [by holding a] bad opinion (sūʾ al-ẓann).\ufffd\ufffd He replied:The meaning of this is [that protection from people] is [gained by holding a] bad opinion of yourself, not of other people. In other words, accuse your own self for not treating them fairly in your dealings with them. His words:\ufffdand do not spy\ufffdHe said:That is, \ufffdDo not search out the faults that God has covered for His servants, for you may well be afflicted by that [fault].It was related of Jesus  that he used to say, \ufffdDo not speak too much other than in remembranceof God, Mighty and Majestic is He, for your hearts will be hardened, and the heart that is hard is far from God. Do not regard the faults of people as if you were their masters, but look at your own works as if they were your slaves."
