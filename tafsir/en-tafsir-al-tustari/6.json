      "text": "When God wishes to guide someone, He expands their breast to Islam�Sahl said:Truly God has distinguished between the one who seeks (murīd) and the one who is [divinely] sought (murād), even though they are both from Him (min ʿindihi). But He simply wanted to distinguish the elite (khuṣūṣ) from the generality (ʿumūm), and so He singled out the one who is sought (murād) in this sūra and others. He also mentioned the one who seeks (murīd), representing the generality, in this sūra in His words, Exalted is He: Do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance [6:52]. This is the servant�s being intent (qaṣd) upon God in his every moment of activity and stillness (fī ḥarakātihi wa sukūnihi), just as He also said: and those who hearken to their Lord and maintain the prayer� [42:38]. Thus, whoever finds that he has the state of both the seeker and the sought, that is due to a grace (faḍl) from God to him. Do you not see how He has brought them together in His words, Exalted is He: Whatever grace you have, it is from God [16:53]?He was asked, �Why are they [murīd and murād] separated then?� He said:The seeker who makes an effort to direct himself towards (qaṣd) God, Exalted is He, and to worship Him, and seeks the way to Him, is still in the state of seeking (ṭalab). As for the sought, it refers to the establishment of worship for him by God, Exalted is He. Man has within himself that which [shows him] to be both a seeker (murīd) and one who is sought (murād). At one time, ⸢he enters into his acts of obedience [applying to them] struggle (mukābada) and striving (mujāhada), and this is [when he is] at the level of the seeker (murīd), when he may be stirred [into action] (tuhayyijahu) by the inducement of hope (raghba), or by fear (rahba). Then at another time⸣, he finds himself carried through those acts without effort (taklīf) or striving (jahd), [and this is] a solicitude from God, Exalted is He, towards him. Then after that, he will move on to the highest stations (maqāmāt) and most elevated ranks (darajāt).[At this point] he was asked about the meaning of the stations (maqāmāt), and he replied:They are mentioned in the Book of God, Exalted is He, in the story about the angels, And there is not one of us but [that he] has a known station [37:164]."

Or in secret means the persistence (iṣrār) in committing that act, and this is of two kinds: the first is that a person commits a sin and persists in committing it; the other is that he persists in sin through desiring it in his heart, but he is not able to do it when he finds the opportunity because of a weakness in his bodily members, even though he is intent upon doing it. This is one of the most serious forms of persistence.Then Sahl said:Whoever eats what is permissible (ḥalāl) with gluttony is persistent (muṣirr), and whoever preoccupies himself with what the morrow may bring before the morrow arrives is persistent.He was asked about the prophets Â, regarding whether they thought about that which did not concern them. He replied:An act with their bodily members was allowed to them, considering that they repented to God, Exalted is He, afterwards, let alone a mere thought.He was asked, �Is there a form of worship for the heart, which God requires of it, other than that which is performed by the bodily members?� He replied, �Yes, it is the tranquil repose (sukūn) of the heart [in God].� Then he was asked, �Is such tranquil repose [in God] obligatory (farḍ) or the knowledge by which it is attained?� He answered, �It is a [kind of] knowledge, which I am calling tranquil repose, and that tranquil repose [in God] leads to certainty (yaqīn). Furthermore, tranquil repose accompanied with certainty is an obligation (farīḍa).�His words, Exalted is He:"

There are other people who speak to themselves and for themselves, and so they are preserved from the evil of speech. Yet other people speak about others and forget themselves, and so they innovate and go astray. Wretched is that which they have produced for themselves! So abandon speech for knowledge, and then only speak when it is necessary, and you will be preserved from the ills of speech. What is meant [by �when it is necessary�] is that you should not speak unless you are afraid that you will otherwise fall into sin.Then he said:Whoever makes a [false] assumption (ẓann) will be deprived of certainty, and whoever speaks about that which does not concern him will be deprived of veracity. Furthermore, whoever occupies his bodily members for other than the sake of God, Exalted is He, will be deprived of scrupulous piety (waraʿ). If a servant is deprived of these three he is ruined. Furthermore, he will be set down in the records as being among the enemies [of God].Truly, it was related from al-Rabīʿ b. Khuthaym, may God have mercy on him, ⸢that no one ever heard him speak about matters of the world (amr al-dunya). Someone asked him �Why do you not mention people (al-nās), may God have mercy on you?�⸣ He replied, �I am not satisfied with myself to the extent that I should be done with censuring myself, and turn to the the censure (dhamm) of others.

Furthermore, whenever God looks upon the heart of a servant and finds there that which is other than Him, He empowers his enemy over him. However, He is most forgiving to the one who repents for what he has done.No harm (maḍār) can be considered a punishment, because it [acts as] a purification and an expiation (kaffāra), except for hardness (qaswa) of the heart, for that in itself is a punishment. External punishments are a torment (ʿadhāb), but the punishments of the heart have differentlevels, for the lower self holds a share and a design with regard to the heart. [As for the one whose] heart is veiled, God empowers his enemy over him. His heart does not orbit the celestial dominions (malakūt), nor does the divine omnipotence (qudra) manifest itself to him, nor does he witness (yushāhid) God. But as for the one whose heart is hardened, God leaves him to his own devices and means. Truly the tendency of the heart may be compared to the tongue; when a person speaks, he can speak of only one thing [at a time]. Similarly if a heart is full of concern [for something] there is no room for anything along with that. But God knows best.His words, Mighty and Majestic is He:"

Furthermore, they are those who keep their bodily limbs and senses in check. Hence, they become veracious in speech and action, veracious outwardly and inwardly, veracious in their involvement in anything and likewise in their disengagement from anything.
