However, if [the person reciting] then witnesses the One remembered (madhkūr) instead of the remembrance [itself] (dhikr), the heart will become oblivious of it [the recitation], and he will not witness anything besides his Master. Consequently Satan will become one of his captives.

That which persists in coming is from the lower self, and assistance against it is sought through fasting, prayer and propriety (adab). However, that which [comes, but then] withdraws (nabdhan) is from Satan, and assistance against it is sought through the recitation of the Qurʾān and remembrance [of God] (dhikr).\ufffdHis words:"
