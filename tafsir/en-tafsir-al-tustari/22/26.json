Therefore, just as God has commandedthe purification of His House [at Mecca] from idols, so also He has commanded the purification of that house of His in which He deposited the mystery of faith (sirr al-īmān) and the light of gnosis (nūr al-maʿrifa), namely, the heart of the believer. God, Exalted is He, has commanded the believer to purify himself from rancour (ghill), deceit (ghishsh), inclination towards the lusts of the lower self (shahawāt al-nafs) and heedlessness (ghafla). For those who circumambulate it [the Kaʿba], as also for those who uphold the lights of faith, there will be manifold increase in [God-given] success (tawfīq).\ufffdAnd those who bow and prostrate themselvesin fear and hope. Truly the heart ⸢is [like] a house⸣: if it is unoccupied it goes to ruin, and [likewise] if it is occupied by other than its owner, ⸢or by other than one whom the owner has settled there⸣, it will also go to ruin. Therefore, if you wish your hearts to be in good repair, do not let your prayer in them be other than to God, Exalted is He; ⸢if you want to keep your breasts (ṣuḍūr) in good repair, let not anything be in them other than [awareness of] the Hereafter⸣; if you want to preserve your tongues, do not let your prayer on them be other than truthfulness (ṣidq); and if you wish to preserve your bodily members, do not allow them to become engaged with anything other than what is in accordance with the Sunna.His words:"
