He says, “whom neither trade nor buy- ing diverts from the remembrance of God.” If it is possible to combine the two, there is no objec- tion, but this is like something that cannot be done, except for the great ones, over whom affairs flow while they have been taken from them. This is the attribute of men whose outward occupation does not hold them back from remem- bering God. Their outwardness is with people while their inwardness is witnessing the names and attributes of the Real. They are men whose seeking is the equitable, whose remembrance is the evidence, and whose love is the path. In their eyes this world is small. They are men whose watch- word is the remembrance of God, whose blanket is God's love, whose place and settledness is the threshold of God's gentleness, whose aspirations are free from any others. They are the beauty of Firdaws, the ornament of the Abode of Settledness, begrudged by the Emigrants and envied by the Helpers, and they walk on the earth while it boasts of them. Men. These are men who have no crown or hat on their heads, and there is nothing in their hearts but God's friendship. In the street of the Friend they have no friend or companions. “When the sought is great, assistants are few.” What harm to them if in this world they are the specious coin of the bazaars? Their hearts are all hard cash. They are faulted by noblemen and rejected by neighbors, but their names are in the register of the friends. They are lifted up by gentleness, they are caressed by the All-Merciful, and their hearts are always gazing at the Real. They sit on the dust, they sleep on the earth, their hands are their pillow, the mosque is their house. What harm to them are this poverty and indigence? With one allusion of their eye, they bring rain for the world's folk; with one gaze of their heart, they rout the unbelievers; with one sorrow of their heart, they bring Gabriel into the road. And let not thine eyes turn away from them [18:28]."
