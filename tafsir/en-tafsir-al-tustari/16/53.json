Then when misfortune befalls you, to Him you cry for help.Sahl said:If God put to task the bearers of the Throne, and the angels below them [in rank], along with the prophets and messengers, concerning something they had disregarded among the blessingsthat He had bestowed upon them, He would punish [even] them for that, for God is not unjust.Sahl was asked: \ufffdWhat does God do with His servant when He loves him?\ufffd He said:He inspires him to seek forgiveness for his shortcomings and show gratitude for blessings he has received. Truly, they desired with a [wholehearted] intention that they should come to know of the blessings that God, Exalted is He, had bestowed on them, that [their state of] gratitude might endure, and the increase [resulting from that gratitude] might continue.\ufffdThen when misfortune befalls you, to Him you cry for help.That is, to Him alone do you call in times of deprivation (faqr) and affliction (balāʾ). [Moreover] this may [itself] be a blessing from God upon you, for if He so wished He could have afflicted you with something severer than that, so in comparison to a severer affliction, it is a blessing, for [under a severer affliction] they would recoil in fear from it, and neither exercise patience (ṣabr) nor show gratitude.It came to our knowledge that God, Exalted is He, revealed to David  the words: \ufffdBe patient with the provisions (maʾūna) you have [from Me], and you will be granted help (maʿūna) from Me\ufffd. His words, Exalted is He:"
