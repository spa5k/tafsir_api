So it is that Muslim b. Yasār said on the death of his son, �O my son, my grief for you has distracted me from grieving over [my loss of] you. O God, I have transferred to him the reward [which You have granted] me concerning him.� The second sign is that the happiness of this world becomes insignificant in his eyes, even though it gives him ease. The third sign is that there is nothing closer to him than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, as [is indicated by] the saying of ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays, �I never regarded anything without seeing God as closer to it than myself.� His words, Exalted is He:"

The only one who is safe from his desire (hawā) is the one who imposes propriety (adab) upon himself. The only ones who are purified in their propriety are the prophets Â and some of the veracious; and it is the same case regarding character (akhlāq).One day Ibn al-Sammāk went out to meet his companions, who had gathered to see him, and said, �I have already given you so many admonitions. Would you like my remedy for you?� They said, �Yes�. He said, �Oppose your desires (ahwāʾ)!�But God, Glorified and Exalted is He, knows best.His words:"
