  "text": "O man! Verily you are toiling laboriously toward your Lord\ufffdThat is, you are striving towards your Lord through your works with great effort, \ufffdand will encounter Him, by your effort; so look upon your effort: does it merit Paradise and proximity with Him, or Hellfire and alienation from Him?Once ʿUmāra b. Zādhān said, \ufffd[Abū ʿAbd Allāh] Kahmas said to me in a whisper, \ufffdO Abū Salma, I committed a sin which I have been crying over for forty years now.\ufffd I asked him, \ufffdWhat is that, O Abū ʿAbd Allāh?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdOnce a brother of mine visited me and I bought him a grilled fish for a small coin. After he had finished eating, I got up [and went] over to the wall of my neighbour and took a piece of earth from it with which he proceeded to clean his hands. Consequently, I have been crying over that for forty years.\ufffd\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
