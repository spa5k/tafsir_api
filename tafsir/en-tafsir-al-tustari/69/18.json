Did you not ask Me to marry you to such and such a bondswoman of Mine who was better than you and We married you to her? This is His questioning concerning the blessings He has bestowed upon you. So, how about His interrogation concerning the acts of transgression against Him?The saying has been related from ʿUtba al-Ghulām, \ufffdTruly, the believing servant will be kept standing before God, Exalted is He, a hundred years for one sin.\ufffdHis words, Exalted is He:"
