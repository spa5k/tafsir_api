It has been mentioned in a ḥadīth that on the Day of Reckoning, tables spread with food will be placed before those believers who devoted themselves to fasting (ṣawwām), from which they will eat. [Others] will say, \ufffdO Lord, people are standing for the Reckoning who are not eating.\ufffd They will be told, \ufffd[These people] used to fast at length during the life of the world, while you ate your fill, and they would stay up at night in prayer while you took your rest.\ufffd"
