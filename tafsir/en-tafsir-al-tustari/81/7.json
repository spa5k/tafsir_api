The disbeliever (kāfir) and the devil (shayṭān) will be coupled together with a single chain. In this verse there is a cautioning against taking evil companions (quranāʾ al-sūʾ).Sahl said:The natural self and spiritual self will be joined together and will be mingled in [their partaking of] the bliss of Paradise inasmuch as they were allied in this world in keeping remembrance constantly (idāmat al-dhikr) and upholding a state of gratitude (iqāmat al-shukr). His words, Exalted is He:"
