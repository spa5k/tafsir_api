  "text": "and you see people entering God\ufffds religion in throngs,and you see people, the people of Yemen, entering God\ufffds religion in throngs, in multitudes (zumaran) \ufffd the tribe with its families, and the whole people. So, help your spirit (rūḥ) against your lower self (nafs) by preparing for the Hereafter, for it [the spirit] comes from it. The lower self desires the world because it comes from that, but the spirit desires the Hereafter because it comes from that. Gain ascendancy over the lower self and open for it the door to the Hereafter by glorifying [God] (tasbīḥ) and seeking forgiveness for your nation. From then on, he [the Prophet  would seek forgiveness and glorify God] a hundred times in the morning and a hundred times in the evening. Furthermore, he would strive in worship night and day to the point where his feet swelled up, his eyes became red, and his cheeks became pale. He would smile little and weep and ponder a lot.It has been narrated from Ibn ʿAbbās y that he said, \ufffdWhen this sūra was revealed, the Companionsof the Prophet  were gladdened by it, but Abū Bakr wept profusely. So the Messenger of God  asked him \ufffdWhat makes you weep?\ufffd He said, \ufffdThe parting of your soul has been announced for you O Messenger of God.\ufffd The Prophet  said to him, \ufffdYou have spoken the truth.\ufffd Then he said: \ufffdO God, grant him understanding of the religion, and teach him [the science of] interpretation (taʾwīl).\ufffd This is also a teaching in religion and glorification for his nation. Indeed Rabīʿ b. Khaythum  said, \ufffdReduce your speech except in nine [areas]: [in saying],\ufffdGlory be to God!\ufffd, \ufffdPraise be to God!\ufffd, \ufffdThere is no god except God\ufffd, \ufffdGod is Great\ufffd, and in the recitation of the Qurʾān, commanding what is right, forbidding what is wrong, asking for goodness and seeking refuge from evil.\ufffd"
