      "text": "The hypocrites try to deceive God, but it is He who causes them to be deceived�This means that He hastens the recompense for their [outwardly] showing faith, and [inwardly] keeping secret their disbelief, by withdrawing His protection and grace from them, and by augmenting their wealth and offspring, and granting them access to the immediate [pleasures of] this world. But, their final destination is the Fire. This is what is meant by His words, [Thehypocrites] try to deceive God, but it is He who causes them to be deceived. He meant by this the speed of delivering their recompense (jazāʾ) for what they perform and abstain from. This is as His saying, Nay, but you marvel while they engage in ridicule [37:12], by which He meant that He hastened their punishment for their persisting in denial [of the truth]. Thus were His words addressed in accordance with the name of their action. And indeed in [other] places He describes their being in a state of wonder (ʿajab); [for example,] in His words, [Say, �It has been revealed to me that a company of jinn listened and said], �We have heard a wondrous Qurʾān�� [72:1]; and in Sūra Qāf, Nay, but they [the disbelievers] think it strange [50:2]; and in Sūra Ṣād: What an astonishing thing! [38:5]. So also [wonder] is mentioned in Sūra Ṣāffāt: Nay but you marvel while they engage in ridicule [37:12], that is, you see their recompense as immense (ʿaẓīm), And here He calls the immense recompense a marvel, for the one who marvels at something that has reached its utmost degree, and this is what is meant in His words, you marvel.It has been related that Shaqīq read [the Qurʾānic words] to Sharīḥ as �I marvel (ʿajibtu)� to which Sharīḥ replied, �[It should be] you marvel (ʿajibta)�, for truly God does not marvel at anything. The only one who marvels is one who does not know.� Then Shaqīq said, �I informed Ibrāhīm of this, and he said, �For sure, Sharīḥ is pleased with his own knowledge. However, Ibn Masʿūd is more knowledgeable than him and he used to read it, I marvel with a ḍamma (ʿajibtu�When they stand up to pray they do so lazily�This is one of the signs of the hypocrites, and by this they betray the trust (amāna), which outwardlythey appear to have taken upon themselves."

One who is obedient(muṭīʿ) is wary of ostentation (riyāʾ) and persists in remembrance (dhikr). The one who is constant in remembrance (dhākir) is wary of conceit (ʿujb), and imposes upon himself [the sense of] his own deficiency (taqṣīr).[Concerning this verse] he also said:God most High revealed to David , �The wailing of sinners is more beloved to Me than the clamour of the veracious (surākh al-ṣiddīqūn)�.

However, the ruin of religion and this world comes from three things: ignorance (jahl), folly (khurq) and laziness (kasal).On another occasion, I heard him say:There are four things which are among the buttresses (daʿāʾim) of the religion: to uphold the truth even against your own self and others; to renounce falsehood in yourself or others; to love the people who are obedient to God and to detest those who disobey Him.He was asked about His words, Exalted is He:"

(tawakkul)?� He replied:Trust is the submission of the body in servanthood, the attachment of the heart to the divine lordliness (rubūbiyya) and the disclaiming of all power (ḥawl) and strength (quwwa).Then he was asked: �What is the reality (ḥaqīqa) of trust (tawakkul) in principle?� He replied:At its root, the reality of trust is the realisation of God�s oneness (tawḥīd), while its branch is the knowledge of the Last Day [lit. knowledge of the Hour] (ilm al-sāʿa); and through tranquil repose (sukūn) in it [trust] there is visual beholding (muʿāyana).Then he said:Do not be anxious about trust, for truly it is a means of livelihood for those who possess it.He was asked, �Who are those who possess it?� He replied:They are those who have been privileged with a special quality.Sahl was asked to clarify this further, and he said:Truly all the sciences are the lowest categories of worship (taʿabbud). The sum of all worship is only the lowest category of scrupulous piety (waraʿ). The sum of all renunciation (zuhd) is the lowest category of the manifestation of divine omnipotence (ẓuhūr al-qudra). Furthermore, the divine omnipotence does not become apparent to anyone except the one who has complete trust (mutawakkil). Trust is not susceptible of any categorical definition, nor does it have a limit that would make it susceptible of comparison, nor does it have an utmost degree that can be reached.Then he was asked, �Describe something of it to us� and he replied:Trust has a thousand ranks, the first of which is the ability to walk on air. He was then asked, �How does the servant reach that level?� He answered:The first thing is gnosis (maʿrifa), then affirmation (iqrār), then the realisation of God�s oneness (tawḥīd), then submission (islām), then the excellence in faith (iḥsān), then the committing of one�s affairs [to God] (tafwīḍ), then trust (tawakkul), and finally the state of tranquil repose (sukūn) in God, Mighty and Majestic is He, in every situation. And he added:Trust is not acceptable from anyone except one who is mindful of God (muttaqī).He was asked, �What is mindfulness of God?� He replied:It is to refrain from all harm [to others] (adhā).
