  "text": "He has put at your disposal all that is in the heavens and the earth, [as a gift] from Him\ufffdHe said:When the heart of the servant finds tranquil repose (sukūn) in its Master, the state of the servantbecomes strong. Subsequently everything is subjected to him, and indeed everything is on intimate terms with him, even the birds and the beasts.It was related of al-Thawrī that he said, \ufffdI set off with Shaybān al-Rāʿī towards Mecca and on the way a lion appeared before us, so I said, \ufffdO Shaybān, do you not see this dog?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdDo not fear! It\ufffds only that the lion heard the speech of Shaybān al-Rāʿī so he started to wag his tail.\ufffd Then Shaybān approached him and proceeded to take hold of his ear and twist it. Then I said, \ufffdO Shaybān what is this fame you have?\ufffd He answered, \ufffdAnd what sort of fame is it that you see, O Thawrī? I swear by God that if it wasn\ufffdt for the fear of fame I wouldn\ufffdt have carried my provisions for the journey to Mecca other than [loaded] on its back.\ufffd Shaybān was on his way to the Friday prayer when he caught sight of a wolf with his sheep, so he said to it, \ufffdSit with the sheep until I return and I will give you a lamb.\ufffd When he returned from the Friday prayer, he found the wolf sitting down looking after the sheep, so he gave him a lamb to take away.\ufffd Sahl used to say to a youth who kept his company, \ufffdIf you are afraid of predatory beasts then do not keep my company.\ufffd And he was asked, \ufffdHow does a man reach the rank of charismatic gifts (karāmāt)? He replied:\ufffdWhoever abstains from (zahada) the world for forty days in veracity and sincerity (ṣādiqan wa mukhliṣan), will have charismatic gifts (karāmāt) manifested to Him from God, Mighty and Majestic is He. But if [such gifts] are not manifested to a person, it is due to the lack of true faith and sincerity in his renunciation\ufffd \ufffd or words to that effect.His words, Exalted is He:"
