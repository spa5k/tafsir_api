      "text": "Whoever has done an atom�s weight of good will see it,He said:When this verse was sent down, the Messenger of God  gave a sermon in which he said, �Nay indeed, this world has an array of goods that are ready to hand which are consumed by the righteous (barr) and the wicked (fājir) alike. Nay indeed, the Hereafter is truly an appointed hour in which the All-powerful King will make the decree. Nay indeed, all of goodness in its entirety is in Paradise. Nay indeed, all of evil, in its entirety is in the Hellfire. So be aware, since you have already been cautioned by God, and know that you will be shown your deeds, Whoever has done an atom�s weight of good will see it,! but whoever has done an atom�s weight of evil will see that. [99:7, 8]� Abū al-Dardāʾ  said, �Perfection in the mindfulness of God (taqwā) is that the servant fears God to the point that he fears Him even concerning a mere atom�s weight, such that he leaves aside some of the things he considers to be legitimate, for fear of the possibility of its being forbidden. This will act as a screen between him and [doing] what is forbidden.� Sahl said:Do not consider any sin to be insignificant, even if it be small, for truly it has been said by some, �There are four things which come after a sin which are more serious that the sin itself: persistence [in sin], rejoicing [at it] (istibshār), deeming it insignificant (istiṣghār) and taking pride in it (iftikhār).�Ibn Masʿūd  said, �The believer sees his sins as if he were at the foot of a mountain that he fears will fall on top on him, whereas the disbeliever sees sin as a fly which alights on his nose. Then he says, �It�s like this�, with a gesture of his hand [as if it will] fly off.�Then Sahl said:O assembly of Muslims! Indeed you have succeeded in professing on your tongue and believing with certainty in your heart that God is One, that there is none like Him, and that there is a Day for you on which He will resurrect you and on which He will question you about the [deedsyou did which were of an] atom�s weight."
