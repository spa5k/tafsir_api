  "text": "By the [Much]-frequented House He said:The outward meaning is in what Muḥammad b. Sawwār related in his chain of transmission from Ibn Masʿūd , who stated that the Prophet  said, \ufffdOn the night I was taken up to the heaven, I saw the Much-frequented House (Bayt Maʿmūr) in the fourth heaven (and it is also related, the seventh). Each day seventy thousand angels make a pilgrimage to it, and never return\ufffd \ufffd to the end of the ḥadīth. In its inner meaning, it refers to the heart; the hearts of mystics are frequented (maʿmūra) by His gnosis (maʿrifa), His love (maḥabba) and intimacy (uns) with Him. It is to this [the mystic\ufffds heart] that the angels make pilgrimage, for it is the House of the Realisation of God\ufffds Oneness (bayt al-tawḥīd).His words, Exalted is He:"
