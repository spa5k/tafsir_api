Rather, He made it especially for the group of people who are [true] worshippers (ʿābidūn). They are those who worship God, Exalted is He, and give their entire being (muhaj) to Him, not for a recompense, nor because of Paradise or Hell, but out of love (ḥubb) [for Him], and taking pride in the fact that He has made them worthy of worshipping Him. But God knows best.His words, Exalted is He:"
