  "text": "And [mention] Job, when he called out to his Lord, \ufffdIndeed, harm has befallen me\ufffd\ufffdHe said:Suffering (ḍurr) is of two kinds: outward suffering (ẓāhir) and inward suffering (bāṭin). The inward kind is a commotion (ḥaraka) and perturbation (iḍṭirāb) [within] the soul (nafs) inresponse to a moving emotional experience (wārid). The outward kind is when [the emotion] that is concealed in a person becomes outwardly apparent. [However], when what is being suffered inwardly settles [within a person, his] exterior becomes still and does not show it, and he patiently endures those pains. But when the interior (bāṭin) becomes unsettled (taḥarraka) under the influence of the [emotional] experience, the person\ufffds exterior will be shaken into weeping and loud cries. His [Job\ufffds] plea to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is that He grant him assistance in finding acceptance (riḍā) in his heart for that experience. This is because as long as the heart is accepting of God\ufffds command, the servant will not be harmed by his outward reaction. Just consider the instance of the Prophet\ufffds weeping . Note that when he  wept on the death of his son Ibrāhīm, he wept for him out of compassion in accordance with his human nature. Yet his physical response did not harm him because his heart was accepting (rāḍin) of it.Sahl used to say to his companions:Say in your supplication (duʿāʾ): \ufffdO my Lord, if you cook me, I\ufffdll bear it and if you roast me, I\ufffdll be happy. It is essential that You be known, so favour me with gnosis (maʿrifa) of You.\ufffdHe was asked about the abode (dār), whether it was an abode of Islam or disbelief. He replied, \ufffdThe abode is the abode of tribulation (balāʾ) and testing (ikhtibār).\ufffd ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Marwazī asked Sahl, \ufffdWhat do you say of a man whose lower self has been calling him to satiate it on the leaves of a lotus tree (sidr) for eighteen days?\ufffd Sahl answered, \ufffdWhat do you say of a man whose lower self has been calling him to let him just catch the scent of the leaves of a lotus tree ⸢for twenty-five days⸣?\ufffd He said, \ufffdʿAbd al-Raḥmān started at this and became indignant.\ufffd His words, Exalted is He:"
