      "text": "So truly with hardship comes ease,He said:God, Exalted is He, has magnified the state of hope (rajāʾ) in this verse out of His generosity (karam) and His hidden grace (khafī luṭfihi), and thus He mentions ease twice. Indeed, the Prophet  said, �Hardship (ʿuṣr) will not overwhelm the two eases.� By this he meant: the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb) and the intellect (ʿaql) are the two �eases� which take control of the natural self, and return it to the state of sincerity (ikhlāṣ). This is [also]the inner meaning of the verse, namely that along with the hardship (shidda) of the natural self (nafsal-ṭabʿ), in its need for God Himself (dhāt al-Ḥaqq), Mighty and Majestic is He, [and] for the spiritual self (nafs al-rūḥ), ⸢[there comes] the ease (suhūla) of the spiritual self⸣, the intellect (ʿaql) and the discernment of the heart (fiṭnat al-qalb), and this, in its inner meaning, [signifies]the confident abandonment (taskīn) of the heart of Muḥammad  to the [divine] succour (iʿāna) in fear. So He [God] said, �Truly, We gave ascendancy (sallaṭnā) over your dense natural self, to the subtle [substances] (laṭāʾif) of your spiritual self, intellect, heart and understanding(fahm), all of which pre-existed as a momentous gift (mawhiba jalīla) before the creation appeared by a thousand years, and thus did they subdue the natural self.�"

Its outer meaning is what is obvious.Abū ʿAmr b. ʿAlāʾ related the [following story], saying, �We fled from al-Ḥajjāj to the desert, and lived there for a period of time going from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. One morning I was wandering through some neighbourhoods with a distracted mind, clouded heart and feeling downcast, when suddenly I heard an Arab shaykh [who was] passing by recite the followingverses: [khafīf metre]Impose patience upon your soul and every worry will vanish. For in patience there is a device [to undo every] deceitMaybe the self detests something in which lies relief,Like the releasing of the cords binding a camel.�The shaykh had not even completed the two couplets before I saw a knight calling out from afar, �Al-Ḥajjāj is dead!�� He [Abū ʿAmr] continued, �Then I asked the shaykh about the word �relief� (farja). He replied, �Furja with a ḍamm on the letter fāʾ is an opening in a wall or in the ʿūd or something similar, whereas farja with a fatḥa on the letter fāʾ is relief after hardship and misfortunes.�� Abū ʿAmr then said, �I did not know which I was happier about, the death of al-Ḥajjāj or the lesson from which I had benefitted.�His words, Exalted is He:"
