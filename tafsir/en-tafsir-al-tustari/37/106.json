He said:We have heard that the following is written in the Psalms, \ufffdI did not decree anything for a believer which he either liked or detested without its being good for him.\ufffd And it is related that God, Exalted is He, revealed the following to Abraham , \ufffdThere is no one [whose provision in this world] I have increased, but that I have decreased by the same proportion [his provision] in the Hereafter, and that goes for you also, My true friend.\ufffd Abū Yaʿqūb al-Sūsī relates, \ufffdA faqīr came to us while we were in Arrajān and Sahl b. ʿAbd Allāh happenedto be there also on that day.
