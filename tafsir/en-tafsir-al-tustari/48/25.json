He observes his increase (ziyāda) [in a good state, distinguishing it] from his decline (nuqṣān), and shows gratitude on seeing an increase, but when there is a decline, devotes himself [to remedying it] and makes supplication.It is through these [real believers] that God repels calamity (balāʾ) from the inhabitants of earth. The [true] believer is never lax (mutahāwin) with the slightest shortcoming, for laxity with a little will inevitably lead to [laxity in] a lot.He further said:The servant will not get the taste of faith until he abandons six vices [lit. character traits, khiṣāl]: he should abandon what is forbidden (ḥarām), illegal possessions (suḥut), what is dubious (shubha), ignorance (jahl), intoxicant[s] (muskir) and ostentation (riyāʾ); [on the other hand] he should adhere to [six virtues]: knowledge (ʿilm), putting his actions right (taṣḥīḥ al-ʿamal), integrity of heart (naṣḥ bi\ufffdl-qalb), veracity of the tongue (ṣidq bi\ufffdl-lisān), correct conduct (ṣalāḥ) in associating with people and sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the way he deals with his Lord.He also said:The Book of God is founded upon five [virtues]: veracity (ṣidq), seeking the best [through God\ufffds guidance] (istikhāra), consultation (istishāra), patience (ṣabr) and gratitude (shukr).His words:"
