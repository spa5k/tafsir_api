  "text": "It was He who sent down the spirit of peace (sakīna) into the hearts of the believers\ufffdThat is, profound peace (ṭumaʾnīna). For God first of all discloses to His servants gnosis (maʿārif), then forms of mediation (wasāʾil), then the spirit of peace (sakīna), and lastly intuitive insights (baṣāʾir). And one to whom God discloses intuitive insights, knows things according to their essences (jawāhir), as did Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq  who never erred in speech.His words:And to God belong the forces of the heavens and the earth\ufffdHe said:His forces (junūd) are of different kinds: His forces in heaven are the prophets (anbiyāʾ), and on earth, [His] friends (awliyāʾ). His forces in heaven are hearts (qulūb), and on the earth, souls (nufūs). Whatever God empowers (sallaṭa) over you, [may be counted as being] among His forces. If He empowers your lower self over you, your lower self will itself destroy you; and likewise, if He empowers your bodily members over you, they themselves will destroy you. If your lower self overpowers your heart, it will drive you to the pursuit of desire (hawā). But if your heart overpowers your lower self and your bodily members, it will tether them with propriety (adab), compel them into worship (ʿibāda), and then adorn them with sincerity in servanthood (ikhlāṣ fi\ufffdl-ʿubūdiyya). All of these together amount to God\ufffds forces.His words:"
