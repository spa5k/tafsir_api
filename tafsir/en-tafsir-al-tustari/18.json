The similitude of the Sunna in this world is that of the Garden in the Hereafter. Whoever enters the Garden is safe. Likewise whoever adheres to the Sunna in this world is preserved from all ills. Mālik b. Anas  said, �If a man had committed all the enormities (kabāʾir), but then harboured no desire for any of them nor any innovation, I would be hopeful for him.� Then he said, �Let whoever dies following the Sunna be of good cheer�, three times over.Sahl said:The veils will not be lifted from the servant until he buries his lower self in the earth.He was asked, �How does he bury his lower self?� He replied:He slays it through the Sunna, and also buries it by adhering to the Sunna. This is because every station of the worshippers, such as fear, hope, love, longing, abstinence, contentment and trust, has a limit (ghāya) except for the Sunna, for it has no limit or end.Mattā b. Aḥmad was asked about the meaning of the words: �The Sunna has no limit.� He said, �No one has fear like the fear of the Prophet , and [the same goes for] his love (ḥubb), his longing (shawq), his abstinence (zuhd), his contentment (riḍā), his trust (tawakkul), and his [noble] characteristics (akhlāq). Indeed, God, Exalted is He, has said: Assuredly you possess a magnificent nature [68:4].�He [Sahl] was asked about the meaning of the words of the Prophet , �Make yourselves hungry and denude yourselves.� He replied:Make yourselves hungry for knowledge and denude yourselves of ignorance.His words:"

This is also a commentary on the words of the Prophet, �There is neither power nor strength except in God�, � that is: �There is no means of security against ignorance concerning the principle, or against persistence [in transgression] resulting from that [ignorance], save through Your protection. Likewise, we have no power to perform what You have commanded us in principle (aṣl), nor security in putting that into practice (fī�l-farʿ), nor of a praiseworthy end except through Your aid�.Sahl was asked, �What is the best thing that a servant can be given?� He said:Knowledge by which he increases in his sense of utter neediness (iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He.His words:"
