  "text": "And be patient with what they say, and keep apart from them beautifully. We indeed know that thy breast is straitened by what they say [15:97]. And be patient with beauti- ful patience [70:5]. So be patient, as the possessors of resoluteness among the messengers were pa- tient [46:35]. Be patient with thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in Our eyes [52:48]. In several places in the Qur'an that paragon of the world is commanded to have patience, for patience is the antidote to the poison of trial. The mark of the folk of love and friendship is patience. Patience in tribulation is no great work, for it is indeed people's habit. The manly man is he who is patient in blessings and keeps his feet on the road of servanthood. He does not step out- side of the blessings written for himself. Nimrod, Korah, Pharaoh, Haman, and their likes were drowned in the ocean of destruction only as a result of impatience. In blessings the Adamites have ungratefulness and ingratitude. Their feet do not remain in the blessings; rather, they pass beyond their limit and bring forth impudence and exultation. This is why the Exalted Lord says, “No indeed; surely man is rebellious because he sees himself without needs” [96:6-7]. Hence the final end of their work in this world is this: “How many a city We destroyed who exulted in their delightful life” [28:58]; and in the afterworld, what the Lord of the Worlds says in this surah: “Surely with Us there are shackles and hellfire, choking food and a pain- ful chastisement” [73:12-13]."
