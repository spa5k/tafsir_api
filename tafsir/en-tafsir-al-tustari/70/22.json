They do not repose in anything other than Him and they do not fear anything other than Him, their [only source of] anxiety being the possibility of separation from Him, just as He says, and who are apprehensive of the chastisement of their Lord [70:27].The saying is narrated from the Prophet : \ufffdAccording to what the highest host in the highest ranks informed me, among the best of my nation are people who laugh out loud at the amplitude of the mercy of their Lord, and weep in secret out of fear of the severity of the punishment of their Lord. They remember their Lord morning and night in His blessed houses, and make supplications to Him with their tongues in hope and fear. They petition Him with their hands, lowering [their upturned palms] and raising them, and they long for Him constantly with their hearts. Their demands on people are light, but their demands on themselves heavy. They tread upon the earth [lightly] with their feet, as an ant would tread, without gloating, boasting or swaggering\ufffd\ufffd to the end of the ḥadīth. His words, Exalted is He:"
