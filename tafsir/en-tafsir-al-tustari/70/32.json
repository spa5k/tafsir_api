  "text": "and those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant,He said:Its inner meaning refers to the trust (amāna) within the self, for it is God\ufffds secret with His servants. He confides with them (yusārruhum) due to His knowledge of all the suggestions(khawāṭir) and aspirations (himam) which are within it [the self]. On the other hand, they confide in Him by showing their neediness for Him and seeking refuge in Him.Furthermore, if the heart acquiesces in that which the evil whispering of the Enemy suggests to it, even though it may be the most insignificant thing, it will manifest itself in the breast, and from the breast to the body and thus will he have betrayed God\ufffds trust (amāna), His pledge (ʿahd) and faith (īmān)."
