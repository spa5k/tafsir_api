  "text": "Woe to the defrauders!He said:They are the hypocrites and those who take on their characteristics, stinting in their prayer. Thus did Salmān [al-Fārisī]  say, \ufffdThe prayer is the balance (mikyāl); whoever deals faithfully will be rewarded his due, but as for whoever stints \ufffd you already know what God, Exalted is He, has said concerning the defrauders (muṭaffifūn): Will you bid others to piety and forget yourselves...? [2:44]. You vilify them for the slips they make that are typical of the faults of men, and yet you commit similar misdeeds and those which are more abominable still.\ufffd No one looks upon the slips of [other] people except an ignorant wrongdoer, and no one [may] make known that which he has looked upon [of the faults of others] except God. Indeed it has been related that God spoke to David  through inspiration the words, \ufffdI complain of My servants to you, O David!\ufffd He asked, \ufffdAnd why is that, my Lord?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdIt is because they sin in secret and repent in public, and truly I do not wish anyone to look upon the sin of my servant besides Me.\ufffdʿUmar b. Wāṣil said that he had asked Sahl about God\ufffds words, Nay, on that day they will be veiled from their Lord [83:15]. He replied:In this life they are veiled from the Commander (al-Āmir) and the Restrainer (al-Zājir). Thus it was related in a report, \ufffdHappy is the one whose heart acts for him as an admonisher and whose intellect as a restrainer.\ufffd So if a person wants something from which God is absent, they [the heart and intellect] will hold him back from it. \ufffd [But as for those mentioned in the verse], in the Hereafter they are veiled from the [divine] mercy, and from being able to behold God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and are deprived of His looking upon them with His good pleasure (riḍā) and satisfaction (riḍwān) when He questions them. Just as He has said, But [first] stop them, for they must be questioned [37:24] about [their] religion (diyāna), and they will not be able to shake off the evidence against them, so He will put them into the Hellfire."
