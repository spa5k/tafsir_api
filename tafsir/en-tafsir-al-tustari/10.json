Furthermore He directed them to the right guidance (rushd) for them with His words, And follow what is revealed to you, and be steadfast until God gives judgement, for He is the Best of Judges. To be steadfast in following [what is revealed], is to abandon devisingand self management (tadbīr), for in this [abandonment] there is now [i.e. in this world] deliverance from the vain caprices (ruʿūnāt) of the lower self, and later [i.e. in the next world] salvation from the shame of transgression.His words, Exalted is He:"

The life of the heart is in two things: in its root (aṣl) it is faith (īmān), and in its branch (farʿ) it is sincerity. Sincerity is a matter of great importance and the one who possesses it is wary lest his sincerity should not prevail till death, for actions are [judged] on the ones that come last � Worship your Lord, until what is certain comes to you [15:99].

Those are the true believers [8:4].And he [Sahl] said:All goodness comes together in four things, and through these they [believers] become �Substitutes�(abdāl): an empty stomach, seclusion from people, the night vigil, and observing silence.He was asked why the Substitutes (abdāl) are called Substitutes. He answered:It is because they substitute their spiritual states (aḥwāl) [one for another]. They have submitted their bodies to the vigour (ḥīl) in their innermost secrets (asrār). Then they move from state (ḥāl) to state, and from knowledge (ʿilm) to knowledge, so that they are constantly increasing in the knowledge of that which is between them and their Lord.He was asked, �Who are more excellent, the Mainstays (awtād) or the Substitutes (abdāl)?� He answered, �The mainstays�. Then he was asked, �And how is that?� He replied:It is because the Mainstays have already arrived and their principles (arkān) are well established, whereas the Substitutes move from state to state.[On this subject] Sahl also said:I have met with one thousand five hundred veracious [servants of God] (ṣiddīq) among whom were forty Substitutes (abdāl) and seven Mainstays (awtād), and I found their way (ṭarīqa) and method (madhhab) to be the same as that which I follow.Furthermore, he used to say, �I am the proof of God (ḥujjat Allāh) against you in particular and against the people in general.�It was [Sahl�s] way and his conduct to be full of gratitude and remember [God] a great deal. He was also constant in observing silence and reflection. He would dispute little and was of a generous spirit. He led people through his good character, mercy and compassion for them, and by giving them good counsel. He held fast to the principle[s] (aṣl) [of religion] while putting into practice [the rules] that are derived from it (farʿ). Truly God filled his heart with light, and invested his speech with wisdom. He was among the best of Substitutes, and if we include him among the Mainstays he was the Axis (quṭb) around which the millstone [of the world] revolves."
