And this is a maxim for sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the profession of God\ufffds oneness(tawḥīd), since the truth (ḥaqīqa) of professing His oneness means looking towards God and none other, advancing towards Him (iqbāl ʿalayhi) and relying upon Him (iʿtimād ʿalayhi). However, this will not be accomplished save by turning away from everything other than Him, showing one\ufffds utter neediness for Him, and taking refuge in Him.His words, Exalted is He:"
