  "text": "Say, \ufffdIt has been revealed to me that a company (nafar) of jinn listened, then said, \ufffdWe have indeed heard a marvellous Qurʾān,He said:They were nine in number and had proceeded from Yemen. The word nafar refers to a number between three and ten. They came to the Prophet  while he was reciting Qurʾān in his prayer. They were among the best of their people in religion, and when they heard it, they were moved by it (raqqū lahu) and they believed in it. Then they returned to their people as warners, and said, \ufffdWe have indeed heard a marvellous Qurʾān,! which guides to rectitude\ufffd [72:1, 2], meaning, \ufffdIt guides [people] to follow the ways of Muṣṭafā \ufffd.Sahl said:Once I saw in the place that was home to the ʿĀd people of old, a city built of stone, within which there was a magnificent palace that that had been carved out of the rock, which was a refuge for the jinn. I entered the palace to reflect [upon it], and I saw a large person standingin prayer facing the Kaʿba, wearing a long white woollen garment (jubba) which had a certain freshness (ṭarāwa) about it. I was impressed with its freshness, so I waited until he had finished his prayer and then I said: \ufffdPeace be upon you.\ufffd He replied: \ufffdAnd upon you be peace, Abū Muḥammad. Were you impressed with the freshness of my garment which has been on me for nine hundred years, and in which I met with Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon them both) and Muḥammad , and believed in them both? Know, O Abū Muḥammad, that bodies [in themselves] do not wear out clothes, but rather, illegitimate sources of food, and persistencein committing sins.\ufffdThen I asked, \ufffdWho are you?\ufffd He replied, \ufffdI am one of those concerning whom God, Exalted is He, said, Say, \ufffdIt has been revealed to me that a company of jinn listened\ufffd\ufffdSahl was then asked, \ufffdDo the jinn enter Paradise?\ufffd He replied:I have heard that in Paradise there are lands which the jinn inhabit, and where they eat and drink, and in the Qurʾān there is evidence of this as God said, Exalted is He: [of modest gaze] who have not been touched by man or jinn before [55:56].His words, Exalted is He:"
