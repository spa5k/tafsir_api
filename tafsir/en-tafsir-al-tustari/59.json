Let whoever has the ability fulfil what he owes to his self and what he owes to the knowledge which is between him and his Lord, by considering well the outcome of his affairs.It was related of Ḥasan that he said, �When a son of Adam [i.e. a human being] dies, the children of Adam [the other human beings] ask, �What has he left behind?� But the angels ask, �What has he sent ahead?� His words:"

God [makes them forget] to apologise (iʿtidhār) and seek repentance (tawba).He said:Any servant who sins and does not repent, [will find] that sin leading him on to another sin, which will cause him to forget the former sin. On the other hand, any servant who does a gooddeed [will find] that leading him to another good deed, upon which his intellect will perceive the deficiency of the former good deed, so that he may repent for the deficiency in his past good deeds, even if they were pure and sound.His words, Exalted is He:"

And the hands of the believers, that is, despite being side by side with the believers, witnessing them and sitting with them, they were deprived of their blessings. So take heed, O you who have eyes, that God leads astray whomever He will [35:8], through abandonment (khidhlān), and guides whomever He will [35:8], through His assistance (maʿūna), and you have no influence in the matter.His words, Exalted is He:"

He then said:Impose upon yourselves three things, for the best of [all] that is in this world and the Hereafter is contained within them: keeping [your self] close to [lit. making it consort with, suḥbatuhā] His commandments and prohibitions by adherence to the Sunna; establishing within it the attestation of God�s oneness, which [brings about] certainty (yaqīn), [and imposing upon it] knowledge (ʿilm), through which the spirit attains union (fīhi ittiṣāl al-rūḥ). The one who possessesthese three [traits] is more knowledgeable about what is in the earth�s core than about what is on its surface, and he regards the Hereafter more than he regards this world. Furthermore, he is better known to the angels in heaven than he is on earth to his own family and relatives.He was asked: �What is the knowledge through which the spirit attains union?� [He replied]:It is the knowledge that God is taking care of it, and being contented [with that].

The Arabs say a person is makhṣūṣ when he is poor (faqīr). Thus they gave preference to the good pleasure of God over their own desires. The act of giving preference to others over yourself (īthār) is the testimony (shāhid) of love.The saying has been related from Wuhayb b. al-Ward: �God, Exalted is He, says, �By My might, greatness and majesty, there is no servant who gives preference to My desire over his own desire, without My decreasing his worries, returning to him what he has lost, removing want from his heart, placing richness before his eyes, and trading in his interest through every trader. And by My might and majesty, there is no servant who gives preference to his own desire over My desire, without My increasing his worries, keeping him at a distance from what he has lost, removing richness from his heart and placing poverty before his eyes, and then I care not in which valley he may perish.�� His words, Exalted is He:�Whoever is saved from the avarice (shuḥḥ) of his own soul � they are the successful.He said:That is, he who is saved from the covetousness (ḥirṣ) of his self and its miserliness (bakhl) in everything except God and His remembrance, will abide with God, enjoying a good life, a good life.His words, Exalted is He:"
