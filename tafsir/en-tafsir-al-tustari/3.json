He replied:The purpose of these bodies is in the �deposits� (waḍāʾiʿ) that God has placed within them, by which He puts His creatures to the test. Among [these deposits] is one from which the obedient(ṭāʾiʿūn) should draw admonitory lessons, namely, disbelief (kufr). [On the other hand], there are those which are proof against the heedless (ghāfilūn), namely, gnosis (maʿrifa) and affirmation (taṣdīq) through speech and actions, just as He has said, And He appointed darknessesand light [6:1]. The inner meaning of this verse is that light is knowledge (ʿilm) and darkness is ignorance (jahl), in accordance with His words, And he whom God has not granted any light has no light [24:40], that is, the heart [of such a person] has not [the light] by which to perceive faith in God. The light of faith is one of the greatest blessings (minan) of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and tokens of His generosity (karāmāt). The second [blessing] is the �good word� which is referred to in His words, Exalted is He, Come now to a word that is agreed upon between us and you [3:64]. The third [great blessing] is obedience (iṭāʿa) that the bodily members carry out purely for God�s sake, as when the prayers are maintained and obligatory alms (zakāt) are paid [in a spirit of] satisfaction (qunūʿ) and contentment (riḍā). Thus, [in this latter verse] He summoned them to the best speech, and the most excellent actions. If it had not been for faith in God and the Qurʾān, which is the knowledge of God, and which contains a call [for people] to affirm His lordship and to serve Him in fear, then the prophets, upon whom be blessings and peace, would not have known who among the people had responded to them.His words:"

He said:It was the complacency that they felt because of their great numbers on the day of Ḥunayn and the glory they had gained on the Day of Badr. This was due to Satan coming to associatewith them, after [he saw] the acquiescence (musākana) of their hearts, and their regard for themselves, because of the complacency (iʿjāb) that their own lower selves had seduced them into. So God lifted His protection (ʿiṣma) from them as a punishment. Indeed, when the Prophet  heard his Companions say on the Day of Ḥunayn, �We shall not be overcome by so few�, he warned them, �Do not wish to encounter the enemy, rather ask for safety (ʿāfiya) from God, Exalted is He�, from dependency on your own devising (tadbīr) in any situation, and from [being unaware of your] neediness (dūn al-iftiqār) for God, Mighty and Majestic is He.See how when David  asked his Lord to join him with the ranks of Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, He replied, �You are not on that level, O David.� He asked, �Why is that O Lord?�, to which God replied, �Because I tested them and they showed patience. Furthermore, they did not know the world and the world did not know them. But you have known the world and it has known you, and you adopted it as your kin.� David  said, �Show me one from among your servants who, if You tested him, would show patience.� Then God, Mighty and Majestic is He, said, �I�m going to test you.� Thus he [David] became the first to request affliction (balāʾ), ⸢and the one who exposed himself to⸣ testing (imtiḥān) from God, Exalted is He. That is to say, this was [of course] in accordance with God�s prior knowledge in the veiled unseen, which is solely known to Him. Then Iblīs came to him in the form of a pigeon and the story took place involving Uriah b. Ḥanān. God did not protect [David] from desire, intent or action. However, He protectedJoseph from action, though He did not protect him from desire and intent. His words:"

So pardon them, that is, �Overlook their faults�, and ask forgiveness for them, for their defeat on the Day of Uḥud. Consult them in the matter, that is, �Do not distance them from yourself because of their disobedience, but accommodate them through your graciousness (faḍl), for it is through Us that you pardon, through Us that you seek forgiveness, and to Us that you turn for guidance�. Then, when you are resolved, that is, �If you wish to carry something out after consultation�, put your trust in God�, that is, �Rely on God notwithstanding that [consultation], consign all your affairs to Him, and depend on Him without regard for anyone else.� He [the Prophet] did not leave this world before God, Exalted is He, had disclosed to his heart realms of knowledge which were between him and God, Exalted is He, without any intermediary, due to his love of pondering and reflection, in reverent awareness (iʿtibār) of the omnipotence of his Lord, so that he attained an increase from God most High, just as He was commanded in the words of God, Exalted is He, But say: �My Lord! Increase me in knowledge� [20:114]. Furthermore, he enjoined this upon his nation (umma), as is related from the Prophet  in his words, �Consult those who are mindful of God (muttaqūn), who have preferred the Hereafter over this world, and who give you priority over themselves in your affairs.� And he also said, �Consult the righteous scholars, and when you have made your resolve to carry something out, put your trust in God.�He [Sahl] said [in this regard]:Fraternise with brothers among the people who are mindful of God, and let the person whom you consult be one of those who fear God, Exalted is He.

As for abandonment itself (tark), that is for the sinner who recognises his sin. Being forsaken (khidhlān), however, is for the one who sins while believing that he is doing something good. This is God�s punishment to the one who is forsaken, for He upholds him in sin, having the knowledge both of his sin and of his subsequent procrastination of repentance. Do you not see how Iblīs, when he refused [to obey], and persisted in that refusal was forsaken by God due to His prior knowledge about him? This is because He willed from him that which was in accordance with His knowledge; He did not will from him that which was in accordance with His command. However Adam , because he was not forsaken in his abandonment, confessed to his sin after committing it and returned to his Lord, Majestic and Mighty is He, and his repentance was accepted.His words, Exalted is He:"

I asked him, �Do you have a Lord?� to which he replied, �Is the likes of me questioned about his Lord?� So I said to him, �If you have a Creator as you claim, why do you work with wood?� Then the man indicated to the sky, and lo and behold, the wood became gold!

He asked them, �What has brought you to this state I see you in?� They said, �The fear (khawf) of our Creator and wariness (ḥadhr) of punishment for our disobedience.� He responded, �God made it incumbent upon Himself to grant safety to the one who fears [Him].� Then he moved on until he came to three other people who were even more emaciated. He asked them, �What has brought you to this state I see you in?� They answered, �The yearning (shawq) for our Lord.� He replied, �God made it incumbent upon Himself to grant you what you wish for.� Then he moved on until he came to three people who were even more emaciated, whose faces were like full moons. He asked, �What has brought you to this state I see you in?� They replied: �Love (ḥubb).� He said, �You are the people of proximity [with God] (muqarrabūn)�, and he said it thrice. Thus, whoever loves God, Exalted is He, is one of the people of proximity [with God], for if anyone loves something they hasten towards it.So the first level is the rank of the repentant (tawwābūn); the second is that of the people of longing (mushtāqūn), and then the servant reaches the third rank which is that of love. Do you not see how they gave their all for the sake of the One who possesses all, turned their backs on all, and faced the direction of the One who possesses all?[Concerning] His words:"

However inwardly it implies the Messenger. The one who believes in him [the Messenger] is the one in whose heart God has made firm the profession of His oneness (tawḥīd). His words:"
