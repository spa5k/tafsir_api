Thus, to the one who contemplates the Creator through the creation, the wonders of the creation will become apparent. But to the one who contemplates the creation through the Creator, the traces of His omnipotence, the lights of His wisdom and the extent and profundity (balīgh) of His workmanship (ṣanʿa) will be unveiled.His words, Exalted is He:"
