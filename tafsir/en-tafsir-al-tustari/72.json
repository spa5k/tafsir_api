The word nafar refers to a number between three and ten. They came to the Prophet  while he was reciting Qurʾān in his prayer. They were among the best of their people in religion, and when they heard it, they were moved by it (raqqū lahu) and they believed in it. Then they returned to their people as warners, and said, �We have indeed heard a marvellous Qurʾān,! which guides to rectitude� [72:1, 2], meaning, �It guides [people] to follow the ways of Muṣṭafā �.Sahl said:Once I saw in the place that was home to the ʿĀd people of old, a city built of stone, within which there was a magnificent palace that that had been carved out of the rock, which was a refuge for the jinn. I entered the palace to reflect [upon it], and I saw a large person standingin prayer facing the Kaʿba, wearing a long white woollen garment (jubba) which had a certain freshness (ṭarāwa) about it. I was impressed with its freshness, so I waited until he had finished his prayer and then I said: �Peace be upon you.� He replied: �And upon you be peace, Abū Muḥammad. Were you impressed with the freshness of my garment which has been on me for nine hundred years, and in which I met with Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon them both) and Muḥammad , and believed in them both? Know, O Abū Muḥammad, that bodies [in themselves] do not wear out clothes, but rather, illegitimate sources of food, and persistencein committing sins.�Then I asked, �Who are you?� He replied, �I am one of those concerning whom God, Exalted is He, said, Say, �It has been revealed to me that a company of jinn listened��Sahl was then asked, �Do the jinn enter Paradise?� He replied:I have heard that in Paradise there are lands which the jinn inhabit, and where they eat and drink, and in the Qurʾān there is evidence of this as God said, Exalted is He: [of modest gaze] who have not been touched by man or jinn before [55:56].His words, Exalted is He:"

And this is a maxim for sincerity (ikhlāṣ) in the profession of God�s oneness(tawḥīd), since the truth (ḥaqīqa) of professing His oneness means looking towards God and none other, advancing towards Him (iqbāl ʿalayhi) and relying upon Him (iʿtimād ʿalayhi). However, this will not be accomplished save by turning away from everything other than Him, showing one�s utter neediness for Him, and taking refuge in Him.His words, Exalted is He:"
