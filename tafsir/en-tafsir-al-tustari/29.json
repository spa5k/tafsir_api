Truly affliction is a doorway between the people of gnosis (ahl al-maʿrifa) and God, Mighty and Majestic is He. It has been related that the angels say, �O Lord! Your disbelieving servant has had [the goods of] this world made available to him in abundance, while affliction has been kept away from him.� Then He says to the angels, �Reveal his [the unbelieving servant�s] punishment to them [the other angels?].� When they see it they say, �What he gets from the world is not a blessing for him.� Then they say, �O Lord! You keep the world away from Your believing servant and expose him to affliction!� And He says to the angels, �Reveal to the others his [the believing servant�s] reward.� When they see his reward they say, �Whatever he suffers in this world will not harm him.� He [Tustarī] said:Let your prayer (ṣalāt) be forbearance (ṣabr) in the face of suffering (baʾsāʾ), your fasting (ṣawm) be to observe silence (ṣamt), and your charity (ṣadaqa) be to refrain from doing harm [to anybody] (kaff al-adhā). Furthermore, forbearance in [times of] well-being (ʿāfiya) is more difficult than forbearance in [times of] affliction (balāʾ). This saying is also related from him:Seeking safety (salāma) is not exposing yourself to affliction.His words:"

It was related of Jesus son of Mary  that he said, �Truly I say to you, neither do you want the world, nor the Hereafter.� They said, �Please explain that to us, O prophet of God, for we previouslythought that we only wanted one of them.� He said, �If you obey the Lord of the world, in whose hands are the keys to its coffers, He will give it to you. Likewise, if you obey the Lord of the Hereafter He will give it to you. However, neither do you want the latter nor the former.� His words, Exalted is He:"

However, it is only His elect (khāṣṣa) who fully understand them. Thus, knowledge is rare and understanding granted by God (fiqh ʿan Allāh) even rarer. Whoever becomes acquainted with the knowledge ⸢of Him through the knowledge [acquired by]⸣ his natural self (bi-ʿilm nafsihi al-ṭabīʿiyya), will experience Him in a delusory manner. But regarding the one who becomes acquainted with [God] through the knowledge of God, God knows what He willed from him for Himself (fa�Llāhu ʿarafa murādahu minhu li-nafsihi). The creature has no knowledge of God beyond that. This allusion (ishāra) [to similitudes in the verse] was made due to the fact that their hearts are truly far away from knowledge [of God]. Take note of ⸢his words,  �If you knew God with a true knowledge of Him (ḥaqq maʿrifatihi) then the mountain would cease to exist by [the power of] your supplication�⸣. His words:"
