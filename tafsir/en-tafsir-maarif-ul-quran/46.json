      "text": "Commentary\nوَتَرَ‌ىٰ كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً (\"And you will see every community kneeling down...45:28\" ). The word jathiyah is derived from جُثُو juthuww. It means ` to sit with knees upon the ground'. Sayyidna Sufyan ؓ says that the word means ` to sit in such a way that only the knees and the toes of the feet rest on the ground'. The latter type of sitting will be on account of awe, horror and fear. The words, كُلُّ أُمَّةٍ \"every community\" means that horrors of Resurrection will be felt by all on the plain - believers, non-believers, and righteous and unrighteous, all of them. There are other verses and traditions that exclude the Prophets and the righteous from experiencing the horrors of the Plains of Resurrection. The present verse is not in conflict with them. It is possible that the Prophets (علیہم السلام) and the righteous will experience the horrors of the Plains of Resurrection for a short period of time - the period of time will be so short as if it never existed. It is also possible that the word hull is not used in the sense of \"every\" but in the sense of ` most' - as is used occasionally. From this point of view, the phrase would mean not all the people on the Plain of Resurrection but ` most people' will experience horror, thus the prophets and the righteous are excluded. Some of the scholars take the position that the word jathiyah means ` to sit like the sitting posture in salah'. If this be taken for granted, the difficulty automatically disappears because such a sitting is not out of fear or horror. It is out of respect and honour.\nكُلُّ أُمَّةٍ تُدْعَىٰ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِهَا ...Every community will be called to its book (of record)...45:28\". The word kitab, according to most commentators, refers to ` book of record' which the angels have been writing in the world. The record-books will be thrown on the Plains of Resurrection and each one will receive his respective record-book and it will be said to him: \"Read your book. This day you yourself are enough to take your own account. (17:14) \" The phrase ` Calling towards the record-books' purports to say that they will have to render an account of their deeds before Allah in the next life.\nAlhamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Aljathiyah\nEnds here"

(26: 197)\nThe gist is that these ignorant Jews and Christians who deny the messenger-ship of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and disbelieve the Qur'an are ignorant of their own books, because many scholars of Bani Isra'il having found the prophethood of the Holy Prophet t- and its signs mentioned in their books and having witnessed those signs, have come to believe in him. Even the testimony of their own scholars is not enough for these ignorant people.\nVerse 10 of this Sarah states that their falsification of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and their claim about the Qur'an that it is a forgery, is baseless firstly because, as mentioned in verse 8, if anyone lays a false claim to prophethood, he has to be eliminated by the divine punishment right in this world, so that the common people may be saved from his fraudulent claims, Secondly, if they do not accept this argument, they should, at least, not overlook the possibility that if his claim is correct, and this book is actually from Allah Ta’ ala, and they continue to persist in their arrogance, denial and disbelief, specially when one of their own learned scholar from Bani Isra'il testifies the Book to be from Allah, and comes to believe in it, then what will be their end and how severe a punishment will they deserve?\nThis verse does not name any particular scholar of Bani Isra'iil, nor does it specify whether the testimony had already been given before this verse was revealed, or it would come afterwards. It, in effect, sounds a warning that should such a situation have already arisen or if it should arise in future, one should worry about saving one's skin. Therefore, understanding this verse is not dependent upon the determination of a particular testifier; rather all the Jews and Christians who embraced Islam, of which Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Salam ؓ is more prominent, are included herein, although he embraced Islam in Madinah, while this verse was revealed in Makkah. (Ibn Kathir)\nThe statement by Sayyidna Sa'd ؓ reported in some narrations of Bukhari, Muslim and Nasa'i, that this verse was revealed about Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Salam ؓ and the same statement from Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Mujahid , Dahhak, Qatadah , etc. is not against this verse being Makki, as in this case, it will be a prophecy for the future.

An arrogant person considers his own opinions and deeds to be the criteria for determining right and wrong, good and bad. If he does not like anything, no matter how well it is believed to be by others, he considers all those people to be stupid, while he himself is stupid. The arrogance and pride of the infidels was of this very kind, and since they did not like Islamic faith, they used to say about it's lovers that had it been a good thing, they themselves would have been the first to adopt it, and that one should not trust the choice of these poor people.\nIbn Mundhir (رح) etc., have reproduced a narration according to which this verse was revealed about a slave-girl of Sayyidna ` Umar Ibn Khattab ؓ named Zunairah who had embraced Islam when he was still a disbeliever. She used to be beaten up and threatened by him, so that she might give up Islam somehow or the other, and the kuffar of Quraish used to say that had Islamic faith been a good thing, such a worthless woman as Zunairah would not have preceded us in embracing it.

Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) came before him as a messenger, and Torah was revealed to him which is accepted by all these Jews and Christians. Secondly, it supports the verse 10 above, because Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and Torah themselves are witnesses to the Holy Prophet ﷺ being the messenger of Allah and the Qur'an being Allah's Book."

      "text": "In any case, the real subject of these four verses is to instruct man to behave beautifully with one's parents, and in that context there are other instructions also. Although some narrations of hadith indicate that these verses were revealed about Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، it is obvious that even if any verse of the Qur'an is revealed about any particular person or about any particular incident, the rule laid down thereby remains generally applicable to all. Therefore, even if the verse was revealed about Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، its application is general, regardless of some specifications of age etc., that may appear particular to him.\nوَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ إِحْسَانًا (And We have enjoined upon man to do good to his parents.- 46:15) The word wasiyyah used in the text means 'emphatic order' and ihsan means 'doing good' or 'behaving beautifully' which includes service, obedience, respect and reverence.\nحَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْ‌هًا وَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْ‌هًا (His mother carried him with toil and delivered him with toil.- 46:15) The word كُرْ‌هً kurh means the toil that one has to endure for some reason, while کَرہ karh means the toil one has to undertake under compulsion from someone else. This sentence puts emphasis on the instruction given in the previous sentence for doing good to the parents, and spells out one of the reasons for it. The verse addresses everyone and draws his attention to the fact that parents have gone through hardships and have endured toil for his sake, right from his birth up to his youth. The toil and labor of the mother, specially, is much more prominent. That is why only toil of mother has been stated here by reminding that she carries the baby inside her womb during pregnancy of nine long months, during which she had to bear all kinds of hardship and suffering, and then she endures extreme pain during delivery.\nMother has more rights than father\nAlthough the first part of this verse is a command to do good to both the parents, the second sentence refers only to the hardships suffered by the mother, because they are unavoidable, and no child can be born without them. Every mother has to go through the problems of pregnancy and severe pains of delivery. As against this, it is not necessary for a father that he suffers any hardship in bringing up and educating the child, if he can afford to pay somebody else for these services. That is why the Holy Prophet ﷺ has given more rights to the mother than anybody else. According to ahadith, He has said,\nصِل اُمَّکَ ثُمَّ اُمَّکَ ثُمَّ اُمَّکَ ثُمَّ اَبَاکَ ثُمَّ اَدنَاکَ فَاَدنَاکَ\n\"Do good to and serve your mother, then your mother, then your\nmother, then your father, then the near relatives and then those who come after them.\" (Mazhari)\nوَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَالُهُ ثَلَاثُونَ شَهْرً‌ا (And his carrying and his weaning is in thirty months - 46:15). This sentence too describes the hardships suffered by mother for her baby. It points out that even after suffering hardships during the pregnancy and the severe labor pains, the mother does not get respite from toils, because the natural food of the infant is in her breasts, and she has to suckle the infant.\nThis verse states that the total period of pregnancy and then of weaning is thirty months, Sayyidna Ali ؓ has deduced from this verse that the minimum period of pregnancy is six months, because the Holy Qur'an has determined the maximum weaning period as two complete years in another verse which says,\nوَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْ‌ضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ\nAnd mothers suckle their children for full two years; it is for one who wants to complete (the period of) suckling. (2: 233)\nThe total period of pregnancy and suckling has been mentioned in the verse under discussion (46:15) as thirty months. If the maximum period of suckling, that is twenty four months according to the verse 2:233 cited above, is deducted from thirty months, the balance is no more than six months which has been taken as the minimum period of pregnancy.\nIt is narrated that during the period of Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ ، a woman gave birth to a child in six months, as against the normal period of nine months, or at least seven months. Sayyidna ` Uthman ` decided this to be the case of an illegitimate birth and gave orders for punishment. When Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ came to know the incident, he advised Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ against the decision, and argued that the minimum period of pregnancy is six months as deduced from the verses mentioned above. Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ accepted his argument and cancelled his order. (Qurtubi)\nThat is why all the jurists of the Ummah are unanimous on the point that the minimum period of pregnancy can be six months, while they differ about the maximum period of pregnancy, because the Holy Qur'an has not given any ruling about it.\nConclusion\nThis verse has defined the minimum period of pregnancy to be six months; a perfect and sound baby cannot be born in a lesser period; the maximum period has not been defined, as it may vary with individuals. Similarly, the maximum period for suckling has been defined to be two years; the minimum period has not been defined, because some women do not produce any milk at all; some have their milk dried up within few months, and some babies are not very fond of mother's milk, or it is harmful for them, and they are fed from other sources.\nDifferent views of Jurists about maximum period of pregnancy and maximum period of suckling\nThe great Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) holds the maximum period of pregnancy to be two years. There are different narrations from Imam Malik (رح) about the maximum period of pregnancy to be four, five or seven years, whereas Imam Shafi'i (رح) holds it to be four years, which is also the view of Imam Ahmad, according to more recognized reports from him. (Mazhari). The maximum suckling period, which governs the rules of fosterage, is two years according to the majority of the jurists. Imam Malik, Shafi'i, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal رحمۃ اللہ علیہم and Abu Yusuf and Muhammad from the Hanafi school, are all unanimous on it, and this is also the dictum of Sayyidna ` Umar and Ibn ` Abbas ؓ from the Noble Companions ؓ . (Ad-Darqutani) Sayyidna ‘Ali and Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ also have the same standpoint. (Ibn Abi Shaibah). Only the great Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) has been quoted as saying that a baby can be suckled up to two years and a half. But the correct meaning of this view according to the majority of the Hanafi school is that if the baby is weak and does not take any food except mother's milk even after attaining the age of two years, then it is permissible to suckle him/her for another six months, because it is agreed by all that feeding the baby with mother's milk after the suckling period is unlawful. However, the prevalent fatwa (religious verdict) of the Hanafi jurists is in accordance with the majority of Imams holding that if a child is suckled after the period of two years, it would not result in creating the relationship of fosterage. Maulana Thanawi (رح) has opined in Bayan-ul-Qur'an that although the fatwa is in accordance with the view of the majority, yet it is better to be careful in arranging marriage of someone who has been suckled within six months after two years, which means that fosterage relationship should be presumed, as a matter of precaution, even if a child is suckled within six months after reaching the age of two years.\nSome exegetes have tried to interpret the verse وَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَالُهُ ثَلَاثُونَ شَهْرً‌ا (And his carrying and his weaning is [ in ] thirty months - 46:15) in a manner that it may support the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) that the suckling period is two years and a half. But it is not correct, because, as stated in Tafsir Mazhari, the noble companions Sayyidna ` Ali and Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ have determined the meaning of this verse that the period of thirty months comprises the minimum period of six months for pregnancy, and twenty-four months for suckling.\nSayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that Qur'an has determined the combined period for pregnancy and suckling to be thirty months without defining each period separately, because if a baby is born in the normal period of nine months, the suckling period of twenty-one months is adequate, and if the baby is born in seven months, then a suckling period of twenty-three months is required, and if a baby is born in six months only, then a suckling period of full two years is required. (Mazhari)\nحَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَبَلَغَ أَرْ‌بَعِينَ سَنَةً (until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years - 46:15). The lexical meaning of the word أَشُدَّ 'ashudd (translated above as 'maturity' ) is 'strength'. The same word used in Surah al-An'am (6:152) has been explained to mean 'the age of puberty'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has explained it to mean reaching the age of eighteen years.\nIn the present verse too, some exegetes have taken the word 'ashudd' to mean \"the age of puberty\", and then they have taken the following words, وَبَلَغَ أَرْ‌بَعِينَ سَنَةً \"and reaches forty years\" as a separate stage in one's life, and not an explanation of 'maturity'. This is the view of Sha` bi and Ibn Zayd رحمۃ اللہ علیہما . But Hasan Basri (رح) has held both the sentences to have the same meaning and 'reaching the age of forty years' to be the explanation of 'attaining maturity'. (Qurtubi) Thus the sequence of the events mentioned in the verse is such that pregnancy has been mentioned first, then the delivery of the child, followed by the suckling period. The reference to the maturity after that means that the child lived, became mature in his physical and mental strength and reached the age of forty years. It was at that point that he was able to turn towards his Creator, and began to pray to Him:\nرَ‌بِّ أَوْزِعْنِي أَنْ أَشْكُرَ‌ نِعْمَتَكَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَيَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَالِحًا تَرْ‌ضَاهُ وَأَصْلِحْ لِي فِي ذُرِّ‌يَّتِي ۖ إِنِّي تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَإِنِّي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\n\"My Lord, grant me that I offer gratitude for the favor You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I do righteous deeds that You like. And grant for my benefit goodness in my progeny. Of course, I repent to you, and truly I am one of those who submit to You.\" (46:15)\nAll this description is given by the Holy Qur'an in past tenses and in a style indicating that this description relates to a particular person and a particular event that had already happened before the verse was revealed. That is why Tafsir Mazhari has opined that all these circumstances relate to Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، which have been mentioned in a general form to induce other Muslims also to act in a similar manner. This view is supported by the narration of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ reproduced by Qurtubi. The gist of this narration is that when the Holy Prophet ﷺ traveled to Syria for trading financed by Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ ، he was twenty years old. Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ was with him, and he was eighteen years old, and had 'reached his maturity' in the words of the Holy Qur'an. He witnessed such qualities of the Holy Prophet ﷺ in that journey that he became his ardent admirer, and started accompanying him everywhere even after returning from that journey. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ reached the age of forty years, and Allah Ta’ ala blessed him with prophethood, Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ was thirty-eight years old, and he became the first adult male to embrace Islam. When he became forty years old, he prayed to Allah as stated in this verse above; hence the words of the Holy Qur'an: 'and reached forty years'. Allah Ta’ ala accepted his supplication and gave him 'taufiq' (ability and willingness) to purchase and then set free nine slaves who had embraced Islam and were being tortured mercilessly by their masters\nSimilarly his prayer \"Grant for my benefit goodness in my progeny\" was also accepted in that all his children embraced Islam. Of all the noble companions, only Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ has the distinction that he himself, his parents and his offspring, all embraced Islam and had the honor of being noble companions of the Holy Prophet ﷺ .\nThe question that arises here is that Abu Quhafah ؓ ، the father of Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، embraced Islam after the conquest of Makkah, while the whole of this Surah is Makki, so how was it appropriate for Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، to mention Allah's blessings upon his parents at that stage when his father had not embraced Islam? One answer is that some exegetes have held these verse to be Madani. Given this view, there is no room for any such question. But if the verse is taken to have been revealed in Makkah, the inclusion of his parents in this supplication of Abu Bakr ؓ was by way of praying that they should be blessed by Allah with Islam. (Ruh-ul-Ma’ ani) (1)\n[ 1] In order to understand this, one should recapitulate the words of the prayer under discussion. These are: \"My Lord, grant me that I offer gratitude for the favor You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents.\" According to this explanation, the 'favor bestowed' on the parents of Abu Bakr ؓ would mean the mundane benefits they were enjoying. Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ prayed that they should be granted taufq to offer gratitude to Allah on these favors by embracing Islam. (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)\nAlthough, according to this explanation, all these descriptions relate to Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، yet the instruction is general for all Muslims that when they reach the age of forty years, their care for the Hereafter should take precedence over all their activities; one ought to repent afresh for the past sins, and take all precautions to save oneself from sins in future, because the experience shows that the ethical manners and habits that one is accustomed to at the age of forty years become permanent in his character, and are not easily changed.\nIt is reported by Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ that the Holy Prophet has said that when a Mu'min reaches the age of forty years, Allah Ta` la becomes lenient in taking account of his deeds; at the age of sixty years Allah gives him taufiq of inabah (frequently turning) towards Himself; at the age of seventy years all heavenly beings start loving him; at the age of eighty years, Allah Ta’ ala lets his virtues stand, and sins erased; and at the age of ninety years, Allah Ta’ ala forgives all his sins - past and future, and authorizes him to plead for the forgiveness of his family members, and in the heavens it is written alongside his name that he is detained by Allah on earth. (Ibn Kathir, Musnad of Ahmad, etc.) It is obvious that all this is about a Mu'min who has lived his life avoiding sins and in accordance with the injunctions of 'Shari` ah'.\nSince Ibn Kathir (رح) has adopted the first explanation, that the verse does not refer to any particular person, like Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ but it is meant for a common people, the specific words, like 'until when he reached his maturity and attained the age of forty years\" are all by way of example, wherein the instruction is being imparted that when one reaches the age of forty years, one should have due care for correcting himself and his family members, and his endeavor for the betterment of the Hereafter should take precedence over all his thoughts.

A quotation from Sayyidna ‘Ali ؓ which is given below also indicates that sense of the verse is general.

So, the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، his noble companions\tand Tabi` in رحمۃ اللہ علیہم had made it a habit to avoid worldly enjoyments, as is evident from their lives. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had charged Sayyidna Mu` adh ؓ ، when sending him to Yemen, to keep on avoiding the luxuries of this world.

      "text": "Commentary\nThe previous verses have condemned the infidelity and the arrogant attitude of the infidels and its destructive results. In these verses, the people of Makkah are being put to shame by telling them that even jinn, who are even more proud and haughty than you, had their hearts softened after hearing the Qur'an, and they became Muslims; Allah has given the humans more sense and intelligence than jinns, and despite that they do not embrace faith.\nThe incident of the jinn listening to the Qur'an and then embracing faith is stated in authentic ahadith. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ was blessed with prophethood, the jinns were stopped from listening to the news of the heavens, and if a jinn ventured to go upwards to overhear the heavenly news, was chased away by a meteor directed towards him.\nThe jinns consulted each other to find out the cause of this new phenomenon that has stopped them from listening to the news from the heavens. They believed that some new event happening in the world may have been the cause. In order to discover that event, various groups of jinns spread out in different parts of the world to investigate this phenomenon. One of the groups reached Hijaz also when the Holy Prophet along with some of his companions was present at a place called Batn Nakhlah and was intending to go to the fair of ` Ukaz'. (Arabs used to setup trade-fairs on special days in various places for commercial and social purposes where people of all areas used to assemble, set up shops and arrange meetings and social gatherings much like the exhibitions of our days. One such fair used to be set up in ` Ukaz where the Holy Prophet ﷺ was intending to go probably for preaching and calling towards Islam.) The Holy Prophet ﷺ was leading the morning prayers in Batn nakhlah when the jinns reached there. After hearing the Qur'an, they exclaimed that this was that new matter which has come between them and the heavenly news. (Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, etc., with the authority of Ibn ` Abbas ؓ\nAccording to another narration, when the jinns came there, they directed each other to keep quiet and listen to the Qur'an. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ finished his prayers, they put their belief in Islam, embraced it, went back to their people and informed them of the real cause of the new phenomenon. They also told their people that they had become Muslims and advised them that they should also embrace the faith. But the Holy Prophet ﷺ did not become aware of the jinns coming and going and of their embracing the faith after listening to the Qur'an until Surah jinn was revealed wherein he was informed of this incident. (Ibn-ul-Mundhir quoting ` Abdul Malik)\nAnother narration states that these jinns were inhabitants of Nasibin, either seven or nine in number. When they told their nation about it and motivated them to embrace faith, three hundred of them presented themselves for embracing Islam. (Abu Nu'aim, Al-Waqidi, quoting Ka` b al-Ahbar, as in Ruh-ul-Ma’ ani). There are diverse narrations in other ahadith also, but since they are about various incidents at different times, there is no contradiction between them. That these are different incidents is supported by a statement of Ibn ` Abbas reported by Tabarani in Awsat and by Ibn Marduwaih that the jinns came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ many times.\nKhafaji has said that the cumulative outcome of various ahadith is that jinn presented themselves to the Holy Prophet ﷺ six times for benefiting from his teachings. (Ruh-ul-Ma ani and Bayan-ul-Qur an)"

But there is no clear narration to support this inference. That they did not refer to Injil cannot be a sufficient proof for the jinns being Jews. Another reason for not mentioning Injil may be that Injil follows Torah in most commandments, and the Qur'an, like Torah, is an independent Book, having different commands, rules and regulations. It is likely that the underlying idea was to state that the Qur'an is the Book which is independent like Torah."

The word 'resolute' has been used here as a qualification for all the messengers, and not only for some of them, because the word 'min' used with 'rusul' is not, according to the authentic exegetes, in the sense of 'some'. It is rather for 'Bayan' (description), to use the grammatical term. The sense is that all messengers are resolute people. Of course, variation in the grades of qualities between messengers is proved from the Holy Qur'an itself:\nتِلْكَ الرُّ‌سُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ\nThose are the messengers some of whom We have given excellence over some others (2:253)\nTherefore those prophets who excel other prophets in the quality of being resolute and courageous have been given this title in a special way, although there are differences of opinion as to who they are. Majority opinion is that this special title is given to those prophets who have been mentioned in the following verse of Sarah Al-Ahzab verse 7:\nوَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْ‌يَمَ\nAnd (recall) when We took from the prophets their covenant, and from you and from Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and 'Isa, the son of Maryam. And We did take from them a firm covenant, (33:7)\nSayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ states that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has said \"The delights, luxuries and pleasures of this world do not befit Muhammad ﷺ and his family, because Allah Ta’ ala does not accept anything less than patience from those who are 'resolute', and I have received this divine order: '\"So, 0 prophet, observe patience, as the resolute messengers observed patience. (46:35) \"\nAl-hamdu1i11ah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Alikaf (The Sand-dunes)\nEnds here"

      "text": "Commentary\nوَمَا أَدْرِ‌ي مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي وَلَا بِكُمْ ۖ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ (and I do not know what will be done to me or to you. I do not follow anything but what is revealed to me - 46:9) The sentence, \"I do not follow anything but what is revealed to me,\" has been used here as an 'exception' to the previous sentence, meaning thereby that I do not know anything except what is revealed to me through wahy. The gist of the explanation given to this verse by Imam Dahhak (رح) is that the knowledge of some unseen things can be obtained by the Holy Prophet ﷺ only through wahy, and he does not have any knowledge about those unseen things which were not revealed to him through wahy, be they about his own self, about the believers and disbelievers among his people, or about matters pertaining to this world or to the Hereafter. Whatever the Holy Prophet ﷺ has said about the unseen things is obtained through wahy. The noble Qur'an has declared that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was blessed by the knowledge of innumerable things from the Unseen (ghaib), but all this knowledge was given to him by the divine revelation. This is exactly what the Holy Qur'an means by saying,\nتِلْكَ مِنْ أَنبَاءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَا إِلَيْكَ\n\"These are some reports from the unseen (events) which We reveal to you.\" (11: 49)\nDetails of matters relating to the Hereafter, Hell, Paradise, accountability, reward and punishment are given in the Holy Qur'an itself, and many details of certain future events that had to take place in this world are given in authentic ahadith reported from the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Thus the substance of the present verse is simply that the knowledge of the Holy Prophet ﷺ about the Unseen is not all-encompassing as is that of Allah Almighty, nor is it independently obtained; he simply reproduces whatever Allah Almighty tells him through wahy.\nAfter having reproduced this explanation, the author of Ruh-ul-Ma’ ani says, \"It is my belief that the Holy Prophet ﷺ did not leave this world until he was blessed by wahy with such a knowledge about Allah Ta’ ala, His attributes and about all those things the knowledge of which could be meritorious that no other in the whole universe has ever been blessed with. But I do not believe that unawareness about trivial worldly affairs like the acts of some particular individuals and what they do at their homes and what happens to them one day or the other can in any way reduce his excellence.\"\nDictate of etiquette regarding the knowledge of the Holy Prophet t about unseen matters\nRespect for the Holy Prophet ﷺ demands that one should not say that he did not know the Unseen; rather one should say that Allah Ta` a1a had given such vast knowledge of unseen matters to him as was not given to any other prophet.\nThe explanation given by some exegetes that the negation in this verse is only about the unseen affairs pertaining to this world, and not about the Hereafter (as stated by Qurtubi) is probably because they have not taken the words, \"I do not follow anything but what is revealed to me,\" in the sense of an exception to the previous sentence; hence the negation of the knowledge of unseen things has been made specific to the affairs of this world, because the Holy Prophet ﷺ has told very clearly about the Hereafter that the Mu'min would go to Paradise, and the 'kafir' would go to Hell."
