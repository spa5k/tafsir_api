      "text": "Commentary\nSurah Yunus is among the Makki Surahs. Three of its verses revealed after the Hijrah to Madinah have been called Madani.\nIn this Surah too, the proof of the basic objectives of Qur'an, and Islam, such as the Oneness of Allah, the mission of His Messenger and the inevitability of the Hereafter, has been provided. Since it has been presented in the background of the universe of our experience and observation, it becomes easy to comprehend. Along with it, some lesson-oriented historical accounts and stories have been introduced to warn people who do not pay heed to the open signs of Allah Ta` ala. As a corollary, the text refutes shirk whereby heedless people start ascribing partners to the pristine divinity of Allah - and also answers some related doubts. This is a gist of the subjects taken up in the Surah. A careful look at these will help us understand the interconnection between the previous Surah, At-Taubah, and the present one. Surah At-Taubah was making a strong statement when it opted for breaking through the powerful cordon of kufr and shirk to achieve the same objectives through material means by waging Jihad against deniers and disbelievers. And since the present Surah was revealed in Makkah before the injunctions of Jihad came, these objectives have been explained and proved only by arguments and evidences very much in accordance with the law of the Makkan period.\nThe Surah opens with the letters: Alif, Lam, Ra الر‌). Known as ` isolated letters.' Many Surahs of the Qur'an begin with these. Debates on investigations made into the meaning of letter combinations like الم (Alif, Lam, Mim), حٰمٓ(Ha, Mim) and عٓسٓقٓ(Ain, Sin, Qaf) by commentators are lengthy. But, we also have the authentic verdict of the Sahabah, the Tabi'in and the righteous elders of the community (salaf سَلَف) about these ` isolated letters.' According to them, these are secret symbols or signs. In all likelihood, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was confided with their meaning but he elected to disclose to his community only those areas of knowledge and insight which their minds could bear by and which, if remained unknown, would impede the normal living of his people. Nothing that Muslims must do is dependent upon knowing the secrets of such 'isolated letters,' nor do they have to miss anything by not knowing them. Therefore, the Holy Prophet ﷺ too did not tell his community about their meaning as being unnecessary for them. Therefore, we too should not go about digging into it - because, it is certain that had the knowing of their meaning been expedient for us, our master, who was mercy personified for the whole world, would have never hesitated in telling us about it.\nIn the first verse:\tتِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْكِتَابِ الْحَكِيمِ (These are verses of the Wise Book), the word: تِلکَ\t(tilka: these) points out to the 'ay at of this Surah which follow. 'The Book' refers to the Qur'an. To describe its attribute, the Qur'an has used the word: حَکِیم (hakim) at this place. It means the Book of Wisdom."

      "text": "Some particular states in which the people of Jannah shall find themselves after their arrival there have been spelt out in the fourth verse (10). First of all: دَعْوَاهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ :(their prayer therein will be, \"Pure are you, 0 Allah\" ). Here, the word: دَعوی (da` wa) should not be taken in its well known sense of claim, something a plaintiff does against the responding party. Instead of that, da` wa has been used here in the sense of du'a' (prayer, supplication). It means that the du'a' of the people of Jannah, after they have reached Jannah, will be in the form that they will be saying: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ (Pure are You, 0 Allah), that is, they will be glorifying the exalted majesty of Allah (known as Tasbih in the religious terminology of Islam).\nThis raises a question for du` a', as commonly recognized, is the act of asking for something or the seeking of what one would like to have. The words: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ (subhanaka 'l-lahumma: Pure are You, 0 Allah) have no element of asking or seeking in them. Then, what was the basis of calling it 'du` a'?\nThe answer is that the expression used here is there to communicate something relevant to the great occasion. Is it not that the people of Jannah will have the most comprehensive bliss which will include everything they could wish for almost automatically as they would have wished? So, there will be no asking or seeking. As a replacement of the popular mode of du` a, what they would be able to say would be nothing more than the tasbih of Allah in total submission. That too would not be something like an obligatory act of worship they used to do in their mortal lives (whether or not they enjoyed doing so). In fact, they would savor the taste of saying these words of glorification and say سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ subhanaka 'l-lahumma on their own, gratefully delighted. In addition, reports a Qudsi Hadith that Allah Ta` ala said, ` a servant of Mine who remains busy glorifying Me all the time, so much so that he finds no time even to ask what was to be asked, then, I shall give him the best of what is asked by all those who ask, that is, take care of what he needs to be done without his having to ask for it.' If so, the expression: subhanaka 'l-lahumma that has been translated as ` Pure are You, 0 Allah' could also be called a du` a ' (prayer).\nIt is in terms of this sense that a Hadith in the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to make the following du'a' when in pain or anxiety:\nلا إلہ إلا اللہ اَلعَظِیم اَلحَلِیم، لا إلہ إلا اللہ رَبُّ العَرشِ العَظِیم، لا إلہ إلا اللہ رَبُّ السَمٰوٰتِ و رَبُّ الاَرضِ وَ رَبُّ العَرشِ الکَرِیم\nThere is no god but Allah, the Great, the Forbearing; there is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Great Throne; there is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Earth and the Lord of the Generous Throne.\nImam al-Tabari said: The worthy forbears of the Muslim Community (al-salaf al-salihun) used to call it the prayer of pain (the du` a of karb کَرب ). Whenever in intense pain, anxiety or distress, they would recite these words and pray to Allah for relief. (Tafsir Qurtubi)\nThere is yet another Hadith report carried by Imam Ibn Jarir, Ibn Mundhir and others that the people of Jannah, when they wish to have something, will say سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ subhanaka 'l-lahumma. Hearing this, the angels will instantly present what they wished before them - as if, the words: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ subhanaka 'l-lahumma will serve as a password or access code for the people of Jannah through which they will articulate their wish, and the angels, doing their duty, will fulfill it every time. (Ruh al-M for the people of Jannah through which they will articulate their wish, and the angels, doing their duty, will fulfill it every time. (Ruh al-Ma'ani and Qurtubi) From that angle, we can also call the statement: subhanaka 'l-lahumma, a du'a.\nDescribing the second state of the life of the people of Jannah, it was said: تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَامٌ (and their greeting therein will be \"Salam\" ). In customary usage, تَحِیَّہ (tahiyyah) is the word used to greet someone coming in or met elsewhere, for example ahlan wa sahlan, as the Arabs say, or good morning, good evening, nice to see you, hello, hi as used in English with varying degrees of formality or informality. This verse tells us that the people of Jannah will be greeted with the word: سلام salam from Allah Ta'ala or from the angels. It would mean, ` good news to you that you now stand protected against everything painful or unpleasant.' This 'salam' greeting could also be from Allah Ta'ala Himself as in Surah Ya Sin: سَلَامٌ قَوْلًا مِّن رَّ‌بٍّ رَّ‌حِيمٍ ﴿58﴾ (\"Salam\" [ peace ], a word from a merciful Lord - 36:58). And it could also be from the angels as said elsewhere: وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُم \"and angels will come to them from every gate [ saying ] 'salamun 'alaikum' [ may you be in peace and security ] - 13:23, 24.\" By the way, there is no contradiction in the two sayings. There could be the time when salam greeting comes directly from Allah Ta'ala and there could be the time when it comes from the angels. Though, the salam greeting is actually a du'a (prayer) in the mortal world but, once in Jannah where one would have everything one needs or wishes to have, therefore, this word will not retain its sense of prayer there, instead, will become a complement of glad tidings. (Ruh al Ma’ ani)\nDescribing the third state of the life of the people of Jannah, it was said: آخِرُ‌ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (And the end of their call will be, 'praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds' ).\nThe essential aim of the statement is to indicate that the people of Jannah, once there, will start knowing Allah Ta'ala better. The spiritual master Shahabuddin Suhrawardi, said, 'after having reached Jannah, the people of Jannah as a whole will be blessed with a station of knowledge and wisdom which is occupied by 'Ulama in the mortal world. The 'Ulama would rise to the station the prophets have here. The prophets would rise to the station occupied by Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ the foremost among them in this world.\nAnd he, blessings and peace on him, will occupy the highest station of nearness to Allah in Jannah. It is possible that this may be the celebrated place called ` the praised station' (al-maqam al-mahmud), a place referred to in the du` a' to be recited after adhan where Muslims pray that their Prophet may be blessed with ` the praised station,' a prayer he had himself taught them to make.\nIn short, the initial du` a of the people of Jannah will be: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّـهُمَّ (subhanaka 'l-lahumma: Pure are You, 0 Allah) and the last du` a will be: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (alhamdu li '1-la-hi rabbi 'l alamin: praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds). Pointed to here are two kinds of attributes of Allah Ta` ala. One: The attributes of being the most exalted which show that He is free from and beyond any shortcoming or evil. Two: The attributes of being the noblest which show honor, greatness, magnanimity and perfection. In the last verse of Surah ar-Rahman both kinds have been named by saying: تَبَارَ‌كَ اسْمُ رَ‌بِّكَ ذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَ‌امِ ﴿78﴾ (Blessed is the name of your Lord, the Possessor-par-Excellence of Majesty and Honor - 55:78). If we were to ponder a little, we will see that absolute purity of Allah Ta` ala forms part of His attribute of Majesty. And that He de-serves being praised is one of His attributes of Honor. Since the attributes of Majesty and Honor follow in that order, therefore, the people of Jannah will first recount His Majesty by saying: subhanaka ` llahumma: Pure are You, 0 Allah. Then, they will mention the words: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (alhamdu li 'l-lahi rabbi 'l ` alamin: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds) being a tribute to His Honour, something they are engaged in all the time.\nAnd according to the natural order of these three states, when the people of Jannah will say subhanaka 'l-lahumma, in response to which, they will receive the greeting of salam from Allah Ta` a1a, as a result of which, they will say: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ ' (praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds). (Ruh a1-Ma` ani)\nInjunctions and Rulings\nAl-Qurtubi has said in Ahkam al-Qur'an: According to this conduct of the people of Jannah, Sunnah in eating and drinking, and in everything else we do, is that one starts with Bismillah and ends at Alhamdulillah. The Holy Prophet ﷺ said, It is liked by Allah Ta` ala that His servant, when he eats or drinks something, starts with Bismillah (بسم اللہ) and, when he is finished with it, says Al-hamdulillah' ۔ (الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ )\nIt is recommended (mustahabb) that a person making du'a also says: وَآخِرُ‌ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ and our prayer at the end is that praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds) at the end of it. AI-Qurtubi adds to that by saying: Along with it, it is better to also recite the following last verses of Surah As-Saffat:\nسُبْحَانَ رَ‌بِّكَ رَ‌بِّ الْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ ﴿180﴾ وَسَلَامٌ عَلَى الْمُرْ‌سَلِينَ ﴿181﴾ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ ﴿182﴾\nPure is your Lord, Lord of all might, above from what they ascribe to Him. And salam (peace and security) be on the Messengers. And praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds - 37:180-182."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "Commentary\nThe first of the seven verses cited above relates to people who deny 'Akhirah (Hereafter, life to come). For this reason, when they are warned against the punishment of 'Akhirah, they mockingly say, ` if you are telling the truth, bring this punishment now' or say something like, ` why would this punishment not come soon enough?' This was like what Nadr ibn Harith had said, ` O Allah, if this thing is true, let stones rain down upon us from the heavens, or send some other severe punishment.'\nIt has been answered in the same verse by saying that Allah Ta` ala is, after all, powerful over everything. He can send the promised punishment instantly, right now. But, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, He prefers not to do so. When people like these wish to have evil and hardship sent upon them, they do not realize what they were doing. Had Allah Ta` ala been granting their curses on themselves as soon as they wished - similar to how He would answer their positive prayers fairly often - all of them would have been destroyed to the last man.\nFrom here we learn that it is the customary practice of Allah Ta` ala that He would answer prayers for one's good fairly often and if, on one or the other occasion, a prayer is not answered due to some wise consideration, it would not be contrary to the general rule. But, the case of a person who, because of his ignorance, or anger, or grief, falls into the error of hurling on himself or his family a curse in the fair name of prayer is different. Similar to this is the unfortunate one who invites Divine punishment, due against those who reject the truth of a Here-after, to fall on him, as if playing a game with God. Allah Ta` ala does not accept these prayers promptly, instead, gives them respite so that the denier gets the time to think and abstain from his denial. Or, if the curse has been invoked because of some sudden grief, anger or desperation, then one gets the lease of time to sort out his conduct, avoid what is bad about it and try to stay away from it thereafter.\nIbn Jarir on the authority of Qatadah and al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Mujahid report that, at this place, the invoking of curse refers to what an angry person sometimes does when he breaks into supplicating adversely to the effect that his children, wealth or property be destroyed. Even if the person were to blurt out words of curse on these, it will stand included therein. Allah Ta` ala, in His infinite mercy, does not hasten to answer such prayers. Imam al-Qurtubi, on the authority of a Hadith narrative, reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, ` I have prayed to Allah jalla thana'uh imploring Him not to answer the curse invoked by a friend or relative upon another friend or relative.' Shahr ibn Hawshab says, ` I have read that angels appointed to take care of human needs have been instructed by Allah Ta` ala, in His mercy, that they should not write down what His servant says in grief or anger.' (Qurtubi)\nDespite what has been said here, there are occasions when comes that moment of Divine approval in which what one is saying on the spot gets to be accepted instantly. Therefore, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, ` never pray that evil may fall on your children or things you own - lest, that time be the time the prayer is to be accepted - and the curse so invoked may stand answered (and activated) all of a sudden (causing you remorse afterwards).' This Hadith on the authority of Sayyidna Jabir ؓ appears in the Sahih of Muslim under the event of the battle of Buwat.\nThe outcome of all these Hadith reports is as follows. As obvious, the main address in the verse under reference concerns the deniers of 'Akhirah who demanded an instant punishment. But, in view of its universality, it includes Muslims as well, who may also break into invoking a curse on themselves or on their belongings and children under some fit of grief or anger. Such is the customary practice of Allah Ta` ala, because of His grace and compassion, that he deals with both of them in the same manner. He does not allow such invocations for curses to be actualized and implemented instantly so that the erring person gets the opportunity to think it out and rescind."

      "text": "An eloquent approach has been made in the second verse (12) to convince those who denied that Allah was One (Tauhid) and that there was a life to come ('Akhirah). It was said: When conditions are normal, people would find time to engage in debating the nature and existence of God and the Hereafter. They would feel free to ascribe all sorts of partners and associates to His pristine divinity and look forward to them in the hope that they would respond at their hour of need. But, as soon as some major distress overtakes them, even these very people, disappointed by the entire range of their false gods they pinned their hopes on, do nothing but call Allah for help, not simply once but repeatedly, lying, sitting, standing. They have no choice. They must invoke Him for help. However, along with this attitude, certainly terrible is their ingratitude. When Allah Ta` ala removes their distress, they forget all about Him becoming so disconnected and indifferent to Him as if they had never called Him and never sought His help in their hour of need. This tells us that those who associate anyone or anything else with Allah Ta` ala in His exclusive domain as the Dispenser of all that is needed by His creation do themselves get to experience the demolition of this belief of theirs. But, because of their hostility and obstinacy, they keep glued to their false notion."

It has been said: Let no one miscalculate that punishment cannot come in this world just because Allah Ta` ala gives respite to those who deny and disbelieve. The history of past peoples shows that different kinds of punishments have visited them because of their contumacy and disobedience right here in this world. It is a different matter that Allah Ta` ala has promised that no mass punishment will come upon the Muslim ummah in consideration of the honor of Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ the foremost among prophets. But, it is in the face of this very merciful indulgence of Almighty Allah that people have become audacious enough to come forward and invite, even demand, Divine punishment. On the contrary, it is necessary to remember that indifference to Divine punishment is not proper under any condition even for them (Muslims). The reason is that the promise of not sending mass punishment upon the Muslim ummah, or the world as a whole, certainly stands there, but the coming of such punishment on particular individuals and nations is possible even now."

They were a people who did not know much about God or Revelation or Prophets sent by Him. They took them to be like common human beings having nothing special about them. Think of the Holy Qur'an, which reached the world through the Prophet of Islam. Even this, they thought, was spoken and written by him. It was under this frame of mind that they told the Holy Prophet ﷺ ` as for this Qur'an, it is against our beliefs and ideas.' These idols our forefathers have been worshipping since ever as providers of their needs are, according to the Qur'an, totally false and ineffectual. There are things we have been using and transactions we have been making all along. The Qur'an says that they are all unlawful. And then, the Qur'an tells us that we have to live again after we are dead and that we have to account for everything we have done. All these things make no sense to us. We are not ready to accept them. Therefore, you do one of the two things we are asking you to do. Either you replace this one with another Qur'an which does not have these things, or at the least, amend this very Qur'an and expunge those (undesirable) things from there.'\nRejecting their false notion first, the Qur'an instructs the Holy Prophet a1JI to tell those people that the Qur'an was not his Word, nor could he change it on his own. He only followed what was revealed to him by Allah. If he were to make the least change in it on his own and by his choice, he would be committing a grave sin, and that he feared the punishment that falls upon those who disobey Allah, therefore, he could not do that.\nThen he was asked to tell them that he did everything under Divine orders. Had it been the will of Allah Ta` ala that this Word should not be recited to them, neither would he have recited that to them, nor would He have let them know about that. Now that it was the very will of Allah Ta` ala that they should be made to listen to precisely that Word, who can dare make any addition or deletion therein?"

In effect, he was saying, ` just think for a moment. Is it not that, much before the revelation of the Qur'an, I have spent a long period of forty years of my life among you? During this period, you have never heard me composing and reciting poetry or writing essays in prose. Had I been proficient in saying something like this Word of Allah, I would have naturally said at least some of it during this period of forty years. In addition to that, you have a direct experience of my character and conduct, particularly of my truth and honesty, during these long forty years of my life among you. You know that I have never lied then. How and why would I start lying now after all those forty years?' This clearly proves that the Holy Prophet ﷺ is true and trustworthy. Whatever there is in the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Ta` ala and has come from Him.\nImportant Note\nNo doubt, this argument of the Qur'an provides a perfect proof of its veracity as the Word of Allah. But, it has also given us a standing rule of conduct in matters of common interest where we must be able to separate the genuine from the counterfeit and the true from the false. When an office or rank of responsibility has to be given to a per-son, it becomes necessary to assess the qualification and capability of the incumbent. To do that, the best rule is to go through the record of his past life. If the person concerned is found to be true and trustworthy, the same can be expected from him in the future as well. And if, there is no evidence to prove his honesty and truth in that person's past life, trusting him for the future just because of what he says or claims is not a wise thing to do. In our time, finding the right person for an office of responsibility has become a nightmare. All sorts of errors (of intent, background research and decision making) are being committed and errors are compounded by widespread disorders (in social and governmental institutions). The real reason why all this is happening is the abandonment of this natural principle in favor of what is customary, formal (or straight dishonest)."

      "text": "Commentary\nDisbelievers and Believers are two separate nationalities: Nationality based on race and country is absurd\nThe statement: كَانَ النَّاسُ إِلَّا أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\t(And people were but one community) in verse 19 means that the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) was essentially a single community of monotheists in the earlier stages of man's presence in the world. Shirk and Kufr were unknown as such. Then came up difference in the principle of pure monotheism that divided human beings in different nations and groups of people.\nHow long this period of a single community of believers last? Original sources of Islamic Tradition tell us that this situation prevailed up to the time of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) (Noah). It was during his time that Shirk and Kufr showed up and he was the one who had to confront it first. (Tafsir Mazhari)\nThen, it is also obvious that there is a long period of time between Sayyidna Adam and Sayyidna Nuh may peace be on them both. Human race had multiplied and population had spread out in the world. The presence of differences in color, ethnicity and social life styles was natural. That people had spread themselves out in different regions would have certainly generated differences on the basis of country and homeland. Then, it is also possible that spoken languages may have become somewhat different. But, the Holy Qur'an did not allow these natural genealogical or tribal differences or those of color and country to become impediments to the grand design of one community. In fact, it did not declare the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) to be different nations and communities because of these differences. Instead, it gave them the status of one community.\nOf course, when Kufr and Shirk spread out and posed a threat to 'Iman or true belief, Kafirs and Mushriks were declared to be a separate community of people as indicated in: فَاخْتَلَفُوا (later, they differed). Another verse of the Holy Qur'an: هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنكُمْ كَافِرٌ‌ وَمِنكُم مُّؤْمِنٌ is He who created you; yet there is among you a disbeliever and there is among you a believer - At-taghabun, 64:2) makes it more explicit. It tells that the thing that separates the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) created by Allah into different peoples is the deviation from 'Iman and Islam. Bonds of lineage or country do not make people separate. Bracketing human beings into different groups on the basis of language, homeland, color or race is ignorance dished out in the garb of enlightenment. It is new. But everything new is not necessarily true and wise. In fact, it might as well be the exact opposite of what is wise. Today, there are many educated people who have also fallen into the trap of this narrow concept of nationalism based on the factors enumerated above. Unfortunately, this approach towards ordering the social life of human beings is fraught with seeds of countless unseen disasters. May Allah keep Muslims safe from its evil effects."

      "text": "The second verse refers to a doubt expressed by the Mushriks, and provides its answer. In a nutshell, these people had, out of their ignorance, somehow decided that a Messenger or Prophet who comes from Allah Ta ala should not be a human being (al-bashar), instead, he should be an angel. The Qur'an has refuted this absurd idea of theirs on several occasions from different angles. In one such verse, it was قُل لَّوْ كَانَ فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ مَلَائِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ مَلَكًا رَّ‌سُولًا ﴿95﴾ said: (Say, Had there been angels walking in peace on the Earth, We would have certainly sent to them from the heavens an angel-messenger!\" - 17:95). In sum, the mission of a messenger cannot be accomplished unless there is a mutual homogeneity between this messenger and those to whom he is sent. Angels are homogenous to angels and human beings to human beings. If the purpose is to send a messenger for human beings, only a human being has to be made a messenger.\nThe same subject has been taken up in this verse in a different manner. The text sees no reason why would people wonder that a human being was made a messenger? Why was a human being entrusted with the mission of warning the disobedient ones against the punishment of Allah? Why was the task of heralding the good news of His re-wards to the obedient ones assigned again to a human being? This kind of wondering deserves a counter-wonder, for sending a human messenger to the human race is perfect commonsense.\nGood news to believers has been given in this verse by saying: قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَ‌بِّهِمْ (that they will have a perfect place with their Lord). The initial meaning of the word: قَدَم (qadam) used here is ` step' as in English. Since 'qadam' is the medium of a person's effort, and advancement in its wake, therefore, a higher rank is called a 'qadam' in a figurative sense. Then, by attributing 'qadam' (high rank, place of honor) to صِدق ` sidq' (perfect as being true, certain, abiding, everlasting), it was emphasized that the high rank they were to get was real, certain, established, abiding and everlasting. This was not something like the ranks and offices of the mortal world. To begin with, it is never certain that one would get these at all. If, as a result of some extra effort, one does get one of these, their continuity cannot be certain. In fact, what is certain is that these will vanish in time. Sometimes, this could happen within one's lifetime. But, when comes the time to die, one goes empty-handed. All ranks, offices, blessings remain behind. So, the word: (sidq) includes the sense of certainty, and also that of being perfect and everlasting in it. Therefore, the sentence means: 0 Proph-et, give believers the good news that they will have a perfect place with their Lord, an asset that is certain and lasting.\nSome commentators have said: Through the introduction of the word sidq at this place, an indication has been given that these high ranks can be achieved only through truth and absolute sincerity. Mere verbal claims of having faith and a formal recital of the Kalimah of 'Iman is not enough, until one embraces the faith, truly and duly, verbally and emotionally and intellectually. It will invariably result in adherence to good deeds and avoidance of the evil ones."

      "text": "Commentary\nDisbelievers and Believers are two separate nationalities: Nationality based on race and country is absurd\nThe statement: كَانَ النَّاسُ إِلَّا أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً\t(And people were but one community) in verse 19 means that the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) was essentially a single community of monotheists in the earlier stages of man's presence in the world. Shirk and Kufr were unknown as such. Then came up difference in the principle of pure monotheism that divided human beings in different nations and groups of people.\nHow long this period of a single community of believers last? Original sources of Islamic Tradition tell us that this situation prevailed up to the time of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) (Noah). It was during his time that Shirk and Kufr showed up and he was the one who had to confront it first. (Tafsir Mazhari)\nThen, it is also obvious that there is a long period of time between Sayyidna Adam and Sayyidna Nuh may peace be on them both. Human race had multiplied and population had spread out in the world. The presence of differences in color, ethnicity and social life styles was natural. That people had spread themselves out in different regions would have certainly generated differences on the basis of country and homeland. Then, it is also possible that spoken languages may have become somewhat different. But, the Holy Qur'an did not allow these natural genealogical or tribal differences or those of color and country to become impediments to the grand design of one community. In fact, it did not declare the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) to be different nations and communities because of these differences. Instead, it gave them the status of one community.\nOf course, when Kufr and Shirk spread out and posed a threat to 'Iman or true belief, Kafirs and Mushriks were declared to be a separate community of people as indicated in: فَاخْتَلَفُوا (later, they differed). Another verse of the Holy Qur'an: هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنكُمْ كَافِرٌ‌ وَمِنكُم مُّؤْمِنٌ is He who created you; yet there is among you a disbeliever and there is among you a believer - At-taghabun, 64:2) makes it more explicit. It tells that the thing that separates the progeny of Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) created by Allah into different peoples is the deviation from 'Iman and Islam. Bonds of lineage or country do not make people separate. Bracketing human beings into different groups on the basis of language, homeland, color or race is ignorance dished out in the garb of enlightenment. It is new. But everything new is not necessarily true and wise. In fact, it might as well be the exact opposite of what is wise. Today, there are many educated people who have also fallen into the trap of this narrow concept of nationalism based on the factors enumerated above. Unfortunately, this approach towards ordering the social life of human beings is fraught with seeds of countless unseen disasters. May Allah keep Muslims safe from its evil effects."

      "text": "Commentary\nIn the previous verse (24), the transitory nature of worldly life was likened to a field. Water came from the heavens and it became verdant with flowers and fruits and crops. Growers were happy to presume that this will take care of everything they needed. But, because of their acts of disobedience, some unforeseen Divine punishment descended during the time of the night or day. Everything stood wiped off - as if nothing had existed there. This was the state of worldly life. After that comes a description of the life-to-come as it would be (25).\nIt was said: وَاللَّـهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ‌ السَّلَامِ (And Allah invites [ people ] to the Abode of Peace). It means a Home where absolute and eternal peace reigns, a Home that has neither pain and sorrow, nor the danger of disease, nor the concern of adverse change or sudden extinction.\n` Daru's-Salam' means the Jannah or Paradise. One reason why it has been called Daru 's-Salam is that everyone will have ideal peace and security there. The second reason appears in some reports from Hadith. They say that Jannah has been given the name of Daru 's-Salam also because its dwellers shall always be receiving Salam greetings from Allah Ta` ala, and from the angels as well. In fact, the word سلام :Salam would itself be a sort of technical keyword used by the people of Jannah to express their wishes which the angels would fulfill. For details, please see the commentary on verse 10.\nWhile explaining this verse, Yahya ibn Mu` adh has given some man-to-man advice to whomsoever it may reach:\n` O son of Adam! Allah Almighty invited you to the Home of Peace (Daru 's-Salam). When and from which country would you take that right step in response to this Divine call? Understand, and mark it well. If you have started making efforts to say yes to this invitation (from your Lord) while you are still here in this world, you will succeed. You will reach the Home of Peace. And if you wasted the years of your life here, then landed in your grave, and then thought of following this call, you will be stopped. You will not move from there, not even one step - because, the place where you are is no Home of Deeds (Daru 'l-Amal).'\nSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ عنہما\tsaid, ` Daru 's-Salam is one of the seven names of Jannah.' (Tafsir al-Qurtubi)\nThis tells us that it is not proper to name a house in this world as Daru 's-Salam. Similarly, it is also not correct to give it names like Jannah or Firdaus (Paradise).\nAfter that, it was said in the cited verse: وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَ‌اطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ (and He brings whom He wills to a straight path - 25)."

      "text": "The sense is that the invitation to the Abode of Peace (Daru 's-Salam) is universal, open to all human beings and, in terms of this sense, guidance too is open to all. But, there is a kind of guidance that is special. Here, a seeker is made to stand on the straight path and given the ability to move ahead on course. This is Taufiq at its best. Only fortunate people are blessed with it.\nCompared in the first two verses (24, 25) were the two Abodes of the present world and the world-to-come. Mention was also made of the states in which their dwellers were. The next four verses (26-29) de-scribe the reward and punishment of both. Taken up first were the people of Paradise. About them it was said that those who opted for good, the greatest good was that of 'Iman (belief and faith) supplemented by staunch adherence to al-'amalu 's-Salih (good deeds). They will have the best of returns for what they do, not simply what is coming to them as due, but much more than it.\nThe tafsir of this verse was given by the Holy Prophet\tﷺ himself. He explained it by saying, ` at this place, اَلحُسنیٰ :al-husna: the best [ of return ] means Jannah (Paradise) and (ziyadah: something more) means the visit to the most exalted Allah with which the people of Jannah shall be honored. (Tafsir al-Qurtubi on the authority of Sayyidna Anas ؓ .\nAs for the reality of Paradise, this much every Muslim knows that it is a place of bliss beyond human imagination now. And as for the visit to Allah Ta` ala, that is far superior to whatever blessings there are.\nAccording to a narration of Sayyidna Suhayb ؓ appearing in the Sahih of Muslim, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported to have said, ` when the people of Jannah would have entered Jannah, Allah Ta` ala will address them: \"Do you need anything? If so, tell Us. We shall fulfill it.\" The people of Jannah will submit: \"You made our faces radiant with delight. You let us be in Jannah. You delivered us from Jahannam. What else can we ask for?\" That will be the time when the hi jab obstructing the view in between will be removed. The people of Jannah, one and all, will be blessed with seeing their true Lord. They will then discover that this was a blessing far more sub-lime than all other blessings of Jannah, something they had not even thought about, something the Lord of all the worlds bestowed upon them without their having to ask for it simply out of His infinite affection and mercy!'\nThen, the text describes the state of the same people of Jannah by saying that their faces will remain free of any effects of distaste, pain or sorrow, nor will they have to be worried about any disgrace. These are conditions everyone faces in the mortal world one or the other time - and those who go to Jahannam will face it in the Hereafter.\nIn contrast, the state of the people of Jahannam has been described by saying that those who came with evil deeds in their record will have an equal return for each evil without any increase in it. They will have disgrace all over them. There will be no one to save them from the punishment of Allah. Dark will be their faces, so dark as if layers upon layers of a night have covered them up."

      "ayah": 3,
      "surah": 10,
      "text": "In the third verse, the Oneness of Allah (Tauhid) has been proved through the undeniable reality that there is no associate or partner to Allah Ta` ala when it comes to the creation of the heavens and the earth and then to the management and operation of this entire universal system. When this reality stands established, how could someone else be made an associate or partner in His pristine Divinity or in worship for Him and in obedience to Him? In fact, doing so is the highest conceivable injustice.\nIt was said in this verse that Allah Ta'ala has created the heavens and the earth in six days. But, the day as we know it denotes the time from sunrise to sunset - and it is obvious that the sun did not exist be-fore the creation of the heavens, earth and stars. How then could sunrise and sunset be calculated? Therefore, intended here is the measure of time utilized in between sunrise and sunset.\nMaking this huge world composed of the heavens, the Earth, the planets and the universe as a whole, ready and functional (a virtual turn-key job, so to say), can only be attributed to the Being who is the purest of the pure and exercises power that is absolute. When He in-tends to create, He needs no raw materials in advance or any staff to assist. Such is the station and degree of His perfect power that He, as and when He intends to create what He wills, creates instantly, with-out any raw materials or personnel or technical support. The time duration of these six days has only been chosen in consideration of His particular wisdom. Otherwise, it was also within His power that He could have created the heavens and the Earth and what it contained in a single instant.\nAfter that it was said: ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْ‌شِ (then He took a straight position on the Throne). That which stands proved from the Qur'an, and Hadith is that the Arsh عَرش (Throne) of the Rahman رَحمٰن (the All-Merciful Allah) is some created object which encompasses the entire heavens and the Earth and the whole universe thereof. Thus, seen conversely, all that there is fits into the room inside it. Knowing anymore about its reality is beyond any human effort. No doubt, scientific knowledge in our time is at its zenith. Man is getting ready to reach planets comparatively nearer with mixed measures of success. However, scientists still confess that the distant planets are so far away from us that information about these through available instrumentation cannot be relied upon as a mirror of reality. Then, there are stars in the firmament even light from where has not yet reached our Earth - even though, as we know, the speed of light is 1, 86, 000 miles per second. When this is the graph of human limitations in scaling planets and stars, how could human efforts to find out what we know as the heavens farther and higher from stars and planets be taken as credible (or even reasonable). And finally, what is believed to be the ` Arsh of the Rahman - encompassing all there is, even above what is termed as the seventh heaven - is a reality seeking access to which through technical ingenuity needs no comment.\nSo, up to this point, the third verse has told us that Allah Ta` ala created the heavens and the earth and the whole system of the universe in six days, and ` after that He took a position on the Throne'. (The last sentence is a word arrangement in English for the words of the text: ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْ‌شِ [ thumma 's-tawa ala 'l-'arsh ] which should be understood in the light of the comments appearing below).\nThis is certain, and evident enough that Allah, the high and the true, is above and beyond the human concepts of body and mass and of all attributes and characteristics they may have. Neither does His existence relate to any direction or form, nor is His stay in a place like the staying of the things of the world where they belong. Now then, how are we to explain the nature, mode or manner of His staying, establishing or positioning on the ` Arsh or Throne? This can be explained only by saying that these are from what is called ` mutashabihat' (statements of hidden meaning) in the terminology of Qur'an, a phenomena that cannot be comprehended by human reason. Therefore, about it, says the Qur'an: وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللَّـهُ ۗ وَالرَّ‌اسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ (no one knows its interpretation except Allah. And those [ who are ] well-grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe therein; - 3: 7) - and just do not bother to go digging out its reality. Therefore, there is a standard approach in all such matters where the attribution of Allah Ta` ala has been made to a place or form, or where words, such as hand, face and shank, have appeared in the Qur'an for Allah Ta` ala. The ` Aqidah (belief) of the majority of the ` Ulama of the Muslim Ummah is that one believes these words to be true in their place, and believes what Allah Ta` ala means by them is correct, and believes that the concern to know about its nature and reality should be set aside as being beyond one's ability to comprehend it.\nAs for the later day ` Ulama who have suggested some meanings to these things, they have done it only in a degree of probability, even in their own sight. They simply suggest - perhaps, it may mean this. They never say that the meanings they have given are certain. As obvious, probabilities disclose no reality. Therefore, the only simple and straight creed (maslak مَسلَک) is that of the Sababah (Companions), the Tabi` in (Successors to Companions) and the Salaf (the righteous and worthy forebears and elders of the Faith). They were satisfied to live with the approach of entrusting the reality of such matters with Di-vine Knowledge.\nThis brings us to the next statement: يُدَبِّرُ‌ الْأَمْرَ‌ (He manages all matters). It means that, positioned on the Throne, He Himself manages all universes by virtue of His power. Then, comes the succeeding sentence: مَا مِن شَفِيعٍ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِ translated as: ` There is no intercessor except after His permission.' It tells us that such is the majesty of Allah Ta'ala that even a Prophet and Messenger cannot intercede on behalf of anyone, on their own, before Him - unless Allah Ta` ala Himself grants them the permission to intercede, without which even they could not do that."

      "surah": 10,
      "text": "Commentary\nThese two verses mention some signs openly visible in the universe of our experience. They are evidences of the perfect power and eloquent wisdom of the most exalted Allah. They prove that the Lord Almighty is fully capable of bringing about the end of this universe, reducing it to particles, then reassembling the particles and bringing everything back to life, all anew, making everyone account for one's deeds and get punishment or reward as enforced. And when He does that, it will be nothing but reasonable and wise. Thus, these two verses are an extension of what was said briefly in verse 3. Mentioned there was the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days, the positioning on the Throne and the management of matters. The later proved that He did not, after having created the universe, abandon it to survive on its own, instead, He manages, directs and controls everything, all the time, every moment.\nThe opening statement of verse هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ‌ نُورً‌ا firm (He is the One who has made the sun a glow and the moon a light) is a part of this very system and its management. Both words: ضِيَاءً (diya' ) and نُورً‌ (nur) mean glow and light, therefore, many master lexicographers have taken these as synonyms. ` Allamah al-Zamakhshari, al-Tibi, beside some others, said: Though the sense of light is common to both words, but نُور nur is general. Whether strong or weak, dim or clear, every light is referred to as nur, while ضُوء و ضِیَاء\t(daw' and diya' ) refer to light that is strong and clear. One needs both kinds of light. For the usual business of life, the sharp and clear light of the day is required, while the com-paratively dim light of the night is preferred for ordinary chores. If the day had nothing but the pale light of the moon, business will be affected adversely, and if the sun were to keep shining also during the night, sleep and chores that must be taken care of at that time alone would be disturbed. Therefore, nature made arrangements to provide both kinds of light by giving sunlight the degree of daw' ضُوء and diya' ضِیَاء and let it manifest itself at the time when people are busy in business, vocation or other avenues of livelihood. And the moonlight was made to be gentle, pale and pleasing and the night was appointed to be the time of its manifestation.\nThe Holy Qur'an has differentiated the lights of the sun and the moon variously at several places. In Surah Nuh, it was said: وَجَعَلَ الْقَمَرَ‌ فِيهِنَّ نُورً‌ا وَجَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ سِرَ‌اجًا ﴿16﴾ I\t(And made the moon a light therein and made the sun, a lamp - 71:16). Again, in Surah al-Furqan, it was said: وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَ‌اجًا وَقَمَرً‌ا مُّنِيرً‌ا 1f (and placed in it [ the sky ] a lamp, and a shining moon - 25:61). 'Siraj' means lamp and since the light from a lamp is its own and not borrowed from somewhere else, therefore, some commentators have said that ضیا (diya' ) is the intrinsic light of something while (nar) is extrinsic light derived from something else. This semantic approach appears to be influenced by Greek thought, otherwise it has no lexical basis and the Qur'an too has not given any categorical verdict about it.\nZajjaj takes diya' to be the plural of daw'. Perhaps, this may be indicative of the Sun being a compendium of the seven colours of light which show up in the post-rain rainbow. (Al-Manar)\nAnother manifestation of Divine power related to the system of the sun and the moon appears in the second sentence of verse وَقَدَّرَ‌هُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ ` and determined for it stages, so that you may know the number of years and the calculation (of time).' The word قَدَّرَ‌هُ ('qaddara' ) is a derivation from تَقدِیر (taqdir) which means to maintain something at the level of a particular quantity and measure in terms of time or place or attributes. To keep the timings of the night and the day at a particular measure, the Holy Qur'an has said: وَاللَّـهُ يُقَدِّرُ‌ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ‌ (And Allah determines [ the measure on the night and the day - 73:20). That spatial and travel distances have been kept at a particular measure finds mention elsewhere. In Surah Saba,' it was said about the habitations lying in between Syria and Saba': وَقَدَّرْ‌نَا فِيهَا السَّيْرَ‌(and We determined between them the [ distance on journey - 34:18). And about quantitative measures in general, it was said: وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَقَدَّرَ‌هُ تَقْدِيرً‌ا (and created everything then determined a measure for it, determining precisely - Surah a1-Furgan, 25:2).\nThe word: مَنَازِل (manazil) in the verse under study is the plural form of مَنَزِل (manzil) which essentially means the place one arrives at on a journey, its stage or destination. Allah Ta` ala has appointed specific limits for the movement of the Sun and the Moon, each of which is called مَنَزِل manzil or stage. Since the Moon completes its orbit of the Earth every month, the count of its stages comes to thirty or twenty nine. However, since the Moon is not visible at least for a day, therefore, its stages are usually known as twenty- eight. The orbit of the Sun is complete in a year and it has 360 or 365 stages. During the Arab Jahiliy-ah, and by astronomers and mathematicians as well, particular names were given to these stages as borrowed from stars located in their proximity. Being above such technical nomenclatures, the Holy Qur'an has simply referred to the distances the Sun and the Moon cover in specified number of days.\nIn the verse under discussion, the words: قَدَّرَ‌هُ مَنَازِلَ (and determined for it stages) have been used with a pronoun in the singular form - although, being referred to here are the stages of both the Sun and the Moon. Therefore, some commentators say that, no doubt, what has been mentioned here is in the singular form, but in terms of the reference to each single one, it includes both. Examples of this usage abound in the Qur'an, and Arabic idiom.\nSome other commentators have said, ` though, Allah Ta` ala has determined stages for the Sun and the Moon both but, at this place, the purpose is to describe the stages of the Moon only. Therefore, the pro-noun in قَدَّرَ‌هُ (qaddarahu: determined for it) refers back to the Moon. The reason for this specification is that one cannot find out the stages of the Sun without the help of relevant instruments and calculations. Sunrise and sunset follow the same pattern every day throughout the year. A simple observation cannot tell anybody in what stage the Sun is on a given day. This is contrary to the case of the Moon. It’ s states are different every day. By the end of the month, it is just not visible. By observing such changes, even uneducated people can figure out the dates. For example, let us say the date today is March 8. Now, by just looking at the Sun, nobody can tell whether it is the 8th or the 21st. The case of the Moon is different. One can find out the date even by looking at it.\nIn the cited verse, the purpose is to tell people that man's own interest is also tied to these great signs of Allah Ta` ala since the count of years, months and its dates can be kept through them. No doubt, this calculation can be made from the Sun and the Moon both. Years and months, both Solar and Lunar, are universally known. Then, the Qur'an has also mentioned in Surah al-'Isra' (Banu Isra'il):\nوَجَعَلْنَا اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ‌ آيَتَيْنِ ۖ فَمَحَوْنَا آيَةَ اللَّيْلِ وَجَعَلْنَا آيَةَ النَّهَارِ‌ مُبْصِرَ‌ةً لِّتَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّ‌بِّكُمْ وَلِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ\nAnd We made the night and the day two signs. Then made the sign of the night disappear, and put the sign of the day with the light to see, so that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may come to know the number of years, and the count (of time) - (17:12).\nHere, ` the sign of the night' means the Moon and ` the sign of the day,' the Sun. It is only after having mentioned both that it was said that you can find out the number of years and the dates of the months from these. And in Surah Ar-Rahman it was said: which tells us that we can calculate the date, the month and the year through the Sun and the Moon both.\nBut, the calculation of month and date through the Moon is based on observation and experience. On the contrary, when done through the Sun, the calculations are so complex that no one other than regular mathematicians would understand them. Therefore, after having mentioned both the Sun and the Moon in this verse, when the Qur'an talks about having determined their stages, it elects to say: قَدَّرَ‌هُ (qaddarahu: determined for it) using the pronoun in its singular form, whereby mentioned there were the stages of the Moon only.\nSince great attention is paid in the injunctions of Islam, practically in all situations, to ensure that abiding by them is easy for everyone - educated or uneducated, urbanized or rustic - therefore, reliance has usually been placed on lunar year, month and dates in its laws. Thus, it is the lunar calendar that operates in all matters of Islamic obligations and duties, such as, Salah, Sawm, Zakah, ` Iddah etc.\nThis does not mean that using the Solar Calendar is impermissible. In fact, one can choose to use the Lunar Calendar in the case of Salah, Sawm, Hajj, Zakah and ` Iddah in accordance with the Shari’ ah, but use the Solar Calendar in commercial and vocational activities. However, this is subject to the condition that the Lunar Calendar must continue to be in use among Muslims on a collective basis, so that the occasions and timings of religious obligations such as Ramadan and Hajj are in common knowledge at all times. This is to avoid the terrible situation in which Muslims just know no other months but January, February etc. Muslim jurists, may the mercy of Allah be on them, have placed the responsibility of keeping the Lunar Calendar alive and functional on Muslims as Fard al-Kifayah (collective obligation).\nAnd there is no doubt about it that the Calendar used in the Tradition of the blessed prophets and in the Sunnah of the Last among them, the Holy Prophet ﷺ and in the practice of his rightly-guided Khulafa' was no other but this very Lunar Calendar. Using it, following in their footsteps, is certainly an effective cause of blessings and rewards for modern day Muslims as well.\nIn short, the verse points out to the perfect power and wisdom of Allah who created two inexhaustible treasure troves of light so harmoniously synchronized with the rest of the creation. And then, He determined ideal measures of their movement which help us find the time frame we are in, the year, the month, the day and its hours right up to every second. Neither does their movement vary, nor do they go ahead or remain behind, nor do these God-made marvels of what we call machines need any workshop appointments for repairs, nor greasing, nor replacement of worn-out parts. Someone in eternity had asked them to move and be good. This they are doing even today.\nFor added warning, it was said at the end of the verse (5): مَا خَلَقَ اللَّـهُ ذَٰلِكَ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ يُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ (Allah has not created all this but for something right. He elaborates the signs for a people who understand). It means that Allah did not create all these things in vain. There is great wisdom behind it, and certainly numerous are the benefits they bring for human beings. These are elaborated signs. They are loud and clear. They are telling the truth to people who are blessed with reason and insight."

      "surah": 10,
      "text": "Commentary\nPrevious verses described how astray the disbelievers and polytheists had gone and what punishments had become due against them in the Hereafter.\nShown to them in the first two verses was the way out of their living in error and also the source through which they would find deliverance from the punishment of the Hereafter. And that source is Qur'an, the Book of Allah, and His Messenger, Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ .\nBoth are great blessings for humanity, far superior to the entire blessings of the heavens and the earth. Following the injunctions of the Qur'an and the way of the Holy Prophet ﷺ go on to make human beings human in the real sense - and when this human person becomes the perfect man in the real sense, the whole world corrects and reorders itself like a paradise on earth.\nThe first (57) of the five verses cited above mentions four attributes of the Holy Qur'an:\n1. ADVICE as in مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّ‌بِّكُمْ (an advice from your Lord).\nThe real meaning of the word: مَّوْعِظَةٌ (maw` izah) and: موعظ ، (wa` z) is to delineate such things as would make one's heart soft and receptive. As a result, it would incline towards Allah Ta` ala. The barrier of heedlessness acquired from excessive indulgence in worldly life will stand removed. Ultimately, this advice would result in the flowering of a personal concern for what would happen in Akhirah, the life ahead. The Holy Qur'an, from the beginning to the end, is an eloquent preacher of this very good counsel. See anywhere, you will find promise with warning, reward with punishment, and prosperity and success in Dunya and Akhirah with a corresponding fate due to error and straying. Appearing recurrently in varying shades and blending, it generates a powerful appeal which has the ability to make a heart stone-hard turn soft and pliable like water all ready to absorb the message. Of course, on top of everything, there is the miraculous diction of the Holy Qur'an that, by itself, has a class of its own in the matter of reversal of hearts.\nThe complement of: مِّن رَّ‌بِّكُمْ (from your Lord) with (advice) has elevated the status of Qur'anic advice to a much higher level. It is telling us that this advice is not coming from a helpless human being that does not hold the keys to anyone's profit and loss or reward and punishment, nor has any credibility of his own. Instead, the advice is from the merciful Lord whose Word admits of no error, and whose promise and warning too are free of any apprehension of some weakness or excuse.\n2. CURE as in: شِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ‌ (a cure for what is in your hearts).\nThe word: شِفَاءٌ (shifa' ) means the removal of disease and: صدُورِ‌ (sudur) is the plural form of: صدر (sadr) which means the chest, and it signifies the heart.\nThe sense is that the Holy Qur'an is a successful remedy of the diseases of the heart. It corrects and cures it as a prescription of legendary elixir would. The famous Hasan al-Basri (رح) said, ` from this attribute of the Qur'an, we learn that it is a cure for the diseases of the heart specifically, and not that of physical diseases. (Ruh al-Ma` ani)\nBut, other scholars have said that the Holy Qur'an is a cure for every disease, whether spiritual or physical. However, spiritual diseases are far more harmful for men and women than physical diseases. Then, the treatment of such diseases too is not in everyone's control. Therefore, at this place, only spiritual diseases that relate to the heart have been mentioned. From this it does not necessarily follow that it is not a cure for physical diseases.\nHadith reports and countless experiments of the religious scholars of the Muslim community are witnesses to the fact that the way the Holy Qur'an is a great elixir for diseases of the heart, very similarly, it is the best of treatments for physical diseases also.\nAs narrated by Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ someone came to Holy Prophet ﷺ and complained that he felt he had a chest problem. He said, ` recite the Qur'an, for Allah Ta` ala says: شِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ‌ that is, ` the Qur'an is a cure for all such diseases as are found insides chests.' (Ruh al-Ma` ani from Ibn Marduwayh)\nSimilarly, according to the narration of Sayyidna Wathilah ibn Asqa' ؓ someone came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and said that he had a throat problem. He told him the same thing - ` recite the Qur'an'.\nScholars of the Muslim community have compiled the properties and efficacies of the Qur'anic verses in regular books by extracting these partly from narratives of Hadith and the sayings of the Sahabah, and partly from their own experiments and experience. Imam al-Ghazali's work on ` Qur'anic Properties' is well known in this area. Maulana Ashraf ` Ali Thanavi's (رح) \"A'mal-i-Qur'anii, an abridgement of this work, has been popular among readers of Urdu for over fifty years. Then, there are so many observations and experiments in this field which prove that different verses of the Holy Qur'an have been a total cure for physical diseases as well. Denying all of them is not possible. However, this much can be conceded that the real purpose of the revelation of the Holy Qur'an is to remove the diseases of the heart and soul while, as a corollary, it is also the most effective treatment of even physical diseases.\nThis also tells us that those who recite the Holy Qur'an only to treat physical diseases or to seek nothing but the fulfillment of worldly needs are low in sense and high in waywardness. Such people never bother to correct spiritual diseases, nor do they pay any heed to the need of doing things in accordance with the instructions given by the Qur'an. For such people, Iqbal said:\nترا حاصل زیٰس اش جزین نیست کہ ازھم خواندنش آسان بمیری\nYour gain from Ya Sin is but that:\nBy reciting it, death becomes easy.\nThough, he is suggesting, had you pondered over its meaning and message, realities and insights, you would have gained much more of its benefits and blessings.\nSome research-oriented commentators who have gone deeper into the meanings of the Qur'an have said that the first attribute of the Qur'an, that is, مَّوْعِظَةٌ (maw'izah: advice, good counsel) relates to man's obvious, outward or physically-accomplished deeds known as the Shari` ah. The Holy Qur'an is the best source of the correction and betterment of such deeds. Then, the second attribute: شِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ‌ (a cure for what is in your hearts) relates to man's hidden, inward or heart-oriented deeds known as Tariqah and Tasawwuf.\n3. GUIDANCE as in: وَهُدًى (and guidance).\nThe word: هُدًى (huda) means guidance or the showing of or leading onto the way. The Holy Qur'an invites human beings to the way of truth and faith. It invites them to ponder over the great signs Allah Ta'ala has placed in the near and far ranges of the world, even inside their own person, [ staggering would certainly be the interior distances of the universe within us ] and recognize the creator and master of everything."

      "surah": 10,
      "text": "4. MERCY as in\tوَرَ‌حْمَةٌ (and mercy for the believers).\nIn the second verse (58), it was said: قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّـهِ وَبِرَ‌حْمَتِهِ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَ‌حُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ‌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ ﴿58﴾ (Say, \"With the grace of Allah and with His mercy\" - in these they should rejoice. It is far better than what they accumulate). The sense of the verse is that people should take only the grace and mercy of Allah Ta` ala as the real thing to be delighted about and be pleased with it. As for the short-lived worldly wealth, possession, comfort and recognition, these are things not worth being happy about in the real sense. Because, to start with, no matter how much one has, it turns out to be not as much as one would have wished. It becomes a cycle that never ends. Then, there is that ever-lurking danger that it may start declining any time. Therefore, at the end of the verse, it was said: هُوَ خَيْرٌ‌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ (It is far better than what they accumulate). Thus, the core of the meaning is that the grace and mercy of Allah is far better than the layers upon layers of wealth and property and worldly recognition and power one accumulates as the sum-total of one's entire life.\nTwo things have been identified as a source of delight in this verse, one being grace, and the other, mercy. What do these two mean here? Regarding this, there is a Hadith from Sayyidna Anas ؓ عنہ\twhere it has been reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, فضل ` the :fadl (grace) of Allah denotes the Qur'an and: رحمہ : rahmah (mercy) means that you were blessed with the taufiq (ability) of reciting the Qur'an and acting in accordance with it.' (Ruh al-Ma` ani from Ibn Marduwayh)\nThe same thing has also been reported from Sayyidna Bara' ibn ` Azib and Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ while there are many commentators who say that fadl (grace) means the Qur'an while rahmah (mercy) signifies Islam. However, the sense remains the same as given in the Hadith appearing earlier, that is, rahmah (mercy) means that Allah Ta` ala taught us the Qur'an, gave us the taufiq to follow it practically, and that is what Islam is in reality.\nAnd Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas\tرضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما\tnarrates that fdll means the Qur'an, and rahmah refers to the Holy Prophet ﷺ This interpretation finds support in the verse of the Holy Qur'an where it is said: وَمَا أَرْ‌سَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَ‌حْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ ﴿107﴾ (And We have not sent you [ 0 Muhammad ] except as mercy for the worlds - 21:107). However, the outcome of this too is no different from the earlier tafsir - because, acting in accordance with the Qur'an, or Islam ultimately reverts to following the lead given by the Holy Prophet Ili through his word and deed.\nIn this verse, the word: فَلْيَفْرَ‌حُوا (they should rejoice) has appeared in the third person in accordance with its well-known rendition (qira'ah), although its real addressees were those present there or were living at that time. The exigency of the situation required that the form used should have been that in the second person - as it does actually appear in some renditions. But, the wisdom behind the use of the third person, as in the well-known rendition, is that the universal mercy of the Holy Prophet ﷺ or Islam, was not restricted only to those present there, or living at that time. Instead, it included even the generations that will be born right through the last day of Qiyamah. (Ruh al-Ma` ni)\nSpecial Note\nAt this point it is worth our attention that there is another verse of the Qur'an which, in terms of its outward literal sense, seems to indicate that this world is just no place for any highly stimulated expression of joy and merriment. It was said: لَا تَفْرَ‌حْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَرِ‌حِين (Do not exult. Indeed, Allah does not like the exultant - Al-Qasas 28:76). The word: لَا تَفْرَ‌حْ (la tafrah) translated here as ` do not exult' means rejoicing in triumph or intoxication. But, in the verse under study (58), the command to rejoice appears in the imperative mood. One answer for this seemingly apparent contradiction is that the place where rejoicing has been prohibited is a place where rejoicing relates to the fleeting enjoyments of the mortal world. And the place where rejoicing is commanded is a place where rejoicing is related to the grace and mercy of Allah Ta` ala. Then, there is yet another difference here. Wherever rejoicing is prohibited, it does not refer to rejoicing in the absolute sense. Instead, it means getting euphoric and intoxicated in exultation and rejoicing. And wherever permitted, it means rejoicing in an absolute sense."

A severe warning of no less a punishment than that of the day of Qiyamah has been given to those who commit this crime (60). This tells us that the fact of something being Halal or Haram does not depend on human opinion. Instead of that, it is the special right and prerogative of Allah Ta` ala and His Messenger.

These are open proofs (of the Oneness of Allah and the inevitability of the Hereafter) for those who fear Allah.\nThat they are proofs of the Oneness of Allah (Tauhid) is not difficult to see. He has the power to make things happen. He makes things as no one can. He creates everything without the help of materials, personnel and prototype, and has the mastery to operate them under a system that never breaks or must be replaced.\nAnd they are proofs of the 'Akhirah (Hereafter) because Allah is a great creator. He created, in His infinite wisdom, objects of such pro-portion and efficiency for the benefit of human beings. Then, He made them follow a remarkably stable system. Now, it is not possible that He would have created human beings, who are the served ones in this universe, just for nothing, or just to eat and drink, or in some other nonchalant manner without assigning any duties to them. When it stands settled that some restrictions must apply to the served one of this universe, it also becomes necessary that those who observe or do not observe these restrictions should face an accounting of what they have done, sometime, somewhere. Naturally, those who do observe these shall be rewarded and those who do not shall be punished. Then, it is also obvious that things do not work like this in the present world of our experience. Here, reward and punishment do not follow that pattern. It is quite likely that a criminal here may be living better as compared to someone God-fearing, righteous and innocent. Therefore, it is necessary to have a day for the accounting of deeds, rewards and punishments. This is what Qiyamah (The Last Day) and 'Akhirah (Hereafter) are."

The address is to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . He is being told that nothing he does by way of his work or recital of the Qur'an remains hidden from Allah. Similarly, whatever all human beings do remains before Him. And not even a single particle in the heavens and the earth is concealed from Him. Rather, everything is written in the clear Book, that is, the Preserved Tablet (al lawh al-mahfuz).\nAt this place, as it seems, the wisdom of describing the all-encompassing nature of Divine knowledge is aimed at consoling the Holy Prophet ﷺ that his enemies cannot harm him in any way for he was under the protection of Allah Ta` ala."

      "text": "Commentary\nIn the verses cited above, particular merits, definition and identity of the Auliya' of Allah have been mentioned. Also given there is good news for them in the present world as well as in the Hereafter. The text says that they will have no apprehensions of facing some unpleasant or unforeseen happening, nor will they grieve over the non-fulfillment of some objective. These Auliya' of Allah (men of Allah) will be people who believed and remained pious, righteous and God fearing. They are most welcome in this world and in the next world both.\nWe have to consider three things at this point:\n1.\tWhat is the meaning of Auliya' of Allah having no fear and grief?\n2.\tWhat is the definition of Auliya' of Allah? How does one identify them?\n3.\tWhat does the good news given to them in Dunya and Akhirah mean?\nFirst of all, the Auliya' of Allah have no fear or grief. This could possibly mean when they are admitted to their allocated place in Paradise, after having gone through the accounting of deeds in the Hereafter, they will stand delivered from fear and grief forever. They will have no apprehension of any pain or anxiety nor will they have to grieve for having lost something dear to them. Instead, the blessings of Paradise will be everlasting. Given this sense, there is no difficulty in rationalizing the subject of the verse. But, it does, however, raise a question. If this be the case, it registers no peculiarity of the Auliya' of Allah. In fact, all people of Paradise who stand delivered from Hell will be enjoying that very state of being. Yes, it can, then, be said that those who ultimately reach Paradise will all be known as the Auliya' of Allah invariably. No matter how different their deeds had been in the mortal world but, once they have entered Paradise, all of them will be counted among the Auliya' of Allah.\nBut, many commentators say that freedom from fear and grief with which the Auliya' of Allah are blessed is common to the present world and the Hereafter both. The thing unique about the Auliya' of Allah is that they remain protected from fear and grief even in the present world, and that they will have no fear and grief in the Hereafter is something everyone knows. So, included therein are all people of Para-dise.\nApart from that, in terms of relevant prevailing conditions, we have yet another difficulty on our hands. Observations in the world of our experience bear out that - not to mention the Auliya' of Allah - even the Prophets of Allah, may peace be on them, are not secure from fear and grief in this mortal world. In fact, their fear of and humbleness before Allah is far more pronounced as compared to others. It was said in the Qur'an: إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّـهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ (Among Our servants only those who have knowledge (really) fear Allah - 35:28). At another place, the emotional state of the righteous and the men of Allah has been de-scribed in the following words: وَالَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَ‌بِّهِم مُّشْفِقُونَ ﴿27﴾ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَ‌بِّهِمْ غَيْرُ‌ مَأْمُونٍ ﴿28﴾ (And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord - indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not to be un-fearful of - 70:27) that is, no one can sit home comfortably in the knowledge that it is due to come.\nThis is borne by facts as well as it appears in a Hadith of Shama'il al-Tirmidhi: ` The Holy Prophet ﷺ would more than often look concerned and pensive'. And he himself said, ` I fear Allah more than all of you.'\nThere are countless events relating to Sayyidna Abu Bakr, Sayyidna ` Umar and the rest of the Sahabah ؓ ، the Tabi` in and the wide spectrum of the men of Allah which tell us how intensely they grieved and how genuinely they feared what would happen to them in the Hereafter.\nTherefore, ` Allamah 'Alusi has said in Ruh al-Ma'ani: That the Auliya' Allah are protected against fear and grief in the mortal world has to be seen in terms of what usually happens here. There are things worldly people generally fear or grieve about most of the time. They are chronically addicted to their mundane agenda of life. They have to have convenience, comfort, wealth and recognition. The slightest shortfall in any of these makes them nervous as if they were going to die without that. The fear of a minor discomfort or anxiety drives them crazy and they will go about finding ways and means to get rid of such irritants. The station of the Auliya', friends or men of Allah is way higher. In their sight, convenience, comfort, wealth and recognition one surrounds himself with in this transitory world are not worth their while that they go about acquiring these. Nor do they care much about the anxieties of the mundane and see no need to beef up their defenses against these. Their life style admits of nothing but the recognition of His greatness and love for Him. So overshadowed they are with the fear of Allah and their humbleness before Him that they just have no use for worldly sorrow and comfort or profit and loss.\nNow we can go to the matter of the definition of Auliya' Allah and the marks of their identification. The word: اولیاء (Auliya' ) is the plural form of: ولی (waliyy, commonly rendered as the simpler: wall, which bypasses the need to render the doubling of the y ā sound at the end shown by the addition of a or two, as purists would prefer to do). The word: ولی (waliyy) is used in the Arabic language in the dual sense of ` near' as well as ` friend' or someone held ` dear.' The common degree of nearness and love as related to Allah Ta` ala is such as would not leave any living entity, human or non-human, exempt from it. If this element of nearness were not there, nothing would have come into being in this universe. The real justification for the existence of this entire universe is that particular interrelationship which it has been al-lowed to have by Allah in His absolute majesty. Though, no one has understood the reality of this interrelationship, nor is it possible to do so, but that a non-definable interrelationship does exist is certain. However, this degree is not what is actually meant in the term: Auliya' Allah. In fact, there is yet another degree of friendship, love and nearness that is specific to particular servants of Allah Ta` ala. This is known as nearness in love. Those who are blessed with this nearness are called the Auliya' Allah. This has been succinctly articulated in a Qudsi Hadith where Allah Ta` ala says, ` My servant keeps earning My nearness through voluntary acts of worship (nafl ` ibadat) until I too turn to him in love and when I love him, I become his ear - whatever he hears, he hears through Me. I become his eye - whatever he sees, he sees through Me. I become his hands and feet - whatever he does, he does through Me.' In short, it means that virtually nothing issues forth from such a person against the pleasure of his Lord.\nThe degrees of this unique Wilayah (station of nearness or friend-ship) are endless. Its highest degree is for the blessed prophets be-cause every prophet has to be, of necessity, a Waliyy of Allah. In this degree, the highest station belongs to the foremost among prophets, Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ . Then, the lowest degree of this Wilayah, in the terminology of the noble Sufis, is known as the degree of Fan-a' (self-elimination: I am nothing - He is everything). It makes the heart of man become so engrossed in the thought of Allah Ta` ala that it would not allow any love rooted in this world to overcome it. When such a person loves, he loves for the sake of Allah. When he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah. His own person plays no part in this love and hate cycle, the inevitable outcome of which is that he keeps busy in his quest for the pleasure of Allah Ta` ala both outwardly and inwardly. This style of living makes him avoid everything which is not liked in the sight of Allah Ta` ala. The sign of this state of existence is abundance of Dhikr and constancy in obedience - in other words, to remember Allah Ta` ala abundantly and profusely, and to obey His in-junctions always, and under all conditions and circumstances. When these two attributes are present in a person, he is called a Waliyy of Allah. Whoever does not have any one of the two is not included in that category. Then, whoever has both, there is no limit to his ranks, lower and higher. It is in terms of these degrees that the ranks of Auliya' Allah precede or succeed each other.\nOn the authority of a narration from Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ ، it has been reported in a IIadith that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was asked as to who were the people meant by Auliya' Allah' in this verse? He said, ` those who love each other only for Allah - without having any worldly interest in between.' (Mazhari, quoted from Ibn Marduwayh). It is obvious that this condition can apply only to those who have been mentioned above.\nAt this stage, we have another question before us: What is the method of acquiring this degree of Wilayah (nearness to Allah)?\nRespected commentator, Qadi Thana'ullah Panipati has said in Tafsir Mazhari: Individuals from the Muslim Ummah could acquire this degree of Wilayah only through the company of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . It is from here that the profound relationship with Allah, which was part of the blessed persona of the Holy Prophet ﷺ is partly passed on to the Auliya' of the Ummah, of course, depending on their ambition and capacity for whatever portion from it falls to their lot. Then, we know that this benefit of companionship was available to the Sahabah without anyone being in between. Therefore, the degree of their Wilayah was higher than that of all Auliya' and aqtab (plural of qutb, literally axis, meaning a man of Allah who stays at one place, as in Sufi orders). Later people derive this benefit through one or more intermediaries. The more the intermediaries, the more pro-nounced becomes the difference. Only those who are colored with the color of the word, deed and message of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and follow his Sunnah, in all love and obedience, can become such an intermediary. Going to them, frequenting their company with the added practice of listening to their good counsel, remaining obedient and remembering Allah abundantly - this is the blueprint of attaining the degree of Wilayah. It is made of three parts. One: Being in the company of a Waliyy of Allah. Two: Remaining obedient to his good counsel. Three: Remembering Allah abundantly (Dhikrullah) - with the condition that this abundance (and nature) of Dhikr must be in accordance with the masnun method. The reason is that Dhikr, when frequent and sincere, adds to the luster of the mirror of the heart and it becomes worthy of receiving reflections from the light of Wilayah. It appears in Hadith that everything has a method of furbishing it. Dhikrullah furbishes the heart. The same thing has been reported by al-Baihagi as based on a narration from Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ . (Mazhari)\nSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ عنہما\tsaid that a person asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ\t` what would you say about a person who loves someone spiritually noble but is unable to reach up to his level in terms of his own deeds?' He said: اَلمَرَء مَعَ مَن اَحَبَّ that is, ` everyone shall be with one he loves'. This tells us that the love and company of the Auliya' Allah is a source of acquiring Wilayah (nearness to Allah). Al-Baihaqi (in Shu'ab al-'Iman) has reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said to Sayyidna Razin ؓ tell you about a principle of Faith. With it you can attain success in Dunya. and Akhirah: Take to the company of ahl adh-Dhikr (people who remember Allah) as indispensable, and When you are alone, move your tongue with the Dhikr of Allah, as much as you can. Whoever you love, do it for Allah. Whoever you hate, do it for Allah. (Mazhari)\nBut, in order to be beneficial, this ` company' has to be of those who are, in themselves, the Waliyy of Allah and staunch followers of Sunnah. Those who do not observe and follow the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet ﷺ (and do not demonstrate by their word and deed that they are operating under it) are themselves deprived of the essential degree of Wilayah. It does not matter if many a contrahabitual wonders (kashf and karamat) issue forth from them. They will still be considered deprived. However, if someone is a Waliyy in terms of the stated attributes - even though, nothing of the sort has ever issued forth from him - he is a Waliyy of Allah. (Mazhari)\nNow we come to the last point. What are the signs of the Auliya' Allah? How can they be identified? A Qudsi Hadith referred to in Tafsir Mazhari points out in this direction. Allah Ta` ala said: ` From among My servants, My Auliya' are those who are remembered when I am remembered and when they are remembered I am remembered.' According to a narration from Sayyidah Asma' bint Yazid reported in Ibn Majah, the Holy Prophet ﷺ gave the identity of Auliya' Allah by saying: الذین اذا رُؤُا ذُکِرَ اللہُ\t(those who, when one sees them, remind of Allah).\nIn short, there is someone by sitting in whose company one gets the taufiq of remembering Allah (Dhikr), and relief from worldly concerns, then, this is a sign of his being a Waliyy of Allah.\nIt has been said in Tafsir Mazhari: There is a prevailing assumption among masses that things like getting to know what is hidden (kashf), doing some extraordinary things (karamah) or claiming to be aware of what is al-Ghayb (Unseen) are signs of someone being among the Auliya' of Allah. This is nothing but error and self-deception. There are thousands of Auliya' who are not credited with anything like this, that could be termed as authentically proved while, in sharp contrast, reports of things otherwise hidden and unseen are accredited to those whose very basic 'Iman (belief) is not correct!"

      "text": "Commentary\nIn the previous verses, by mentioning the heavens and the earth and the Moon and the Sun, prominent manifestations of Allah's perfect power and wisdom, the belief in the Oneness of Allah and the Hereafter was proved eloquently. The first three of the present verses tell us that, despite such open signs and evidences spread out in this universe, human beings split up in two groups. One of the two groups was of those who paid just no heed to these Divine signs, failed to recognize their creator and master and failed to recognize even themselves. It never occurred to them that they were no animal like other animals. They never discovered that their Almighty Lord had blessed them with intelligence, reason and commonsense in a degree much higher than that of the animals. Their Lord had put the entire resources of Divine creation at their doorsteps. Everything was as if commissioned to serve them. This should have made them realize that there has to be something their Lord would want them to do, some duty or obligation or charge. If that had to be the case, they would have to ac-count for whatever they had been asked to do. And for this it would be necessary that there should be a day fixed for ultimate reckoning and recompense - known as the day of Qiyamah or al-Hashr (Doomsday, Resurrection) in the terminology of the Qur'an. But, such people did nothing like that, instead, preferred to live their lives at the level of common animals. In the first two verses, after giving the signs and marks of these people, the text mentions the punishment they would receive in the Hereafter. The first thing the text tells is that such people did not think that they would meet their Lord. They have forgotten all about the inevitability of their life in the Hereafter and have become pleased and content with their worldly life alone.\nThen, they are sitting there, so satisfied and so content, as if they just do not have to go anywhere else from here. This, to them, was the end of the line and this was where they have to live forever. It never occurs to them that everyone has to bid farewell to this world. This is so open a truth that no one can go about doubting it. And when going away from here is certain, then, some preparation has to be made for the place one is going to.\nAnd then, they are continuously heedless to Allah's verses and signs. Had they pondered over the marvel of the heavens and the earth and what was created in between them and, for that matter, over what was in the their own person, they would have understood the reality behind everything and they would have thus come out of their fatal negligence.\nThe punishment of people whose signs have been given above is the fire of Jahannam that waits for them in the Hereafter - and this punishment is nothing but the outcome of their own deeds.\nHow regrettable that the signs of disbelievers and deniers pin-pointed by the Qur'an are no different as far as our own present condition as Muslims is concerned. By looking at our way of life and the pattern of our activities and thoughts, no one can come to the conclusion that we have some other concern bothering us except the concerns of this world under our noses. Yet, despite all that, we sit comfortably believing that we are Muslims, as staunch and true as they come. The hard reality is that the kind of staunch and true Muslims our worthy forbears were has become unimaginable for us. They were the ones a look at whose faces would remind one of God and transmit unmistakably that they feared someone above them and their hearts throbbed with the concern of being accountable to Him. Not to say more about these wonderful people, even the Holy Prophet ﷺ despite being protected from sins (ma` sum مَعصُوم), lived his blessed life in that state. It appears in Shama'il al-Tirmidhi that the Holy Prophet ﷺ looked sad and concerned fairly often."

If that had to be the case, they would have to ac-count for whatever they had been asked to do. And for this it would be necessary that there should be a day fixed for ultimate reckoning and recompense - known as the day of Qiyamah or al-Hashr (Doomsday, Resurrection) in the terminology of the Qur'an. But, such people did nothing like that, instead, preferred to live their lives at the level of common animals. In the first two verses, after giving the signs and marks of these people, the text mentions the punishment they would receive in the Hereafter. The first thing the text tells is that such people did not think that they would meet their Lord. They have forgotten all about the inevitability of their life in the Hereafter and have become pleased and content with their worldly life alone.\nThen, they are sitting there, so satisfied and so content, as if they just do not have to go anywhere else from here. This, to them, was the end of the line and this was where they have to live forever. It never occurs to them that everyone has to bid farewell to this world. This is so open a truth that no one can go about doubting it. And when going away from here is certain, then, some preparation has to be made for the place one is going to.\nAnd then, they are continuously heedless to Allah's verses and signs. Had they pondered over the marvel of the heavens and the earth and what was created in between them and, for that matter, over what was in the their own person, they would have understood the reality behind everything and they would have thus come out of their fatal negligence.\nThe punishment of people whose signs have been given above is the fire of Jahannam that waits for them in the Hereafter - and this punishment is nothing but the outcome of their own deeds.\nHow regrettable that the signs of disbelievers and deniers pin-pointed by the Qur'an are no different as far as our own present condition as Muslims is concerned. By looking at our way of life and the pattern of our activities and thoughts, no one can come to the conclusion that we have some other concern bothering us except the concerns of this world under our noses. Yet, despite all that, we sit comfortably believing that we are Muslims, as staunch and true as they come. The hard reality is that the kind of staunch and true Muslims our worthy forbears were has become unimaginable for us. They were the ones a look at whose faces would remind one of God and transmit unmistakably that they feared someone above them and their hearts throbbed with the concern of being accountable to Him. Not to say more about these wonderful people, even the Holy Prophet ﷺ despite being protected from sins (ma` sum مَعصُوم), lived his blessed life in that state. It appears in Shama'il al-Tirmidhi that the Holy Prophet ﷺ looked sad and concerned fairly often."

      "surah": 10,
      "text": "Commentary\nMentioned in the verses appearing immediately above, there are some circumstantial details along with their corresponding injunctions as they relate to Sayyidna Musa and Sayyidna Harun (علیہما السلام) and the children of Isra'il and the people of the Pharaoh. The first verse (87) carries an injunction pertaining to a particular event. Banu Isra'il (the children of Isra'il) who observed the religious law of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) used to perform their prayers only in their synagogues as customary. Then, the past communities were also bound by this injunction. Their prayers were not valid if performed in their homes. The Muslim Ummah was the special recipient of the convenience that they could, if needed, perform their prayers everywhere as they wished. In a Hadith of Sahih Muslim, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has, out of his six singularities, given one as, ` the whole earth has been made a masjid for me.' It means that Salah performed anywhere remains valid. However, it is something else that the performing of obligatory prayers in congregation only in masjids has been declared as an emphasized Sunnah. Then, saying nafl prayers inside homes is better. This was the usual practice of the Holy Prophet i He would say only the Fard Salah in the Masjid then go home and say his sunnahs and nafls there. As for the Banu Isra'il, they were bound to offer their prayers only in their synagogues in obedience to their religious laws. Realizing this, the Pharaoh who used to oppress them in all sorts of ways had all synagogues demolished so that they could be deprived of offering their prayers in accordance with their religious laws. Thereupon, Allah Ta` ala sent to the two prophets of Banu Isra'il, Sayyidna Musa and Harun, may peace be on them both, the injunction mentioned in verse 87. It was said there that new houses should be built in Egypt for Bani Isra'il and that their orientation should be towards the Qiblah so that prayers could be offered in those very residential houses.\nThis tells us that the religious law of past communities demanded that prayers should be offered in houses of worship specifically built for this purpose. But it was because of a particular incident that the Bani Isra'il were temporarily allowed to offer their prayers at home and, for this purpose, they were to have houses oriented towards the Qiblah. And it can also be said that even at this time of emergency they were allowed to offer their prayers in particular houses that were oriented towards the Qiblah. Praying in common homes and public places was still not permitted even at that time. It was unlike the Muslim community that has the convenience of offering their prayers anywhere, be it a city or wilderness. (Ruh al-Ma'ani)\nIt will be good to answer another question at this point. In this verse, the Bani Isra'il have been commanded to orient themselves towards the Qiblah. Which Qiblah is this? The Ka'bah or the Baytu 'l-Maqdis? Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ says, It means the Ka'bah and the Ka'bah alone was the Qiblah of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and his people.' (al-Qurtubi and Ruh al-Ma` ani)\nIn fact, some religious scholars say that the real Qiblah of all past prophets was no other but the Ka'bah.\nAs for the Hadith where it is said that the Jews turn their faces towards the Sakhrah (the Rock) of Baytu 'l-Maqdis during their prayers, it will be applied to the time when Sayyidna Musa left Egypt and headed towards Baytu 'l-Maqdis. This is not contrary to his Qiblah being the Baytullah during the period of his stay in Egypt.\nIt is also proved from this verse that the condition of facing to-wards the Qiblah was operative also during the period of past prophets. Similarly, it also stands proved from authentic reports that purity (taharah) and body cover (satr al-'aurah) were conditions of Salah even in the religious laws of all past prophets.\nSince the very purpose of making houses Qiblah oriented was to pray in there, therefore, by giving the command: ` Establish Salah' (اَقِیمُوا الصَّلٰوۃَ ) after that, the instruction given was: If the Pharaoh stops you from making prayers in places reserved for worship, prayers do not stand dropped. Make these in your homes.\nAt the end of the verse, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) has been asked to convey the good news to believers that their mission will be successful. They will overpower the enemy and they will go to Paradise in the Hereafter. (Ruh al-Ma` ani)\nIt will be noted that, at the beginning of the verse, Sayyidna Musa and Harun (علیہما السلام) may peace be upon them both, were addressed in the dual form because they both were charged with the responsibility of having houses made Qiblah oriented and allowing occupants to pray in there. After that, by using the plural form which included all Bani Isra'il, command was given to establish Salah - because, this law included all, the prophet and his community. At the end, the command to convey the good news was given particularly to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) - because, it was he, as the law-giving prophet, who had the right to give out the good news of Paradise."

      "text": "Mentioned in the second verse (88), there is a curse which Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) invoked after having lost all hopes of reforming the people of the Pharaoh. At its beginning, he submitted before his Lord that He had given the Pharaoh and his group glamour and riches in their worldly life (mines of gold, silver and precious stones in Egypt and Ethiopia - al-Qurtubi). As a result, they misled people from His way. Because, common-people, when they looked at their bulging affluence, they started doubting - had they been in error, why would they have been so blessed? Again, because common-people were unable to see through the reality that material affluence without good deeds cannot be the sign of a person being right and true. It was only after having been disappointed with his efforts to correct the people of the Pharaoh, and having realized the danger it posed for other people who were being misled by the glamour and wealth of the Pharaoh's group that he invoked the curse: رَ‌بَّنَا اطْمِسْ عَلَىٰ أَمْوَالِهِمْ (Our Lord, obliterate their riches).\nAccording to the statement of Sayyidna Qatadah ؓ ، such was the effect of this invocation that all gold, precious coins, stones, land produce belonging to Pharaoh's people were transformed into bland rocks. In a bag found during the period of the pious Khalifah Sayyidna ` Umar ibn ` Abd al-` Aziz (رح) ، there were things dating back to the time of the Pharaoh. Seen in it, there were eggs and almonds of solid rock. Leading commentators say that Allah Ta` ala had turned all fruits, vegetables and grains they had into rocks. This is among the nine ayat (signs or miracles) mentioned in the Qur'an as in: وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ تِسْعَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ رَ‌بَّنَا اطْمِسْ عَلَىٰ أَمْوَالِهِمْ (and We gave Musa [ Moses ] nine clear signs - 17:101).\nThe second curse invoked by Sayyidna Musa\tعلیہ السلام for them appears in the words: وَاشْدُدْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُوا حَتَّىٰ يَرَ‌وُا الْعَذَابَ الْأَلِيمَ (and harden their hearts, so that [ they are deprived of the very ability to receive any good and ] they may not come to believe until they witness the painful punishment - 88).\nThe invocation of this curse obviously appears to be something far out as coming through the speech of an apostle or prophet, because the sole mission of a prophet's life is nothing but to invite people to believe and act right and make efforts towards that end.\nBut, in terms of the hard facts of the situation here, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) has already made whatever efforts he could. He was to-tally disappointed. Now he wanted that they better learn through the punishment for their deeds. In doing so, it was probable that these people, once they see the punishment coming, may make a confession and declare that they now believed, whereby the punishment could stand warded off. Therefore, what became the cause of this invocation from him was his hatred for kufr (disbelief, infidelity). This is similar to what happened to the Pharaoh. When he started to announce his belief at the time he was drowning, the angel, Jibra'il shut his mouth lest Divine mercy turns to him and he stands delivered from the punishment."

      "text": "In the third verse (89), it was said that the prayer of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) has been accepted. But, by taking Sayyidna Harun (علیہ السلام) as associated with the act of prayer, the actual address was made in the words:\tقَدْ أُجِيبَت دَّعْوَتُكُمَا (The prayer of you both has been granted). There was a reason for it. When Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) السلام was making this prayer, Sayyidna Harun (علیہ السلام) kept saying Amin (Amen). This tells us that the saying of Amin آمِین (so be it) is also a part of the prayer itself. And since the masnun method of du` a or prayer given in the Holy Qur'an is that of making it in a lowered voice, the saying of آمِین Amin too in a lowered mode seems to be preferable.\nAs for the acceptance of prayer, the information was given to the two prophets as it appears in this verse. But, even they were some-what tested in that the effect of the prayer, according to al-Baghawi, unfolded after forty years. For this reason, soon after the mention of the acceptance of their prayer in this verse, they both were given the instruction: فَاسْتَقِيمَا وَلَا تَتَّبِعَانِّ سَبِيلَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ (so stand firm, and never follow the way of those who do not know). It means that they should go on carrying the mission of calling people to the true faith and do not get embarrassed, disappointed or hasty like the ignorant when the effects of the acceptance of some prayer takes its due time."

      "text": "Mentioned in the third verse (9) are those fortunate people who pondered over the signs of the most exalted Allah. Thereby, they recognized Him, believed in Him and, by acting in accordance with the dictates of their faith, became duty-bound to say and do what was good and right (al-a` mal as-salihah: good deeds).\nThe good return and reward made due by the Holy Qur'an for these wonderful people has been mentioned in a particular manner. It was said: يَهْدِيهِمْ رَ‌بُّهُم بِإِيمَانِهِمْ (their Lord will guide them by virtue of their belief), that is, ` take them to their destination, the Jannah [ Paradise ], where rivers shall be flowing in the Gardens of Bliss.'\nThe well known meaning of the word: ھِدَیَہ (hidayah) used here is to tell or show the way. Then, on occasions, it is also used in the sense of taking someone all the way to the desired destination. At this place, this is the meaning intended. As for the desired destination, it means Jannah that stands clarified by the words appearing later.\nIt will be recalled that the punishment of the first group was the outcome of their own misdeeds. Here, similar to that, it was said about the reward of the second group (of believers), that they have been blessed with this reward by virtue of their belief. And since, belief has been bracketed with good deeds earlier, therefore, 'Iman or belief mentioned at this place will mean belief that is supported by good deeds (al-a` mal as-salilhah). The return for belief and good deeds is Jannah, the place of unimaginable and unparalleled bliss."

      "text": "The answer to this appearing in the fifth verse (91) came from Allah Almighty Himself. It says:\nآلْآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ ﴿91﴾\nIs it now [ that you come to believe ] while you were rebellious before and you were among the mischief-makers?\nThis proves that the profession of faith exactly at the time of death is not legally trustworthy. It is further clarified by the Hadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 'Allah Ta'ala keeps accepting the Taubah (repentance) of a servant until comes the time of the ghargharah of death. (Tirmidhi)\nThe ghargharah of death means the time the soul or spirit is drawn out or extracted from the body and it is a time when angels appear face to face. At that time, life in this world, the home of deeds, is all over and the laws of the Hereafter come into force. Therefore, nothing done at that time is acceptable, neither belief, nor disbelief. Whoever believes at such a time will not be called a believer. He will not be treated as a believer while shrouding and burying him. This stands proved from the fate of Pharaoh. There is a consensus that he died a disbeliever. This is also what the text of the Qur'an says. In case, someone is reported to have called the belief of the Pharaoh as valid, it will either be suitably interpreted, otherwise the statement would be considered false. (Ruh al-Ma` ani)\nSimilarly, if someone were to utter (God forbid) a word of disbelief (kufr) in a state when the soul is being drawn out of the body, he will not be called a kafir (disbeliever). Instead, a Salah of Janazah (Muslim funeral prayers) will be offered for him and he would be buried like Muslims, and the word of disbelief uttered by him would be interpreted (in his favor). This finds confirmation in what happened in the case of some Auliya' of Allah, specially when that which they uttered bothered people as if what they were uttering was nothing short of kufr (disbelief). However, when they became conscious and explained, it gave relief to everyone and they realized that it was nothing but a declaration of true belief.\nIn short, when the soul is being drawn out and the certain knock of death is on, that time is not counted in the life one lives in this world. Nothing done at that time is valid in terms of the Shari'ah. However, everything is, if done before that. But, those who see this transition from one world to the other have to be very cautious. It is possible to make a mistake in determining the correct situation. Is this the time of the drawing of the soul from the body (naz'atu'r-ruh)? Or, is it the last rattle of death (ghargharatu 'l-maut)? Or, is it that which prevails earlier (usually referred to in English as being in the throes of death or the agony of death or, uncharitably enough, giving up the ghost)?"

      "text": "Commentary\nAddressing Pharaoh in the first verse (92), it was said that Allah will take his body out of the waters after he is drowned so that his body becomes a sign of Divine power, and a lesson for people after him.\nIt happened when, after having crossed the sea, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) told Bani Isra'il about the drowning of the Pharaoh, they were so overawed and subdued by him that they refused to believe the news and said that the Pharaoh was not drowned. To guide them right and to teach others a lesson, Allah Ta'ala had the dead body of Pharaoh thrown ashore by a wave of the sea. Everyone saw it and believed that he had died and then, this corpse became a sort of moral deterrent for everyone. After that, it is not known as to what happened to this corpse ultimately. The place where the dead body of the Pharaoh was found is still known as the mount of Pharaoh.\nSome time back, newspaper reports indicated that the dead body of Pharaoh was found intact and was seen by the public at large and that it was deposited safely in the Cairo Museum. But, it cannot be said with certainty that this is the same Pharaoh who confronted Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) or is some other Pharaoh because names of Pharaohs differ. Every ruler of Egypt in that period of history had the title of Pharaoh.\nBut, no wonder, the Divine power had thrown a drowned dead body ashore. Very similarly, it may have kept it even preserved against spoilage so that it could become a lesson for future generations. And it may still be there! (However it remains essential to learn a lesson from it as compared to becoming excited about its discovery as an archeological triumph).\nAt the end of the verse, it was said that many people pay no heed to the verses and signs of Allah. They do not ponder over them and fail to learn their essential lesson in living a better life. Otherwise, signs abound. They are everywhere, in every particle of this universe. A look at them would help one recognize Allah and His perfect power."

      "text": "The second verse (93) brings the future of a people bulldozed in disgrace by the Pharaoh into sharp focus making it stand out against the evil end of the tyrant. It was said that Allah gave the Bani Isra'il a good place to live. They had the whole country of Egypt for themselves.\nThen, they were given the holy lands of Jordan and Palestine which Allah Ta’ ala had assigned to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) and his progeny as their inheritance. A good place to live has been termed as: مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ (translated as: ` a proper place to live' ) in the Qur'an. The word: صِدْقٍ (sidq) at this place means good and proper. The sense is that they were given a place to live that was suitable and proper for them in every way. Then it was said that Allah gave them their sustenance in the form of Halal and pure things so much so that they had the best of everything.\nTowards the end of the verse, once again, their penchant for crookedness and evil doing has been mentioned. Among them too, there were many who, soon after having power, failed to appreciate the blessings of Allah and went about disobeying Him. They recited the Torah and they knew the signs and marks of the Holy Prophet ﷺ mentioned there. This awareness demanded that they should have been the first to believe in him as soon as he came. But, how strange that these very people believed in the coming of the last prophet, Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ before he actually came. They would tell people about the signs he would have and the time he would come. They would even use the wasilah (medium) of the last prophet in their prayers. But, when the last prophet came with a whole array of evidences of his veracity, and the signs identified in the Torah, these people started disputing among themselves. Some of them believed while the rest refused to do so. In this verse, the coming of the Holy Prophet ﷺ to has been expressed by saying: جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ (knowledge came to them). Here, علم (` ilm) could also denote certitude. In that case, it would mean that once the causes of observation and certitude converged together, these people started disputing.\nSome commentators have said that عِلم (ilm: knowledge) at this place denotes مَعلُوم (ma` lum: known), that is, when the blessed person who was already known through the prophesies of the Torah came before them face to face, they started disputing the truth.\nAt the end of the verse, it was said that Allah Ta'ala will give His verdict about what they used to dispute, on the day of Qiyamah. Truth will then become distinct from falsehood and the upholders of truth will be sent to Paradise while the practitioners of falsehood, to Hell."

Therefore, the purpose is to beam the message to the Muslim community through this address where he is not the intended recipient. Then, it is also possible that this address may be to human beings at large asking them if they had any doubts about the Divine revelation sent to them through Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ . If they had, let them ask those who recited the Torah and Injil before them. They would tell them that all past prophets and their Books have been announcing the glad tidings of the Last among Prophets. This will remove their scruples and suspicions.\nAccording to Tafsir Mazhari, this verse tells us that anyone in doubt about some religious matter is duty-bound to have his doubts removed by asking genuine ` Ulama' (religious scholars whose learning, honesty and adherence to Qur'an, and Sunnah is well recognized, popularly referred to as ` Ulama' al-Haqq). To continue nursing such doubts is not a good thing to do."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."

      "text": "In the seventh verse (98), the heedless deniers of truth have been admonished for their failure to make the optimum use of the time of life allowed to them. There was still time for them to leave denial and contumacy. Otherwise, an ominous time was due to come when they will make Taubah but their Taubah will not be accepted. They will say that they believed but their belief will not be welcome. And that time will be the time when the punishment of the Hereafter will appear right before their eyes at the time of death. It was in this connection that an event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and his people was mentioned - that has good counsels and great lessons in it.\nIt has been asked in this verse that the people who denied truth could have believed at a time when their believing would have been of benefit to them. It means that there was no use for it at the hour of death, or the punishment, or after being neck deep in it, or at the time Doomsday sets in for the doors of repentance will then be closed and no repentance or belief from anyone will be acceptable. Now that they still had the time, they could put their contumacy aside and become believers very much like the people of Prophet Yunus (علیہ السلام) did. When they, much before the worse happened, saw the Divine punishment coming, they lost no time, repented and believed. For this reason, Allah Ta` ala removed the painful punishment from them.\nThe gist of the tafsir given above is that the door of Taubah does not close even when the worldly punishment comes face to face. However, Taubah is not accepted at the time the punishment of the Hereafter comes face to face. As for the coming of the punishment of the Hereafter face to face, it would either be on the day of Qiyamah or at the time of death, whether it is natural death or death as a victim of some worldly punishment as was the case with the Pharaoh.\nTherefore, the acceptance of the Taubah of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is not contrary to the Divine law. In fact, it falls under it because they, no doubt, made their Taubah when they saw the punishment coming, but they certainly did so before the punishment overtook them, and did it before death too. This is contrary to what the Pharaoh and others did. They did their Taubah only after the punishment had overtaken them, and did that at the time of the last rattle of death, saying that they believed. Therefore, their believing was not valid and trustworthy and the Taubah they made was not accepted.\nA precedent of the event relating to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is the event relating to Bani Isra'il which finds mention in the Holy Qur'an itself. In this event, the mount of Tur was left dangling over their heads so that they were scared enough to repent. They repented and their Taubah was accepted. This appears in Surah al-Baqarah where it was said:\nرَ‌فَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ‌ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ\nAnd raised high above you the (Mount on Tur: \"Hold fast to what We have given to you\" - 2:63\nThe reason was that they had, much before the punishment materialized and death overtook them, repented simply by noticing the imminent danger of punishment. Similarly, when the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) saw the punishment coming, they sincerely wept and wailed and repented details of which will appear a little later. So, the acceptance of this Taubah is not counter to the Divine law stated above. (Qurtubi)\nAt this stage, some contemporaries have made a grave error. They attribute shortcomings to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the discharge of his duties as a prophet. They declare that the cause of the removal of punishment from the people was the failing of the prophet and that this very failing was the cause of Divine displeasure which is mentioned in Surah al-Anbiya' and Surah As-Saffat. Their words are as given below:\nقرآن کے اشارات اور صحیفہ یونس کی تفصیلات پر غور کرنے سے اتنی بات صاف معلوم ہو جاتی ہے کہ حضرت یونس (علیہ السلام) سے فریضہ رسالت ادا کرنے میں کچھ کو تاھیاں ہوگئی تھیں اور غالباً انہوں نے بےصبر ہو کر قبل از وقت اپنا مستقر چھوڑ دیا تھا، اس لٔے جب آثار عذاب دیکھ کر آشوریوں نے توبہ و استغفار کی تو اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں معاف کردیا، قرآن میں خدأی دستور کے جو اصول و کلیات بیان کیے گئے ہیں ان میں ایک مستقل دفعہ یہ بھی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کسی قوم کو اسوقت تک عذاب نہیں دیتا جن تک اس پر اپنی حجت پوری نہیں کردیتا، پس جب نبی ادأے رسالت میں کوتاہی کر گیا اور اللہ کے مقرر کردہ وقت سے پہلے قوم کو عذاب دینا گوارا نہ کیا۔ (تفہیم القرآن مولانا مودودی، ص 321، ج 2، طبع 1964)\n` By considering the hints of the Qur'an and the details of the book of Jonah, at least this much becomes clear that some shortcomings had issued forth from Hadrat Yunus peace be on him, in the performance of his duty as a prophet. And, most probably, becoming impatient, he had abandoned his permanent station before time. Therefore, having seen the signs of punishment, the Assyrians repented and sought forgiveness, then Allah Ta` ala forgave them. Out of the principles and universals of Divine Law described in the Qur'an, there is this standing article as well - that Allah Ta` ala does not punish a people until He establishes His argument against them conclusively. So, when the prophet went about falling short in doing his duty as a prophet and, on his own, vacated his station (of duty) before the time determined by Allah, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing those people.\" (Tafhimul-Qur'anl by Maulana Mawdudi, p. 321, volume 2, published 1964)2\n1.\tOrdinary changes have been made, without any prior public announcement of withdrawal from these remarks, in the later editions of Tafhimul-Qur'an, that is, the words: فریضہ رسالت کی ادایٔگی میں کو تاھی : ` shortcomings in the performance of duty as a prophet,' are not there in the new text. But, the following observations are still there: جب نبی نے۔۔۔۔ پوری نہیں ہوتی تھیں : When the prophet did not continue the mission of giving good counsel to those people up to the last moment of the respite given to them and, before the time determined by Allah, he himself, in a self-serving way, migrated out and away, then, the justice of Allah Ta` ala did not bear by punishing his people, because the legal conditions of a conclusive argument against them had yet to be fulfilled.\" Thus, despite the change in the text of the Tafhimul-Qur'an, the comment of Ma'ariful-Qur'an stands as is. - Idaratul-Ma` arif, publishers, October/ 1991.\n2.\tApart from the religious aspects of the observations quoted above which have been dealt with in the Commentary of this Tafsir, the language used to convey these has contributed significantly in making the observations acidly vulnerable. For example, the use of verbs towards the end: کر گیا (kar gaya), ھٹ گیا (hat gaya) and گوارا نہ کیا (gawara na kiya) are hot action words in the present context. When used for a prophet, they are terrible. When attributed to God, like the last one, they are presumptuous. The liberty taken through language is difficult to transplant in translation. By ignoring it, the translator turns traitor. So, the translator has made the extra effort to stay within functional limits and render the text as it is. Since, the Urdu original has been reproduced here, discerning readers who read it should have no problem in making their independent judgment about the rendering - Tr.\nThe first thing to look at here is that the prophets, peace be upon them all, are protected from sins (ma` sum). This is an uncontested belief on which there is a consensus of the Muslim Ummah. In its details, some partial differences do exist, for instance, is this protection (` ismah) from all kinds of minor sins (saghirah), or from the major ones (kabirah) only, and whether or not this protection (` ismah) includes the period of time before being inducted as a prophet? But, no difference exists among any individuals or groups in the belief that the blessed prophets, all of them, can never fall short in carrying out their duty as prophets. The reason is that there could be no greater sin for prophets than that they themselves fall short in taking care of the mission for which Allah Ta` ala had chosen them. This is an open breach of trust in assigned duty, something beyond even ordinary nice people anywhere. If a prophet does not stand protected (ma` sum) even from this short-coming, then, there is no use for protection from other sins.\nIf there were something somewhere even in the Qur'an, and Hadith, seemingly contrary to the established principles of Qur'an, and Sunnah, and the collective Muslim belief in prophets being protected from sins, it would have been necessary to interpret it in a way that would not have left it discordant and different from the absolutely proven principles of Qur'an, and Hadith.\nBut, things are strange here. What the learned author has presented with reference to ` Qur'anic hints and details of the book of Jonah' may possibly be in the book of Jonah, and so be it, being something having no validity in the sight of the people of Islam. As for a ` Qur'anic hint, there is none, not just one. In fact, what has happened here is that this presumption has been forced out of a patched pattern of several premises. First of all, it was presumed that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) took place contrary to Divine law - which is totally contrary to the context of this very verse, and equally contrary to the explications of recognized authorities in the field of Tafsir. Along with it, it was also assumed that Divine law was broken on this occasion because the prophet himself had failed to fulfill his duty as a prophet. Again, along with that, it was also assumed that some particular time had been fixed by Allah Ta` ala when he was supposed to leave the place - and he, much before this supposedly fixed time, abandoned his duty of calling people to truth and ran for life!\nIf seen with the least deliberation and fairness, it will stand proved that no hint from the Qur'an, or Hadith points out to these assumed premises.\nTo consider what precedes in the verse of the Qur'an itself, let us look at the words of the verse:\nفَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْ‌يَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ\nSo, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yunus (Jonah) !\nThe sense, as already clear, is that of regret over the state of inertia prevailing among common residents of habitations around the world. It is in that spirit that it was said: How would they not become such as would have believed at a time when believing is acceptable and beneficial? In other words, they could have believed before being hit by punishment or death, in which case, their believing would have been accepted. But, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) were an exception to this rule, for they, by seeing the signs of punishment, and much before being hit by the punishment, believed and their believing and repentance came to be accepted.\nThis evident sense of the verse is itself telling us that no Divine law has been broken here, in fact, exactly in accordance with Divine practice, their faith and repentance have been accepted.\nMost commentators - Abu Hayyan, Al-Qurtubi, Al-Zamakhshari, Qadi Thana'ullah, ` Allamah Alusi and others - have given this very sense of the verse according to which the acceptance of repentance from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) comes under the customary Divine law. The words of Al-Qurtubi appear as given below:\nو قال ابن جُبَیرغشیھم العذاب کما یغشی الثوب القبر، فلما صحت توبتھم رفع اللہ عنھم العذاب، وقال اطبری : خص قوم یونس (علیہ السلام) من بین سایٔر الامم بان تیب علیکھم بعد معاینۃ العذاب، و ذکر ذلک عن جماعۃ من المفسرین۔ وقال الزجاج، انھم لم یقع بھم العذاب، وانمارأوا العلامۃ التی تدل علی العذاب ولورأوا عین العذاب لما نفعھم ایمانھم ۔ قلت قول الزجاج حسن، فان العاینۃ التی لا تنفع التوبۃ معھا ھی التلبس بالعذاب کقصۃ فرعون و لھذا جاء بقصہ قوم یونس علی اثر قصۃ فرعون، و یعضد ھذا قولہ (علیہ السلام) : ان اللہ یقبل توبۃ العبد مالم یغرغر والغرغرۃ، الحشرجۃ، وذلک ھو حال التلبس بالموت، وقد روی معنی ما قلناہ عن ابن مسعود ؓ (الی) و ھذا یدل علی ان توبتھم قبل رؤیۃ العذاب (الی) و علی ھذا فلا اشکال ولا تعارض ولا خصوص۔\n\"Ibn Jubayr says that the punishment had covered them up like the sheet of cloth on the grave. Then, as their Taubah turned out to be sound (being before the punishment materialized), Allah Ta` ala lifted the punishment from them. And At-Tabari says that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) have been given a special place among all other peoples in that their Taubah was accepted after they had seen the punishment. And that has been mentioned by a large number of commentators. However, Az-Zajjaj says that the punishment had not yet fallen on those people. They had only seen the signs that proved the coming of the punishment. And if they had seen the very punishment falling upon them, their believing would have then been no good for them (and their Taubah too would have not been accepted). Al-Qurtubi says that the statement of Az-Zajjaj is better because the seeing of a punishment after which Taubah is not accepted means that in which one is seized - as it happened in the case of Pharaoh. Therefore, in this very Surah, the event of the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been taken up immediately after the event relating to the Pharaoh. (So that the difference becomes clear in that the belief of the Pharaoh came after having been seized by the punishment, contrary to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who came to believe before the punishment actually seized them). This is confirmed by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، Allah Ta` ala accepts the Taubah of the servant until he is rattled by death.' And ` al-ghargharah' (as in the Hadith) is the rattling sound that comes from the throat and that is what happens on being seized by death. And the same thing is evident from the riwayah of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ in which it has been said that the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had repented before the actual falling of the pun-ishment. And Al-Qurtubi says, as based on this explanation, there remains no difficulty, or contradiction, or particularization (of the people of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام).\nAs for At-Tabari and other commentators who have deemed this event to be special to the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) ، none of them have said that the reason of this special treatment was the ` shortcomings' of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . Instead, the honest repentance of those people and their sincere belief in Divine knowledge are the kind of reasons that they have given to that end.\nAnd now, when we know that the removal of the punishment from the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was just not against the Divine law, in fact, was exactly in accordance with it, then, the very foundation of what has been postulated here stands demolished.\nSimilarly, there is no Qur'anic hint to prove that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) once he had given the warning of punishment, broke away from his people without prior Divine permission. Instead, the context of verses and reports from Tafsir tell us that things happened here as they had happened with all past communities, that is, when the decision was made to send Divine punishment on a people, Allah Ta` ala would command his Messenger and his companions to leave that area. This has been clearly mentioned in the Qur'an in connection with the story of Sayyidna Lut Very similarly, here too, when this command of Allah was delivered to those people through Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام۔ that the punishment will come after three days - then, the departure of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) from that area has, obviously enough, taken place under Divine orders.\nOf course, there was a slip from Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in terms of the elegant prophetic station he was blessed with. Words of displeasure about it appear in Surah al-Anbiya' (21:87, 88) and Surah as-Saffat (37:139-148) and, as a result of which, came the event of his staying in the belly of a fish. But, this slip has nothing to do with the assumed assertion that he fell short in fulfilling his duty as a prophet. In fact, what actually happened is what has been stated earlier with reference to authentic Tafsirs. In brief, after Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had delivered the warning to his people that the punishment will come after three days as willed by Allah, he left his place and went out. Later, it was proved that the punishment did not materialize. Now, Sayyidna Yunus was worried as to how he would go back to his people. If he did, they would charge him to be a liar. And the law of those people required that a proven liar must be killed. Now, this added the danger of the likely loss of life in returning to his people. Under such circumstances, he had no way out but to migrate from that very country. But, the customary practice of the blessed prophets is that they do not migrate simply on the authority of their personal opinion - unless the signal to migrate comes from Allah Ta` ala. So, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was no more than that he boarded a boat with the intention of migration, before came the permission of Allah. This was, though no sin in itself, but different from the customary practice of prophets it was. If we were to ponder over the words of the verse of the Qur'an, the slip of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) will not turn out to be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet. In fact, it would prove not to be anything else but migration before permission with the aim of staying safe against the oppression of his people. The verse of Surah as-Saffat is virtually explicit regarding this subject. It was said: إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ (when he ran away towards the laden boat - 37:140). Here, the act of boarding a boat with the intention of migration has been expressed through the word: أَبَقَ (abaqa) denoting displeasure. It means the running away or fleeing of a slave without the permission of his master. And in the verse of Surah al-Anbiya', it has been said: وَذَا النُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ‌ عَلَيْهِ (and the man of the fish, when he left in anger assuming that We shall not keep him tight - 21:87). Here the tenor of speech is that of displeasure over the act of migration that was resorted to because of natural apprehension and the desire to stay protected from a hostile people. It is worth keeping in mind that all this happened after the perfect fulfillment of the duties of prophethood, only when a return to his people posed a certain danger to his life. Tafsir Ruh al-Ma'ani has taken up this subject in the following words:\nای غضبان علی قومہ لشدۃ شکیمتھم وتمادی اصرارھم مع طول دعوتہ ایاھم، وکان ذھابہ ھذا سھم ھجرۃ عنھم، لکنہ لم یؤمر بہ\n(Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام) left his people in anger against their bitter hostility and adamant infidelity despite that he had spent a long time as a prophet inviting them to faith. This journey of his was a kind of migration but he had not yet received the permission for it.\nHere, it has been made clear that some shortcoming in carrying out the prophetic mission was not the cause of Divine displeasure, in-stead, it was migration before permission that did become its cause - which, by itself, was no sin. But, because of being contrary to the customary practice of blessed prophets, it was received with displeasure. When some ` Ulama sounded the learned contemporary about this error, he chose to report the sayings of many commentators relating to the Tafsir of Surah as-Saffat, in support of his stand.\nAmong these - with the exception of some Israelite reports of Wahb ibn Munabbih and others - not a single report proves his stand, that shortcomings were committed (God forbid) by Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) in the fulfillment of his duty as a prophet, as correct.\nAnd it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that commentators generally include Israelite reports in their Tafsirs about which all of them agree that these are not authentic and trustworthy. No Islamic legal ruling can be based on them. It is only through the crutches of these Israelite reports, whether they appear in the books of Muslim commentators or in the book of Jonah, that this grave accusation can be leveled against Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) that ` he had committed shortcomings in the fulfillment of his duties as a prophet.' No commentator of Islam has ever approved of it.\nوَاللہُ سُبحانَہ و تعالیٰ اَعلَمُ ، وَبِہ استغیث ان یعصمنا من الخطایا والزلالت\nAnd Allah, He is Pure and High and the Most Knowledgeable and before Him is our plaint that He protects us from all errors and lapses.\nDetails of the Event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام)\nPart of the details of the event relating to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) has been mentioned in the Qur'an while some of it has its proof in reports of Hadith and history. According to these sources, the people of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the well-known place, Nineveh near Mousel, Iraq. Their number has been given as more than one hundred thousand in the Holy Qur'an. It was for their guidance that Allah Ta` ala sent Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . They refused to believe. Allah Ta` ala asked Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) to warn these people that Divine punishment was going to overtake them within three days. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the announcement before his people. When they went in consultation with each other, they agreed that they had never found Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lying, therefore, this thing from him was not to be ignored. Finally, they devised a plan to see whether or not Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) stays among them at his place during the night. If he did, they were to understand that nothing would happen. And if he went somewhere else from there, then, they should be certain that the punishment would descend upon them the next morning. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) moved out of his dwelling place during the night as Divinely commanded. When morning came, the Divine punishment, in the form of a cloud-like black smoke started hovering over their heads tending to be descending down closer to them. They then became certain that they all were going to be destroyed. Seeing this, they looked for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) so that they could confess to their past denial, repent and believe with him as the witness. But, when they did not find him, they took it upon themselves to come up with repentance and prayers for forgiveness in the best spirit of sincerity at their command. To do that, they left homes, came out on open grounds, women, children and animals all huddled there. Wearing rags, weeping and wailing, repenting and begging refuge from Divine punishment, they made the whole area resound with a massive collective plaint. Allah Ta` ala accepted their repentance and removed the punishment from them - as mentioned in this verse. Reports indicate that this was 'Ashura, that is, the day of the tenth of Muharram.\nOn the other side, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was waiting outside the township expecting that the Divine punishment will be about to hit the people there. He knew nothing about how they had repented and sought forgiveness. When the punishment stood removed, he started worrying about himself for his people would now declare him to be a liar - because he had announced that the punishment would strike within three days. According to the law of those people, if a person whose lying was known did not produce a witness in his support, he would be killed. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was concerned apprehending that he would be declared a liar and killed.\nThe noble prophets are protected from every act of sin and disobedience, but are not set apart from others in terms of human nature and temperament. At that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) naturally grieved that he had made the announcement as Divinely commanded and now it was because of the announcement he made he would be declared a liar. How could he go back to his place under these circumstances and take the risk of being killed in accordance with the law of his people? Deep in this anxiety, he started off with the intention of getting out of that town until he reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There he saw a boat being boarded by people. They recognized Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) and let him board gratis. The boat sailed. But, when it reached off shore, it stopped suddenly. It refused to move any further, neither forward, nor backward. The boat people made an announcement. They said that Allah had made their boat special. When an oppressive sinner or a slave in flight boards it, the boat stops on its own. So, they said, let that person show himself up so that others do not suffer because of one person.\nSayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) spoke out that he was the sinner and the fleeing slave. As the act of leaving his town and boarding the boat was prompted by a natural apprehension and not by Divine permission, the dignified bearing of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) as a prophet had no hesitation in declaring this act, of coming towards the boat without that permission, a sin. The rule was that no movement of a prophet should have been without Divine permission. So he said, ` Throw me into the sea and be spared of the punishment.' The people of the boat would not do that. They drew lots so that the person thus named could be thrown into the sea. By chance, the lot drawn had the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) on it. They were intrigued. They drew lots again and again. But, as Divine decree would have it, the name that kept appearing repeatedly was that of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) . The Holy Qur'an mentions this drawing of lots and the incidence of the name of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) being drawn therein (to be the one to be thrown overboard): فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ ﴿141﴾ (and he drew lots and was among the losers - 37:141).\nThis dealing of Allah Ta` ala with Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was in view of his special status as a prophet. He had done no contravention of any Divine command that could be called sin or disobedience - for that matter, there exists no possibility of these issuing forth from any prophet because they are ma'sum مَعصُوم (Divinely protected). But, it was not appropriate to the high station of a prophet that he would transfer to another place without Divine permission simply on the basis of natural apprehension. It was this contra-dignity conduct which brought displeasure and resultant action.\nOn the one hand, names were being drawn in lots. The named was waiting to be thrown overboard. On the other hand, a large fish under Divine orders was lurking by the boat with her mouth agape, waiting for the incumbent to be thrown into the sea and right into her belly. Allah Ta` ala had already commanded the fish that the body of Sayyidna Yunus علیہ السلام\tthat was to be deposited in her belly was no food for her, instead, was his home for a while. When Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) was lowered into the sea, the fish received him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ said that Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) lived in the belly of the fish for forty days. It would take him down to the sea bed and to nautical journeys far and wide. The period of his stay in the belly of the fish has also been reported as, five, and one day and few hours. (Mazhari). Only Allah Ta'-al-a knows the truth about it. Living in that state, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) made the following du` a:\nلَّا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِين\nThere is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers - 21: 87.\nAllah Ta'-al-a accepted this prayer and Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was put on the shore alive and unharmed.\nBut, the heat in the belly of the fish had left no hair on his body. Allah Ta’ ala caused a gourd vine to grow near him. Even the shade provided by the leaves on it became a blessing for Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) .\nAnd signaled by Allah Ta` ala, a wild goat would come every morning and evening, stand near him and he would have milk to drink.\nThus, Sayyidna Yunus \tعلیہ السلام was alerted to that slip, and later on, his people too came to know the whole story.\nIn this story, as for parts that have been mentioned in the Qur'an, or stand proved from authentic narratives of Hadith, they are certain. The rest of them come from historical reports - and no ruling of Islamic law can be based on them."
