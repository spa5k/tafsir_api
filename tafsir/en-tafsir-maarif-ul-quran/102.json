      "text": "Special Merit of Surah At-Takathur\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ is reported to have once asked the noble Companions: Is there anyone from amongst you who has the strength to recite one thousand verses a day?\" The blessed Companions replied: \"Who can recite a thousand verses a day?\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"Can you not recite Surah At-Takathur?\" This implies that Surah At-Takathur equals in weight and worth to a thousand verses, thus stressing its great importance. [ Mazhari with reference to Hakim and Baihagi on the authority of Ibn Umar ].\nWarning Against Materialistic Attitude\nVerse [ 1] أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ‌ (You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing [ worldly benefits ].) The word takathur is derived from the root kathrah, and means 'to amass much wealth'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Hasan Basri (رح) have assigned this interpretation to it. Qatadah\tرحمۃ اللہ علیہ says that this word is also used in the sense of 'taking pride in the abundance of material goods'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ reports that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this verse and explained its meaning, thus: \"Acquiring wealth but not paying out of it the obligatory dues.\" [ Qurtubi ]."

      "text": "حَتَّىٰ زُرْ‌تُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ‌Verse [ 2] (until you reach the graves.) Here the words 'reaching the graves' mean 'to die and be buried in the graves', as the following Prophetic Hadith bears testimony to this interpretation. Referring to verse [ 2] of this Surah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: حَتّٰی یِأتیکُم الموت \"until death overtakes you\" [ Ibn Kathir, from by Ibn Abi Hatim ]. The verse thus implies that many people are engrossed in acquiring worldly goods and racing each other in wealth and children etc. and remain neglectful of the Hereafter till death comes upon them, and then they are seized by the divine punishment. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Shikhkhir ؓ reports that one day he visited the Holy Prophet ﷺ while the latter was reciting Surah At-Takathur and was saying:\nیقُول ابن اٰدم مالی مالی و ھل لک من مالک الَّا ما اکلت فافنیت او لبست فابلیت اوتصدّقت فامضیت، وفی روایۃ لمسلم وما سویٰ ذلک فذاھب و تارکہ للناس\n\"The Son of Adam says: 'My wealth, my wealth.' But you do not reap any benefit from your wealth except for that which you ate and you finished it, or that which you clothed yourself with and you wore it out, or that which you gave as charity and you have spent it.\"\nAnd in a narration by Muslim: \"Everything else other than that will go away, and he will leave it for other people. (i.e. inheritors) \" [ Ibn Kathlr and Qurtubi as transmitted by Muslim, Tirmidhl and Ahmad ].\nImam Bukhari records from Sayyidna Anas ؓ عنہ\tthat the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\nلو کان لابن آدم وادیاً من ذھب لا حبّ ان یکون لہ وادیان ولن یملاء فاہ اِلَّا التراب و یتوب اللہ علٰی من تاب۔\n\"If the Son of 'Adam has a valley of gold, he would love to have two valleys, and nothing but the dust of grave will fill his mouth. And Allah accepts the repentance of him who turns to Him in penitence.\"\nSayyidna 'Ubayy Ibn Ka` b ؓ ، referring to the Tradition quoted above, says, \"We used to think that this was a part of the Qur'an until the first verse of Surah At-Takathur was revealed.\" It seems that the Holy Prophet ﷺ recited the verse and interpreted it in his own words. As a result, some of the Companions were under the impression that the Prophetic words were part of the Qur'an. Later on, when the Surah was recited in its entirety, it did not contain the Prophetic words. This made them realize that the Prophetic words were actually of explanatory nature, and not part of the Qur'an."

The phrase 'ain-ul-yagin' (translated above as 'eye of certainty' ) refers to the certainty attained by physical observation, and this is the highest degree of certainty. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ reports that when Holy Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) was on the mount of Tur, his people started worshipping a calf. Allah informed him about this while he was still on the mountain. This piece of information did not affect Musa (علیہ السلام) so much. However, when he returned and saw the Children of Israel, with his own eyes, worshipping the calf, he became so indignant that the tablets of Torah involuntarily fell from his hands.
