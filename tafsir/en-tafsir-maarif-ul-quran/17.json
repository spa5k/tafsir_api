      "text": "Commentary\nDescribed in this verse is the event of Mi` raj (the Ascent to the heavens, or al-'Isra', the midnight journey of the Holy Prophet ﷺ which is a signal honor and distinctive miracle of our Messenger of Allah ﷺ). The word: أَسْرَ‌ىٰ (asra) is a derivation from: اِسْرَ‌ىٰ (isra' ) which literally means to make someone travel at night. After that, the introduction of the word: لَيْلًا (lailan) also makes this sense very clear. Then, by placing this word as a common noun, the indication released was that during this event the time spent was that of a part of the night - not even that of the whole night. The journey from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa mentioned in this verse is called al-'Isra' and the name of the journey from here to the seven heavens is al-Mi` raj. Isra' stands proved under the definitive textual authority of this verse and the Mi` raj finds mention in the verses of Surah an-Najm and is proved by Ahadith appearing in an uninterrupted succession. The word: بِعَبْدِهِ (bi'abdihi: His servant) used here for the Holy Prophet ﷺ is special. It shows that, in this magnificent setting of honor and welcome, when Allah Ta’ ala, on His own, elects to call someone His servant', a unique bond of love lies embedded therein and that this is the highest honor any man could ever have.\nThis is similar to what has been said in another verse: عِبَادُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ الَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ هَوْنًا (and the servants of Ar-Rahman [ the Most Merciful ] are those who walk on the Earth gently - al-Furqan, 25:63) where the objective is to increase the prestige of those who are acceptable with Him. From here, we also learn that the highest achievement man is capable of is to become a perfect servant of Allah - for, on this eve of special honour, the quality of ideal servitude, out of his many attributes of perfection, was chosen. Then, the presence of this expression yields yet another beneficial outcome in that no one gets the wrong impression of divinity from this wonderful journey by night which, from its beginning to the end, is full of extra-habitual miracles. This is something like what happened with the Christians who fell into deception over the event of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) being raised unto the heavens. For this reason, by saying - ('abd: servant), it was declared that, despite all those attributes, achievements and miracles, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was still a servant of Allah, not god.\nThe Qur'an, Sunnah and 'Ijma' prove that the Mi` raj was physical.\nIt is proved from the text of the Holy Qur'an, and from Ahadith coming in uninterrupted succession mentioned later that the entire journey of the Isra' and Mi` raj was not simply spiritual, instead, it was physical - like the journey of anyone else. The very first word of the Holy Qur'an in this Surah: سُبحَانَ (Subhan: Pure is He! ) carries a hint in this direction because this word is used to register wonder or introduce a great marvel. Had the Mi` raj been merely spiritual, just a matter of dream, what was there so unusual about it? As for a dream, every Muslim, even every human being, can see it and report that he or she went to the heavens, did this and did that.\nThe second indication embedded in the word: عَبد ('abd: servant) also points out in the same direction because ` abd is no spirit all by itself, instead, it is the name of the combination of body and spirit.\nIn addition to that, when the Holy Prophet \tﷺ related the event of Mi` raj to Sayyidah Umm Hani ؓ ، she advised him not to mention it before anyone otherwise people would falsify it even more. Had this been the matter of a dream, what was there in it that needed to be falsified?\nAfter that, when he did tell people about it, the disbelievers of Makkah called it a lie and made fun of him, so much so that some neo-Muslims became apostates (murtadd) after hearing the news. If this would have been the matter of a dream, the likelihood of such reactions was least warranted. And that he had experienced some spiritual Mi` raj in the form of a dream, before this or after that, does not become contrary to it. According to the majority of Muslim scholars, the word: الرُّ‌ؤْيَا (ar-ru'ya) in the verse of the Qur'an: وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّ‌ؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَ‌يْنَاكَ (And We showed you the scene - 17:60) means: رُؤیۃ (ruyah: seeing). But, it has been expressed through the word: رؤیا (ru۔ ya, which is frequently used in the sense of seeing a dream). The reason for this expression could be that this thing has been called ru'ya in the sense of a simile. This is like someone seeing a dream. And if, ru’ ya is taken to mean dream itself, then, it is also not too far out to say that the event of Mi` raj, in addition to its being physical, also transpired, before or after it, in the form of a spiritual Mi` raj as a dream as well. Therefore, the saying, that it was a dream, reported from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ is also correct in its place - but, it does not necessarily imply that physical Mi` raj did not take place.\nIt appears in Tafsir al-Qurtubi that the Ahadith relating to the event of al-Isra' are recurrent and uninterrupted. Naqqash has reported related narratives from twenty Sahabah of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then, Qadi 'Iyad has given additional details in Al-Shifa' (Qurtubi).\nIrnam Ibn Kathir (رح) has, in his Tafsir, reported all these narratives and after applying the standard rules of scrutiny has mentioned the names of twentyfive Sahabah from whom these reports come. Their names are:\n1.\tSayyidna ` Umar ibn al-Khattab,\n2.\tSayyidna 'Ali al-Murtada,\n3.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud,\n4.\tSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari,\n5.\tSayyidna Malik ibn Sa` sa` ah,\n6.\tSayyidna Abu Hurairah,\n7.\tSayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri,\n8.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas,\n9.\tSayyidna Shaddad ibn Aws,\n10.\tSayyidna Ubaiyy ibn Ka'b,\n11.\tSayyidna ` Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Quraz,\n12.\tSayyidna Abu Hayyah (اَبُو حیہ),\n13.\tSayyidna Abu Laila,\n14.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar,\n15.\tSayyidna Jabir ibn ` Abdullah,\n16.\tSayyidna Hudhayfah ibn Yaman,\n17.\tSayyidna Buraidah,\n18.\tSayyidna Abu Ayyut al-Ansari,\n19.\tSayyidna Abu 'Umamah,\n20.\tSayyidna Samurah ibn Jundub,\n21.\tSayyidna Abu al-Hamra',\n22.\tSayyidna Suhayb al-Rumi,\n23.\tSayyidah Umm Hani',\n24.\tUmm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah,\n25.\tSayyidah Asma' bint Abi Bakr, After that, Ibn Kathir said:\nفَحدِیث الاسراِء اجمع علیہ المسلمون و اعرض عنہ الزنادقۃ و الملحدون (ابن کثیر)\nAs for the Hadith of al-Isra', there is a consensus of all Muslim on it. Only heretics and atheists have denied it. (Ibn Kathir)\nA brief account of Mi` raj - as reported by Ibn Kathir\nAfter having explained the present verse in his Tafsir along with a detailed background of relevant Ahadith, Imam Ibn Kathir (رح) has said: The truth of the matter is that the journey of Isra' came to pass when the Holy Prophet ﷺ was awake, not dreaming. From Makkah al-Mukarramah to Baitulmaqdis, the journey was covered on buraq (a special heavenly horse to ride). When he reached the gate of Baitulmaqdis, he tied the buraq close to the gate, entered the Masjid of Baitulmaqdis and offered two rak’ at of Tahiyyatul-masjid (prayer in honor of the Mosque) facing its orientation. After that, a staircase was brought which had steps to go up from below. Through this staircase, he went to the first heaven. After that, he went to the rest of the heavens. [ Only Allah knows the reality of this staircase - what it was and how did it work and things like that. In our day too, many kinds of stairs are in use. There are stairs that escalate automatically and there are elevators that take one up. Therefore, falling into any doubt or suspicion about this miraculous staircase is not right.] On every heaven, the resident angels greeted him and on every heaven, he met blessed prophets who were stationed on a particular heaven, such as, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) on the sixth heaven, and Sayyidna Ibrahim Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) on the seventh heaven. After that, he went beyond the stations of all these blessed prophets and reached a plain where he could hear the sound of the pen writing destinies. And he saw the Sidratul-muntaha, the Far Tree in Jannah, on which moths in gold and variegated colors were falling from above by the command of Allah and which was surrounded by angels of Allah. And it was at this place that the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw Sayyidna Jibra` il al-Amin in his real form with six hundred wings. And right there, he saw a flag in green that had the horizon all covered up. And he also saw al-Bayt al-Ma` mur (the well-attended House believed to be located in Jannah exactly above the Baytullah in Makkah) sitting by which was the founder of the Ka'bah, Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) with his back reclining against its wall. Seventy thousand angels enter this Bayt al-Ma` mur every day who shall be waiting for their turn to re-enter there right through the day of Qiyamah. And the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw the Jannah and the Jahannam with his own blessed eyes. At that time, first came the command that his people were being obligated with fifty prayers, then, these were reduced to five. This shows the importance and merit of Salah as being the foremost out of all acts of ` Ibadah.\nAfter that, he alighted back into Baytul-maqdis and, with him, so did the blessed prophets he had met on different heavens (as if) they had come to see him off as far as Baytul-maqdis. At that time, as it was time for Salah, he offered the prayer with all prophets. It is also probable that this Salah was the Salah of Fajr the same day. Ibn Kathir says that this event concerning the prayer with prophets led by the Holy Prophet ﷺ has come to pass, as held by some, before he went to the heavens. But, as obvious, this event took place after the return because it has been reported in the incident relating to his meeting with blessed prophets at different heavens that it was Sayyidna Jibra'il who introduced him to all prophets. Had this event relating to his leading the prayer passed earlier, no introduction was needed there - and, for that matter, it is obvious enough that the real purpose of this journey was to visit with the heavenly hosts. Doing that first appears to be more likely. Once he was done with the real mission, all prophets came to say good bye to him up to Baytul-maqdis and by making him the Imam of the prayer through a signal from Sayyidna Jibra'il, his precedence over others was demonstrated practically.\nAfter that, he departed from Baytul-maqdis riding buraq and reached Makkah al-Mu` azzamah while it was still dark. وَاللہ سبحانہ تعالیٰ اَعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nThe testimony of a non-Muslim about the event of Mi` raj\nIt appears in Tafsir ibn Kathir that Hafiz Abu Nu'aym al-Isbahani, in his book, Dala'il al-Nubuwwah, has reported a narrative from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi on the authority of Muhammad ibn ` Amr al-Waqidi giving details of the event as follows:\n. The Scholars of Hadith say that Al-Waqidi is weak in Hadith narrations but a cautious Muhaddith like Imam Ibn Kathir has reported his narration for the reason that this matter is not connected with ` Aqa'id or Halal and Haram and in such historical matters his narration is trustworthy - Muhammad Shafi' eager to use this occasion to say things about the Holy Prophet ﷺ which show his insignificance. But, says Abu Sufyan: Nothing stopped me from doing that except that I may slip and say something which turns out to be a lie and I stand disgraced in the eyes of the Emperor and my own comrades keep taunting me for being a liar. Certainly, then it occurred to me that I should relate the event of Mi` raj before him. The Emperor would himself conclude from it that it was a lie. So, I said: I shall describe before you what he claims to have happened to him regarding which you will yourself realize that it was a lie. Hiraql asked: What event is that? Abu Sufyan said: This claimant of prophet-hood says that, one night, he left Makkah al-Mukarramah, reached this Masjid Baytul-maqdis of yours and, then, within that night, before dawn, he returned to us in Makkah al-Mukarramah!\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ sent Sayyidna Dihyah ibn Khalifah with a blessed letter from him to the Roman Emperor, Caesar. After that, he has given a detailed account of how Sayyidna Dihyah reached the Emperor, delivered the letter, and how intelligent he was in his mission (an event present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari as well as in all trustworthy books of Hadith). Towards the end of it, it has been reported that Hiraql, the Roman Emperor, once he had read the blessed letter, ordered that all Arab traders who were visiting the country at that time should be assembled together. He wanted to investigate into the background of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . The royal order was carried out. Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and those with him visiting Syria at that time with their famous trade caravan were presented before the Emperor. Details of the questions asked by the Emperor are present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as elsewhere. Abu Sufyan was really\nAt that time, the leading scholar of Elia' (Baytul-maqdis) was standing close to Hiraql, the Roman Emperor. He disclosed that he knew that night. The Emperor turned to him and inquired as to how did he come to know about it. He submitted that, as a matter of habit, he would not sleep at night until he had closed all gates of Baytul-maqdis. That night he habitually closed all gates but one which would not close despite his effort. He summoned his staff. They all tried but they too failed to close it. The panels of the gate remained simply unmoved from their place. It seemed as if they were trying to move some mountain. Rendered helpless, he called technicians and carpenters. They looked at the gate and decided that the weight of the building has come to rest on the panels of the gate. There was no way it could be closed before morning. When morning comes, they said, they will see how this could be fixed. Nonplussed, he returned leaving both panels of the gate ajar. As soon as it was morning, he came back to the gate where he noticed that someone had made a hole in the rock close to the gate of the Masjid which gave the impression that some animal was tied down there. At that time he had told his colleagues: Perhaps, Allah Ta` ala has caused this gate not to close today because some prophet was to come here. And then, he also stated that this blessed prophet has also offered his prayer in this Masjid of ours. Thereafter, he has described further details. (Ibn Kathir, p. 24, v. 3)\nThe date of the event of a1-'Isra' and Mi` raj\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) has said in his Tafsir that the narratives of Hadith regarding the date of Mi` raj are quite different. According to Musa ibn 'Uqbah, this event came to pass six month before the Hijrah to Madinah. Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ says that Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ had passed away before the injunction making Salah a Fard (obligation) was revealed. Imam Zuhri says that the event of the sad demise of Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ took place seven years after the call to the mission of prophet-hood.\nAccording to some Hadith narratives, the event of Mi` raj happened five years after the call to prophet-hood. Ibn Ishaq says that the event of Mi` raj took place at a time when Islam had spread throughout the tribes of Arabia generally. The outcome of all these narratives is that the event of Mi` raj dates back to several years before the Hijrah to Madinah.\nAl-Harbi says that the event of al-'Isra' and Mi` raj has happened during the night of the 27th of Rabi' ath-Thani, one year before Hijrah and Ibn al-Qasim adh-Dhahabi says that it took place eighteen months after the call to prophethood. Esteemed Muhaddithin (Hadith scholars) who have mentioned these different narratives have not followed it up with any decisive statement. And as commonly known, the 27th night of the month of Rajab is the Night of Mi` raj. وَاللہ سُبحَانہ تعالیٰ اعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nAl-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Aqsa\nSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : 'Which Masjid of this world comes first?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Haram.' Then he inquired, 'Which one after that?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Aqsa.' Then he tried to find out the intervening time difference between the two whereupon he said, 'Forty years.' After that, he added, ' (as for the order of these masajid, this is it) but, Allah Ta’ ala has made the entire Earth a masjid for us. Wherever comes the time of Salah, offer it right there.' (Reported by Muslim)\nEarly Tafsir authority, Mujahid says that Allah Ta` ala has made the site of Baytullah two thousand years before He made the entire Earth and that its foundations reach as far down as the seventh (strata of) Earth and that al-Masjid al-Aqsa was made by Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) . (Reported by an-Nasa'i with sound chains of authority from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar) (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, p. 137, v. 4)\nAnd al-Masjid al-Haram is the name of the Mosque that stands around the Baytullah ash-Sharif while, on occasions, the entire Haram is also identified as al-Masjid al-Haram. In terms of this second sense, the dichotomy of those two reports - some hold that the Holy Prophet ﷺ left for the nocturnal journey, al-'Isra', from the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ while others say that he departed from the section of Baytullah known as Hatim - stands removed. If we were to take al-Masjid al-Haram in its general sense, it is not far out to believe that he may have been there in the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ first, then he walked over to the Hatim of Ka'bah and then began the journey of al-'Isra' from there. Allah knows best.\nAI-Masjid al-Aqsa and blessings of the Syrian environs\nThe word: حَول - (hawl: environs) in the verse: بارکنا حولہ (the environs of which We have blessed) means the entire land of Syria. It appears in a Hadith that Allah Ta` ala has made the land from the ` Arsh (Divine Throne) to the river, Euphrates and, out of this, He has bestowed particular holiness on the land of Palestine. (Ruh al-Maani)\nThe blessings it has are both religious and worldly. As for religious blessings, it has been the Qiblah of all past prophets, and their home, and the last resting place. And that its land is green, lush and verdant with streams, rivers and fruit farms etc. shows its worldly blessings.\nSayyidna Mu` adh ibn Jabal reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Allah Ta’ ala says: 0 land of Syria, thou art My region chosen from many and I shall make My chosen servants reach thee. (Qurtubi) And it appears in a Hadith of the Musnad of Ahmad that the Imposter will traverse the whole Earth but he will not be granted access to four Mosques: (1) Masjid of Madinah, (2) Masjid of Makkah al-Mukarramah, (3) Al-Masjid al-Aqsa and (4) Masjid Tur."

      "text": "Sequence\nAt the beginning of the Sarah, the majesty of the prophet-hood of the Messenger of Allah was described through the miracle of al-Mi` raj. The present verses cite the miracle of Qur'an as its confirmation.\nCommentary\nThe most upright way\nThe way to which the Qur'an guides has been called 'aqwam,' the most upright. 'Aqwam' can be explained by saying that it is a way that is closer to the destination, is easy and free of dangers at the same time. (Qurtubi) This tells us that the rules set for human life by the Holy Qur'an are a combination of all three features mentioned above. However, it is a different matter that man may start taking this way to be difficult or dangerous on occasions because of his own lack of comprehension. But, the Lord of all the worlds has the most comprehensive knowledge of every single particle in the entire universe. Before Him, the past and the future are the same. It is He who can have the knowledge of the reality as to the function and form most beneficial for human beings. And since man is unaware of things as they are in a comprehensive setting, he can-not identify even his own good or bad fully and decisively."

      "text": "Commentary\nThe truth of the matter about what has been said in the last verse (100) is that the treasures of the mercy of Allah are limit-less and end-less. They are never going to end, but man is by nature narrow-minded, short on courage. When it comes to giving, he is not motivated enough to share what he has with others.\nCommentators generally take the expression 'the treasures of the Lord's blessing or mercy' to mean the treasures of wealth. This has its link with previous verses (90, 91) where the disbelievers of Makkah had demanded that the Holy Prophet ﷺ should - if he was really a prophet in truth - make rivers flow in the barren desert of Makkah and trans-form it into lush green farms, like the land of Syria. The answer to this was given right there (93), saying in effect: This is as if you have taken me to be nothing short of God whose authority you want me to exercise. As for me, I am only a messenger of Allah, not Allah. I cannot do what I will. If we see this verse in this context, it would mean: If you are asking me to turn this desert land of Makkah into a green land to test my veracity as prophet and messenger, then, the miracle of the eloquence of the Qur'an is sufficient to prove that. There is no need for any other demands. And if this is to meet the needs of your country and people, remember that, even if you are given everything you demand for the land of Makkah, and all sorts of treasures with it, it would not result in the prosperity of the masses of your country. In fact, human nature will take its course and whoever gets hold of these treasures will sit on them like legendary serpents. Tell them to spend it on the people and you will see them all consumed by the fear that it will go out of their hands. In a situ-ation like this, if a few rich men of Makkah get to be richer and opulent, what are the masses of people going to get out of it? Most commentators have declared this to be the sense of the verse.\nMy master and mentor, Hadrat Thanavi (رح) ، in his Bayan al-Qur'an, has interpreted 'my Lord's mercy' as the station of prophethood and messenger-ship, and 'the treasures of mercy' as the varied perfection of prophethood. Given this Tafsir, this verse will be linked with previous verses by saying: The outcome of all those absurd demands you are making against my status as a prophet and Messenger of Allah ﷺ is that you just do not want to believe in it. Do you, then, want that the function of prophethood should be entrusted in your hands, so that you can make anyone a prophet at your sweet will? If such a wish were to be granted, the consequence would be that you would never give prophethood or messenger-ship to anyone, sitting over it like misers. After having given this explanation, he has added that this Tafsir is something that comes as one of the many divine gifts. It fits the occasion. Interpreting proph-ethood in this setting with mercy would be similar to its interpretation in the verse of Surah az-Zukhruf. It was said: أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَ‌حْمَتَ رَ‌بِّكَ (Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? - 43:32). Here, 'rahmah' (mercy) means nothing but 'nubuwwah' (prophethood) - and there is a consensus on it. Allah knows best."

Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ narrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 'a person who wept in fear of Allah shall not go to Hell until milk is returned to the udder after having been milked. (It means, as it is not possible to put milk once milked back into the udder, very similarly, it is also not possible that a person who weeps in fear of Allah were to go to Hell). And says another report, 'Allah Ta’ ala has forbidden the fire of Hell on two eyes - the eye that weeps in fear of Allah, and the eye that stays awake at nights guarding the Islamic frontiers. (Baihaqi, and Hakim) And Sayyidna Nadr ibn Sa'd ؓ reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 'a people, among whom there is someone who weeps in fear of Allah, will be delivered from the fire of Hell because of him.' (Ruh al- Ma’ ani from Tirmidhi)\nThe reason for the big trouble Muslims are in today is no other but that there are very few left among them who would weep fearing Allah. After reporting the Ahadith showing the merits of weeping in fear of Allah at this point, the author of Ruh al-Ma’ ani says: وینبغی ان یکون ذٰلَک حال العلماء (And that is the state the ` Ulama' should be in) - because, Ibn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir and others have quoted the following saying of ` Abd al-Ala Taimi:\n'A person who has received the kind of knowledge that does not make him cry [ because of having realized the reality of things ] should be enough to make you understand that he has not been given the knowledge that brings benefits.'"

      "text": "Perhaps, it is based on this congruity that it was said in verse 11 that man would, on occasions, pray for something in a haste, something that spells out destruction for him. If Allah Ta` ala were to answer such a prayer, he would be ruined. But, Allah Ta’ ala does not answer such prayers instantly until man himself comes to realize that his prayer was made in error and that it was fatal for him. Then, in the last sentence of this very verse, a natural weakness of man has been mentioned in the form of a standing rule - that man is, by nature, haste-prone. He keeps his sight trained on passing profit and loss and falls short on foresight and hindsight. He loves to go for the immediate gain and comfort, even if it happens to be only a little. He would not bat an eye to prefer it to the greater and more lasting gain and comfort. In short, this verse points out to a natural weakness of human beings in general.\nAnd some authorities in Tafsir have taken this verse to be related to a particular event. The event they refer to concerns Nadr ibn Harith who had made a prayer in the heat of his hostility to Islam saying:\nاللھُمَّ اِن کَانَ ھٰذَا ھوُالحَقَّ مِن عندِکَ فَاَمطِر عَلَینَا حِجارَۃً مَّنَ السَّمَآِء اَوأتنا بِعَذَاب اَلِیم\nO Allah, if this [ Islam ] is the truth from You, then, rain down on us rocks from the skies or send upon us some other painful punishment.\nIn that case, 'al-insan' of the text would be referring to those mentioned above, or those like them."

      "ayah": 110,
      "surah": 17,
      "text": "Commentary\nThese are the last verses of Surah Bani Isra'il (Al-'Isra' ). The Surah began with a declaration of the purity and oneness of Allah Ta’ ala, and this is how it is being concluded. The revelation of these verses was based on some events. The first one came to pass on a certain day when the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، during his supplication, said 'Ya Allah' and 'Ya Rahman.' The Mushriks thought that he was calling two Gods. They said, 'he forbids us to call anyone else other than the One while he himself calls two deities.' The answer to this comment was given in the first part of the verse by saying that the most exalted Allah does not have a mere two names. He has many more names and all of them are the best of names. Call Him by any of these and it means the One and Only Allah. So, it was made clear that their apprehensions on that count were wrong.\nAs for the second incident, when the Holy Prophet ﷺ would recite the Qur'an loudly during Salah, the Mushriks made fun of him and passed audacious remarks berating the Qur’ an, archangel Jibra'il, even Allah Ta` ala. In response to that, the last part of this very verse was revealed where he has been advised to take to a middle course between the loud and the low, as the average voice took care of the functional necessity. And as for the opportunity the Mushriks had to cause pain to them over the loud pitch of the voice, they would be relieved of that too.\nThe third problem was that the Jews and Christians proposed children for Allah Ta` ala and the pagan Arabs said that idols were partners of Allah. The Sabians and the Magians used to hold that not being particularly close to Allah amounted to a personal loss of worth and honor. In answer to these three religious groups, the last verse was revealed where their three notions have been refuted.\nIt will be noted that, in this world, the one from whom strength and support is received is sometimes younger than one, like children, and sometimes an equal, like a partner, and sometimes older than one, like a supporter and helper. Here, in this verse, Allah Ta’ ala has refuted all three in the same order.\nRuling\nThe etiquette of recitation in Salah as given in verse no is that it should not be in a voice raised very high, nor should it be in a voice so lowered that those standing behind in the congregation cannot hear it. This injunction, as obvious, is particular with prayers wherein the recitation is voiced. As for the prayers of Zuhr and ` Asr, the recitation therein is totally unvoiced as proved from uninterrupted Sunnah.\nIn prayers with voiced recitation, included there are the Fard of Maghrib, ` Isha' and Fajr, as well as the prayer of Tahajjud - as in a Hadith which says: Once the Holy Prophet ﷺ passed by Sayyidna Abu Bakr and Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ at the time of Tahajjud. Sayyidna Abu Bakr was reciting in a lowered voice while Sayyidna ` Umar was reciting in a loud voice. The Holy Prophet ﷺ said to Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، 'why would you recite in such a lowered voice?' Sayyidna Abu Bakr said, 'the One I wanted to talk to in secret, Him I have made to hear, because Allah Ta` ala hears every voice, even the lowest of the low.' The Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 'recite somewhat loudly.' Then he said to Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، 'why do you recite in such a loud voice?' Sayyidna ` Umar (رح) said, 'I recite loudly to wake up the drowsy, and shaitan.' He ordered him too, 'you should recite in a voice somewhat lowered.' (Tirmidhi as quoted Mazhari)\nProblems and their solutions relating to the loud or lowered rendering of the recitation of the Qur'an in Salah, or on occasions other than it, have been already explained in Surah al-A` raf (see commentary under Verse 55, Volume III). About the last verse beginning with: قُلِ الحَمدُ للہِ (say, 'alhamdulillah: praise belongs to Allah' ), the Hadith says that this is the 'ayah' (verse) of 'izzah' (power and glory). [ The reference is to the efficacy of the verse in seeking the help of Allah to overcome weaknesses and difficulties ]. (Reported by Abmad and at-Tabarani on the authority of Sayyidna Mu۔ adh al-Juhaniyy as in Mazhari) This verse also provides an essential guidance. The drive of the meaning is that it does not matter how much one devotes to the worship of Allah, one is still obligated to take his or her deed to be deficient as compared with His due right and confess to the likely shortfall in performing it.

Then he recited the verse:\nوَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِ‌يكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْ‌هُ تَكْبِيرً‌ا\nAnd say, \"Praise belongs to Allah who has neither taken to Him a son, nor is there any partner to Him in His kingdom, nor is anyone [ needed ] to protect Him because of [ any ] weak-ness. And proclaim His greatness, an open proclamation\" - 111). (Mazhari)\nAnd Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ has said that once he went out with the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، in a manner that his hand was in Holy Prophet ﷺ 's hands. He passed by a person who was disheveled and worried. He asked, 'what brought you to this condition?' That person said, 'sickness and poverty have done this to me.' He said, 'I am going to tell you a few words. If you recite these, your sickness and poverty will go away. The words were:\nوَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِ‌يكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْ‌هُ تَكْبِيرً‌ا\nI place my trust in the Ever Living who is not to die. Praise be-longs to Allah who has neither taken to Him a son, nor is there any partner to Him in His kingdom, nor is anyone (needed) to protect Him because of (any) weakness. And proclaim His greatness, an open proclamation. (17:111)\nAfter the passage of some time, when he went that way, he found his condition good and showed his pleasure about it. That person told him, 'since the time you taught me these words, I recite them punctually.' (Abu Ya'la and Ibn al-Sunni, as quoted by Mazhari)\nThe Tafslr of Surah Bani Isra’ i1 ends here\nWith the help of Allah\nAfter al-` Isha, Jumada I, 1390 Hijrah\nPraised be Allah, from the beginning to the end.\nA personal postscript by the author\nWhile writing these lines, this humble servant of Allah has completed full seventy five years of his age on 21 Sha` ban, 1390 Hijrah. Year seventy-six opens amidst diseases of different kinds including the natural weakness that sets in at this age. Then there is the mass of things to do and problems to resolve. Who can look forward to the task of writing beyond this point for it would be hoping against hope. But, when it comes to the service of the Qur'an things become different. When some-one does something in the name of the Qur’ an, no matter how insignificant, it becomes for a servant of Allah a matter of good fortune and honour. This thought led me to begin the Tafsir of Surah al-Kahf with the name of Allah. The idea was to take whatever it was possible to do during the years of life left as sufficient and good enough, because the purpose is not to finish the Qur'an, the purpose is to consume one's years and energy into the Qur'an. And Allah is the Over of ability and the helper of the effort made in His way.\n(Abridged from the detailed note)"

Then it was said that there was great wisdom in the making of the night dark and the day, bright. As for the wise consideration behind the making of the night dark, it was not mentioned at this place. It has, however, been mentioned in other verses that the darkness of the night is appropriate and conducive to sleep and rest. The divine arrangement is such that humans and animals go to sleep in the darkness of that very night. In fact, the whole world sleeps simultaneously in harmony with its night. Had different people been scheduled to sleep at different timings, the noises made by those awake and those working at jobs would have turned the sleep of the sleeping into a nightmare.\nAs for the day being bright, it has two elements of wisdom. Firstly, one can earn his living in the light of the day and natural light is needed for jobs, businesses and industries. Secondly, the alternation of night and day helps one know the number of years, for instance, the completion of three hundred and sixty days tells us that a full year has gone by.\nSimilarly, other calculations are also related to the alternation of night and day. If this variation of night and day were not there, it would have been difficult to fix the wages of the wage earner, the employment of the employee and the time duration of transactions."

There are other leading jurists who hold that those who deny the Islamic beliefs that can be understood through reason - such as, the existence of God and His Oneness etc. - will be punished for their disbelief, even if no call from any prophet or messenger has reached them. Of course, there will be no punishment for usual acts of disobedience and sins without prior call and transmission of the divine message by prophets. And there are still others who interpret 'rasul' at this place (15) in a general sense, whether he is a messenger or prophet, or whether it is the human reason itself - for, that too, in a way, is a messenger of Allah after all.\nThere will be no punishment for the children of Mushriks\nCommenting on the verse: لَا تَزِرُ‌ وَازِرَ‌ةٌ (And no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another - 15), it has been said in Tafsir Mazhari that this verse proves that the children of Mushriks and disbelievers who die before reaching adulthood will not be punished. The reason is that they will not deserve to be punished on account of the denial and disbelief of their parents. Sayings of leading jurists differ about this issue; its de-tails are unnecessary here."

The answer is that Allah Ta’ ala has given man reason and choice and has determined the ways of reward and punishment.

The outcome of the second qira'ah is that the number of such people is increased in that society. Both versions show that the government of the 'affluent' or the abundance of such people in a society is not something to be happy about, rather, is a sign of divine punishment.\nLet us recapitulate.

      "text": "Commentary\nTwo behavior models of human beings appear in the cited verses side by side. As for those who elect to go for the readily available benefits out of their life in this world, and the punishment that comes in its wake, the words used were: مَّن كَانَ يُرِ‌يدُ الْعَاجِلَةَ (Whoever opts for the immediate life herein - 18). These words signify continuity and permanence meaning that this punishment of Hell will materialize only when one's actions are all the time motivated by material interests only, having practically no concern for the Hereafter. And as for 'those who desire to have the Here-after and its rewards,' the words used were: أَرَ‌ادَ الْآخِرَ‌ةَ ۔ The sense is that as soon as a true believer were to form an intention to have the reward of the Hereafter in whatever he proposes to do, that deed of his shall stand accepted - irrespective of any corruptive element having entered into something else he was intending to do.\nThe first condition can only be that of a denier of the Hereafter, therefore, none of his deeds is acceptable. Then, the second condition is that of a true believer. A particular deed by him that issues forth with sincerity of intention, and is for the Hereafter - along with the presence of other conditions - shall be acceptable. And a deed even from the same person, a deed that has no sincerity, or where other conditions are missing, will not be acceptable."

Instead, the only deed or effort credible is that which is appropriate to the essential objective (of the Hereafter). And whether or not it is appropriate can only be found out from the statement of Allah Ta’ ala and His Messenger ﷺ . Therefore, even well meaning efforts made by insisting on bland personal opinion and self-invented ways - which includes common customs of Bid'ah (innovations in established religion) - no matter how good and beneficial they may appear at their face, but are not appropriate to the effort made for the Hereafter. Consequently, they are neither acceptable with Allah nor are they of any use in the Hereafter.\nExplaining the word: سَعْيَهَا (as due), Tafsir Ruh al-Ma’ ani says that the 'effort' should be in accordance with 'sunnah.' Along with it, it adds that this effort or deed should also have uprightness and firmness. In other words, this deed should be beneficial in accordance with the Sunnah as well as it should be upright and constant. Doing it haphazardly or doing it in a cycle of doing and not doing is not good. It never yields the maximum benefit."

      "text": "Commentary\nDescribed in this verse is the event of Mi` raj (the Ascent to the heavens, or al-'Isra', the midnight journey of the Holy Prophet ﷺ which is a signal honor and distinctive miracle of our Messenger of Allah ﷺ). The word: أَسْرَ‌ىٰ (asra) is a derivation from: اِسْرَ‌ىٰ (isra' ) which literally means to make someone travel at night. After that, the introduction of the word: لَيْلًا (lailan) also makes this sense very clear. Then, by placing this word as a common noun, the indication released was that during this event the time spent was that of a part of the night - not even that of the whole night. The journey from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa mentioned in this verse is called al-'Isra' and the name of the journey from here to the seven heavens is al-Mi` raj. Isra' stands proved under the definitive textual authority of this verse and the Mi` raj finds mention in the verses of Surah an-Najm and is proved by Ahadith appearing in an uninterrupted succession. The word: بِعَبْدِهِ (bi'abdihi: His servant) used here for the Holy Prophet ﷺ is special. It shows that, in this magnificent setting of honor and welcome, when Allah Ta’ ala, on His own, elects to call someone His servant', a unique bond of love lies embedded therein and that this is the highest honor any man could ever have.\nThis is similar to what has been said in another verse: عِبَادُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ الَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ هَوْنًا (and the servants of Ar-Rahman [ the Most Merciful ] are those who walk on the Earth gently - al-Furqan, 25:63) where the objective is to increase the prestige of those who are acceptable with Him. From here, we also learn that the highest achievement man is capable of is to become a perfect servant of Allah - for, on this eve of special honour, the quality of ideal servitude, out of his many attributes of perfection, was chosen. Then, the presence of this expression yields yet another beneficial outcome in that no one gets the wrong impression of divinity from this wonderful journey by night which, from its beginning to the end, is full of extra-habitual miracles. This is something like what happened with the Christians who fell into deception over the event of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) being raised unto the heavens. For this reason, by saying - ('abd: servant), it was declared that, despite all those attributes, achievements and miracles, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was still a servant of Allah, not god.\nThe Qur'an, Sunnah and 'Ijma' prove that the Mi` raj was physical.\nIt is proved from the text of the Holy Qur'an, and from Ahadith coming in uninterrupted succession mentioned later that the entire journey of the Isra' and Mi` raj was not simply spiritual, instead, it was physical - like the journey of anyone else. The very first word of the Holy Qur'an in this Surah: سُبحَانَ (Subhan: Pure is He! ) carries a hint in this direction because this word is used to register wonder or introduce a great marvel. Had the Mi` raj been merely spiritual, just a matter of dream, what was there so unusual about it? As for a dream, every Muslim, even every human being, can see it and report that he or she went to the heavens, did this and did that.\nThe second indication embedded in the word: عَبد ('abd: servant) also points out in the same direction because ` abd is no spirit all by itself, instead, it is the name of the combination of body and spirit.\nIn addition to that, when the Holy Prophet \tﷺ related the event of Mi` raj to Sayyidah Umm Hani ؓ ، she advised him not to mention it before anyone otherwise people would falsify it even more. Had this been the matter of a dream, what was there in it that needed to be falsified?\nAfter that, when he did tell people about it, the disbelievers of Makkah called it a lie and made fun of him, so much so that some neo-Muslims became apostates (murtadd) after hearing the news. If this would have been the matter of a dream, the likelihood of such reactions was least warranted. And that he had experienced some spiritual Mi` raj in the form of a dream, before this or after that, does not become contrary to it. According to the majority of Muslim scholars, the word: الرُّ‌ؤْيَا (ar-ru'ya) in the verse of the Qur'an: وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّ‌ؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَ‌يْنَاكَ (And We showed you the scene - 17:60) means: رُؤیۃ (ruyah: seeing). But, it has been expressed through the word: رؤیا (ru۔ ya, which is frequently used in the sense of seeing a dream). The reason for this expression could be that this thing has been called ru'ya in the sense of a simile. This is like someone seeing a dream. And if, ru’ ya is taken to mean dream itself, then, it is also not too far out to say that the event of Mi` raj, in addition to its being physical, also transpired, before or after it, in the form of a spiritual Mi` raj as a dream as well. Therefore, the saying, that it was a dream, reported from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ is also correct in its place - but, it does not necessarily imply that physical Mi` raj did not take place.\nIt appears in Tafsir al-Qurtubi that the Ahadith relating to the event of al-Isra' are recurrent and uninterrupted. Naqqash has reported related narratives from twenty Sahabah of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then, Qadi 'Iyad has given additional details in Al-Shifa' (Qurtubi).\nIrnam Ibn Kathir (رح) has, in his Tafsir, reported all these narratives and after applying the standard rules of scrutiny has mentioned the names of twentyfive Sahabah from whom these reports come. Their names are:\n1.\tSayyidna ` Umar ibn al-Khattab,\n2.\tSayyidna 'Ali al-Murtada,\n3.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud,\n4.\tSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari,\n5.\tSayyidna Malik ibn Sa` sa` ah,\n6.\tSayyidna Abu Hurairah,\n7.\tSayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri,\n8.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas,\n9.\tSayyidna Shaddad ibn Aws,\n10.\tSayyidna Ubaiyy ibn Ka'b,\n11.\tSayyidna ` Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Quraz,\n12.\tSayyidna Abu Hayyah (اَبُو حیہ),\n13.\tSayyidna Abu Laila,\n14.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar,\n15.\tSayyidna Jabir ibn ` Abdullah,\n16.\tSayyidna Hudhayfah ibn Yaman,\n17.\tSayyidna Buraidah,\n18.\tSayyidna Abu Ayyut al-Ansari,\n19.\tSayyidna Abu 'Umamah,\n20.\tSayyidna Samurah ibn Jundub,\n21.\tSayyidna Abu al-Hamra',\n22.\tSayyidna Suhayb al-Rumi,\n23.\tSayyidah Umm Hani',\n24.\tUmm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah,\n25.\tSayyidah Asma' bint Abi Bakr, After that, Ibn Kathir said:\nفَحدِیث الاسراِء اجمع علیہ المسلمون و اعرض عنہ الزنادقۃ و الملحدون (ابن کثیر)\nAs for the Hadith of al-Isra', there is a consensus of all Muslim on it. Only heretics and atheists have denied it. (Ibn Kathir)\nA brief account of Mi` raj - as reported by Ibn Kathir\nAfter having explained the present verse in his Tafsir along with a detailed background of relevant Ahadith, Imam Ibn Kathir (رح) has said: The truth of the matter is that the journey of Isra' came to pass when the Holy Prophet ﷺ was awake, not dreaming. From Makkah al-Mukarramah to Baitulmaqdis, the journey was covered on buraq (a special heavenly horse to ride). When he reached the gate of Baitulmaqdis, he tied the buraq close to the gate, entered the Masjid of Baitulmaqdis and offered two rak’ at of Tahiyyatul-masjid (prayer in honor of the Mosque) facing its orientation. After that, a staircase was brought which had steps to go up from below. Through this staircase, he went to the first heaven. After that, he went to the rest of the heavens. [ Only Allah knows the reality of this staircase - what it was and how did it work and things like that. In our day too, many kinds of stairs are in use. There are stairs that escalate automatically and there are elevators that take one up. Therefore, falling into any doubt or suspicion about this miraculous staircase is not right.] On every heaven, the resident angels greeted him and on every heaven, he met blessed prophets who were stationed on a particular heaven, such as, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) on the sixth heaven, and Sayyidna Ibrahim Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) on the seventh heaven. After that, he went beyond the stations of all these blessed prophets and reached a plain where he could hear the sound of the pen writing destinies. And he saw the Sidratul-muntaha, the Far Tree in Jannah, on which moths in gold and variegated colors were falling from above by the command of Allah and which was surrounded by angels of Allah. And it was at this place that the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw Sayyidna Jibra` il al-Amin in his real form with six hundred wings. And right there, he saw a flag in green that had the horizon all covered up. And he also saw al-Bayt al-Ma` mur (the well-attended House believed to be located in Jannah exactly above the Baytullah in Makkah) sitting by which was the founder of the Ka'bah, Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) with his back reclining against its wall. Seventy thousand angels enter this Bayt al-Ma` mur every day who shall be waiting for their turn to re-enter there right through the day of Qiyamah. And the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw the Jannah and the Jahannam with his own blessed eyes. At that time, first came the command that his people were being obligated with fifty prayers, then, these were reduced to five. This shows the importance and merit of Salah as being the foremost out of all acts of ` Ibadah.\nAfter that, he alighted back into Baytul-maqdis and, with him, so did the blessed prophets he had met on different heavens (as if) they had come to see him off as far as Baytul-maqdis. At that time, as it was time for Salah, he offered the prayer with all prophets. It is also probable that this Salah was the Salah of Fajr the same day. Ibn Kathir says that this event concerning the prayer with prophets led by the Holy Prophet ﷺ has come to pass, as held by some, before he went to the heavens. But, as obvious, this event took place after the return because it has been reported in the incident relating to his meeting with blessed prophets at different heavens that it was Sayyidna Jibra'il who introduced him to all prophets. Had this event relating to his leading the prayer passed earlier, no introduction was needed there - and, for that matter, it is obvious enough that the real purpose of this journey was to visit with the heavenly hosts. Doing that first appears to be more likely. Once he was done with the real mission, all prophets came to say good bye to him up to Baytul-maqdis and by making him the Imam of the prayer through a signal from Sayyidna Jibra'il, his precedence over others was demonstrated practically.\nAfter that, he departed from Baytul-maqdis riding buraq and reached Makkah al-Mu` azzamah while it was still dark. وَاللہ سبحانہ تعالیٰ اَعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nThe testimony of a non-Muslim about the event of Mi` raj\nIt appears in Tafsir ibn Kathir that Hafiz Abu Nu'aym al-Isbahani, in his book, Dala'il al-Nubuwwah, has reported a narrative from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi on the authority of Muhammad ibn ` Amr al-Waqidi giving details of the event as follows:\n. The Scholars of Hadith say that Al-Waqidi is weak in Hadith narrations but a cautious Muhaddith like Imam Ibn Kathir has reported his narration for the reason that this matter is not connected with ` Aqa'id or Halal and Haram and in such historical matters his narration is trustworthy - Muhammad Shafi' eager to use this occasion to say things about the Holy Prophet ﷺ which show his insignificance. But, says Abu Sufyan: Nothing stopped me from doing that except that I may slip and say something which turns out to be a lie and I stand disgraced in the eyes of the Emperor and my own comrades keep taunting me for being a liar. Certainly, then it occurred to me that I should relate the event of Mi` raj before him. The Emperor would himself conclude from it that it was a lie. So, I said: I shall describe before you what he claims to have happened to him regarding which you will yourself realize that it was a lie. Hiraql asked: What event is that? Abu Sufyan said: This claimant of prophet-hood says that, one night, he left Makkah al-Mukarramah, reached this Masjid Baytul-maqdis of yours and, then, within that night, before dawn, he returned to us in Makkah al-Mukarramah!\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ sent Sayyidna Dihyah ibn Khalifah with a blessed letter from him to the Roman Emperor, Caesar. After that, he has given a detailed account of how Sayyidna Dihyah reached the Emperor, delivered the letter, and how intelligent he was in his mission (an event present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari as well as in all trustworthy books of Hadith). Towards the end of it, it has been reported that Hiraql, the Roman Emperor, once he had read the blessed letter, ordered that all Arab traders who were visiting the country at that time should be assembled together. He wanted to investigate into the background of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . The royal order was carried out. Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and those with him visiting Syria at that time with their famous trade caravan were presented before the Emperor. Details of the questions asked by the Emperor are present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as elsewhere. Abu Sufyan was really\nAt that time, the leading scholar of Elia' (Baytul-maqdis) was standing close to Hiraql, the Roman Emperor. He disclosed that he knew that night. The Emperor turned to him and inquired as to how did he come to know about it. He submitted that, as a matter of habit, he would not sleep at night until he had closed all gates of Baytul-maqdis. That night he habitually closed all gates but one which would not close despite his effort. He summoned his staff. They all tried but they too failed to close it. The panels of the gate remained simply unmoved from their place. It seemed as if they were trying to move some mountain. Rendered helpless, he called technicians and carpenters. They looked at the gate and decided that the weight of the building has come to rest on the panels of the gate. There was no way it could be closed before morning. When morning comes, they said, they will see how this could be fixed. Nonplussed, he returned leaving both panels of the gate ajar. As soon as it was morning, he came back to the gate where he noticed that someone had made a hole in the rock close to the gate of the Masjid which gave the impression that some animal was tied down there. At that time he had told his colleagues: Perhaps, Allah Ta` ala has caused this gate not to close today because some prophet was to come here. And then, he also stated that this blessed prophet has also offered his prayer in this Masjid of ours. Thereafter, he has described further details. (Ibn Kathir, p. 24, v. 3)\nThe date of the event of a1-'Isra' and Mi` raj\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) has said in his Tafsir that the narratives of Hadith regarding the date of Mi` raj are quite different. According to Musa ibn 'Uqbah, this event came to pass six month before the Hijrah to Madinah. Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ says that Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ had passed away before the injunction making Salah a Fard (obligation) was revealed. Imam Zuhri says that the event of the sad demise of Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ took place seven years after the call to the mission of prophet-hood.\nAccording to some Hadith narratives, the event of Mi` raj happened five years after the call to prophet-hood. Ibn Ishaq says that the event of Mi` raj took place at a time when Islam had spread throughout the tribes of Arabia generally. The outcome of all these narratives is that the event of Mi` raj dates back to several years before the Hijrah to Madinah.\nAl-Harbi says that the event of al-'Isra' and Mi` raj has happened during the night of the 27th of Rabi' ath-Thani, one year before Hijrah and Ibn al-Qasim adh-Dhahabi says that it took place eighteen months after the call to prophethood. Esteemed Muhaddithin (Hadith scholars) who have mentioned these different narratives have not followed it up with any decisive statement. And as commonly known, the 27th night of the month of Rajab is the Night of Mi` raj. وَاللہ سُبحَانہ تعالیٰ اعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nAl-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Aqsa\nSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : 'Which Masjid of this world comes first?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Haram.' Then he inquired, 'Which one after that?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Aqsa.' Then he tried to find out the intervening time difference between the two whereupon he said, 'Forty years.' After that, he added, ' (as for the order of these masajid, this is it) but, Allah Ta’ ala has made the entire Earth a masjid for us. Wherever comes the time of Salah, offer it right there.' (Reported by Muslim)\nEarly Tafsir authority, Mujahid says that Allah Ta` ala has made the site of Baytullah two thousand years before He made the entire Earth and that its foundations reach as far down as the seventh (strata of) Earth and that al-Masjid al-Aqsa was made by Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) . (Reported by an-Nasa'i with sound chains of authority from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar) (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, p. 137, v. 4)\nAnd al-Masjid al-Haram is the name of the Mosque that stands around the Baytullah ash-Sharif while, on occasions, the entire Haram is also identified as al-Masjid al-Haram. In terms of this second sense, the dichotomy of those two reports - some hold that the Holy Prophet ﷺ left for the nocturnal journey, al-'Isra', from the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ while others say that he departed from the section of Baytullah known as Hatim - stands removed. If we were to take al-Masjid al-Haram in its general sense, it is not far out to believe that he may have been there in the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ first, then he walked over to the Hatim of Ka'bah and then began the journey of al-'Isra' from there. Allah knows best.\nAI-Masjid al-Aqsa and blessings of the Syrian environs\nThe word: حَول - (hawl: environs) in the verse: بارکنا حولہ (the environs of which We have blessed) means the entire land of Syria. It appears in a Hadith that Allah Ta` ala has made the land from the ` Arsh (Divine Throne) to the river, Euphrates and, out of this, He has bestowed particular holiness on the land of Palestine. (Ruh al-Maani)\nThe blessings it has are both religious and worldly. As for religious blessings, it has been the Qiblah of all past prophets, and their home, and the last resting place. And that its land is green, lush and verdant with streams, rivers and fruit farms etc. shows its worldly blessings.\nSayyidna Mu` adh ibn Jabal reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Allah Ta’ ala says: 0 land of Syria, thou art My region chosen from many and I shall make My chosen servants reach thee. (Qurtubi) And it appears in a Hadith of the Musnad of Ahmad that the Imposter will traverse the whole Earth but he will not be granted access to four Mosques: (1) Masjid of Madinah, (2) Masjid of Makkah al-Mukarramah, (3) Al-Masjid al-Aqsa and (4) Masjid Tur."

      "text": "Commentary\nIt is very important to respect and obey parents\nImam al-Qurtubi says that, in this verse (23), Allah Ta` ala has made it necessary (wajib) to respect and treat parents well by combining it with the command to worship Him. This is similar to what has been said in Surah Luqman where the inevitable need to thank Him has been combined with the need to thank one's parents: أَنِ اشْكُرْ‌ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ (Be grateful to Me, and to your parents - 31:14). This proves that, after the obligation of worshipping the most exalted Allah, obeying parents is most important and being grateful to parents like being grateful to Allah Ta’ ala is wajib (necessary). This has its confirmation in the Hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari where a person reportedly asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ \"Which is the most favoured deed in the sight of Allah?\" He said, \"Salah at its (mustahabb: preferred) time.\" The person asked again, \"Which is the most favoured deed after that?\" To that he said, \"Treating parents well.\" (Qurtubi)\nThe merits of obeying and serving parents in Ilad! th narratives\n1.\tIn the Musnad of Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Mustadrak Hakim, it has been reported on sound authority from Sayyidna Abu ` d-Darda' that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"A father is the main gate of Jannah. Now it is up to you to preserve or waste it.\" (Mazhari)\n2.\tAccording to a report from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar ؓ appearing in Jmi' al-Tirmidhi and al-Mustadrak of al-Hakim (which Hakim rates as Sahih), the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"The pleasure of Allah is in the pleasure of a father and the displeasure of Allah in the displeasure of a father.\"\n3.\tIbn Majah reports on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Umamah that a person asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : \"What rights do parents have on their children?\" He said, \"They both are your Paradise, or Hell.\" It means that obeying and serving parents take one to Jannah and their disobedience and displeasure, to Jahannam.\n4.\tAl-Baihaqi (in Shu'ab al-'Iman) and Ibn ` Asakir have reported on the authority of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"For one who remained obedient to his parents for the sake of Allah two gates of Paradise shall remain open. And for one who disobeyed them two gates of Hell shall remain open, and if he had just one of the two, either father or mother, then, one gate (of Paradise or Hell shall remain open).\" Thereupon, someone asked, \"Does it (the warning of Hell) hold good even when the parents have been unjust to this person?\" Then he said thrice: وَ اِن ظَلَمَا وَ اِن ظَلَمَا وَ اِن ظَلَمَا which means, 'yes, there is that warning of Hell against disobeying and hurting parents even if they were unjust to the son.' (The outcome is that children have no right to settle scores with parents. If they have been unjust, it does not follow that they too back out from obeying and serving them).\n5.\tAl-Baihaqi has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"An obedient son who looks at his parents with mercy and affection receives the reward of one accepted Hajj against every such look cast.\" People around said, \"What if he were to look at them like that a hundred times during the day?\" He said, \"Yes, a hundred times too (he will keep receiving that reward). Allah is great (His treasures never run short).\"\nThe punishment for depriving parents of their rights comes - much before Akhirah - right here in this world too\n6.\tIn Shu'ab al-'Iman, al-Baihaqi has reported on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Bakrah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"As for all those other sins, Allah Ta` ala defers whichever He wills up to the Last Day of Qiyamah - except the sin of depriving parents of their rights and disobeying them. The punishment for that is given, much before comes the Hereafter, right here in this world as well. (All Hadith reports given here have been taken from Tafsir Mazhari)\nObedience to parents: When necessary and when there is room for opposition\nMuslim scholars and jurists unanimously hold that the obedience to parents is wajib (necessary) only in what is permissible - and definitely not in what is impermissible or sinful. Says the Hadith:\nلا طاعۃ لمخلوق فی معصیۃ الخالق\nThere is no obedience to the created in the disobedience of the Creator.\nTo deserve service and good treatment it is not necessary that the parents be Muslims\nTo support this ruling, Imam al-Qurtubi has quoted an event related with Sayyidah Asma' ؓ from the Sahih of al-Bukhari. According to this report, Sayyidah Asma' asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، \"My mother, a Mushrik, comes to see me. Is it permissible for me to entertain her?\" He said,\" صِلَی اُمَّکِ \" (sili ummaki: that is, respect the bond of relationship with your mother and entertain her). And as for disbelieving parents, there is that statement of the Qur'an itself (Luqman, 31:15): صَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُ‌وفًا (that is, if the parents of a person are kafirs and order him too to be-come like them, then, it is not permissible to obey them in this matter. But, while living in this world, they should be treated in the recognized manner). It is obvious that 'recognized manner' means that they should be treated with courtesy.\nRulings\n1.\tAs long as Jihad does not become an absolute individual obligation (Fard al-` Ain), rather remains within the degree of a collective obligation (Fard al-Kifayah), until then, it is not permissible for any son to participate in Jihad without the consent of parents. It has been reported in Sahih al-Bukhari on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar ؓ that a person presented himself before the Holy Prophet ﷺ in order to have his permission to participate in Jihad. He asked him, \"Are your parents alive?\" He submitted, \"Yes, they are.\" He said, \" فَفِیھِمَا فَجَاھد \" (fafihima fajahid: Then you carry out Jihad in [ the service of ] them both). The sense is that 'by serving them alone you will get the reward of being in Jihad.' Another report also adds that the person said, \"I have come here leaving my parents crying behind.\" Thereupon, he said, \"Go. Make them laugh as you made them cry.\" In other words, he was to go back home and tell his parents that he would not be going for Jihad without their consent. (Qurtubi)\n2.\tFrom the event reported above, we learn the ruling that anything that rates as a collective obligation - and is not an individual obligation, or necessity - then, sons and daughters cannot do that without the permission of parents. Also included here is the injunction to acquire the most perfect knowledge of religion (the 'ilm of din) at the highest level, and to travel to communicate and promote it (the tabligh of din). It means that anyone who has the knowledge of religion to the measure one is obligated with individually cannot travel in order to become an ` alim of din (scholar of religion), or travel for the da'wah and tabligh of din, for it is not permissible without the permission of parents.\n3.\tAlso included under the injunction of treating parents well appearing in the Qur'an, and Hadith is good treatment with relatives and friends close to parents, specially when they are dead. In the Sahih of al-Bukhari, it has been reported from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, The noblest regard one can show to a father after his death is to treat his friends well.\" And Sayyidna Abu Usayd al-Badri\tرضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہ reports that he was sitting with the Holy Prophet ﷺ when an Ansari came and asked, \"Ya Rasulallah, is it that some right of my parents remains due against me even after they have died?\" He said, \"Yes. Praying and seeking forgiveness for them, fulfilling the promises they had made to someone, being kind and respectful to their friends and showing mercy and generosity to such relatives who are linked in kinship only through them (Silatu 'r-rahim). These are the rights of your parents still due against you, even after them.\"\nIt was the blessed habit of the Holy Prophet ﷺ that he used to send gifts to lady friends of Ummal-Mu'minin Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ after her demise which was a way of fulfilling the right of Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ on him.\nTreating parents well: Special consideration in their old age\nAs for serving and obeying parents, as parents, it is not restricted to any given time or age. In fact, it is necessary (wajib) to treat parents well, under all conditions, and in every age. But, there are circumstances that usually impede the fulfillment of what is necessary and obligatory. Under these circumstances, the typical response pattern of the Holy Qur'an comes into action to suggest ways and means through which acting according to given injunctions becomes easy. With this objective in sight, it grooms and trains minds through different angles and, at the same time, it continues to emphasize that compliance of these injunctions is imperative despite such circumstances.\nThe old age of parents, when they become helpless, depend on children for everything they need and their life is at the mercy of children, is a terrible condition to be in. The slightest indifference shown by children at such a time breaks their heart. Then, there are those physical infirmities and diseases associated with old age which make one naturally irritation-prone. Furthermore, during the period of extreme old age, when usual reason and comprehension do not seem to be working, some of their wishes and demands assume the kind of proportions which children find difficult to take care of. The Holy Qur'an takes cognizance of these circumstances, but, while giving children the instruction to comfort them, it reminds them of their own childhood. It tells them that there was a time when they too were far more helpless, far too depending on their parents than their parents were on them at that point of time. Then, was it not that their parents sacrificed their desires and comforts for them and went on bearing by the unreasonable child talk with love and affection. Now when they have become so helpless, reason and nobility demanded that the past favour done by them should be paid back. When it was said: كَمَا رَ‌بَّيَانِي صَغِيرً‌ا (as they have brought me up in my child-hood) in the verse, this is what has been alluded to. Some other important instructions relating to the old age of parents have also been given in the verses under study. They are as follows:\n1.\tDo not say even 'uff to them. Briefly explained parenthetically in the accompanying translation as 'a word of anger or contempt,' 'uff covers every word or expression that shows one's displeasure. The limit is that breathing a long breath after having heard what they said and thereby betraying displeasure against them is also included under this very word 'uff.' In a Hadith narrated by Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ ، it has been reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Had there been some other de-gree of hurting lesser than the saying of 'uff,' that too would have certainly been mentioned.\" (The sense is that even the thing that hurts parents in the lowest of the low degree is forbidden).\n2.\tDo not scold them: وَلَا تَنْهَرْ‌هُمَا . This is the second instruction. The word: نھر (nahr) in the text: means 'scold' or 'reproach.' That it causes pain in already obvious.\n3.\tAddress them with respectable words - (وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلًا كَرِ‌يمًا). This is the third instruction. The first two instructions related to the negative aspects where bringing the least emotional pressure on parents has been prohibited. Given in this third instruction is a lesson in the art of conversation with parents - talk to them softly with love, grace and concern for them. Says the revered Tabi` i, Said ibn Mussaiyyab, ' like a slave talking to his strict master!'"

      "text": "4. \tSubmit yourself before them in humility out of compassion - (وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّ‌حْمَةِ ). This is the fourth instruction. The word: جناح (janah) in the text literally means 'wings' or 'sides of arms' lending the sense that one should stand in a stance of submission and humility as a mark of respect for parents. The addition of the expression: مِنَ الرَّ‌حْمَةِ (out of com-passion) at the end of the sentence is there to warn that this stance of grace should not be a mere show-off, instead, it should be adopted on the strong foundation of genuine, heartfelt respect and compassion for them. Perhaps, this may also be suggestive of something else as well - that showing humility before parents is practically no disgrace. In fact, it is a prelude to real honour for it is based on concern, compassion and kindness.\n5. And say, \"My Lord, be merciful to them\" - (وَقُل رَّ‌بِّ ارْ‌حَمْهُمَا). It means, as for the effort to provide maximum comfort for parents, it is humanly not possible. One should do whatever it is possible for him to do in order that they remain comfortable and, then, along with it, he should also keep praying before Allah Ta` ala that He, in His infinite mercy, removes all their difficulties and makes things easy on them. This last instruction is really so extensive and universal that it still continues to be valid and beneficial even after the death of parents. Through this, one can al-ways keep serving parents.\nRuling\nIf parents are Muslims, making a prayer for mercy in their favor is obvious. But, if they are not Muslims, making this prayer within their lifetime will be permissible with the intention that they be delivered from worldly distress and that they be blessed with the taufiq of 'Iman. After their death, making a prayer of mercy for them is not permissible. (Abridged from al-Qurtubi)\nA remarkable event\nAl-Qurtubi has reported from Sayyidna Jabir ibn ` Abdullah ؓ that a man came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and complained that his father was taking away what belonged to him. He said, \"Go and ask your father to come here.\" Right then, came Sayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) and told the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، \"When his father comes, ask him about the words he has composed in his heart and which his own ears have not heard yet.\" When this man returned with his father, he said to the father, \"Why is it that your son complains against you? Do you wish to take away what belongs to him?\" The father said, \"You better ask him on whom do I spend other than his paternal or maternal aunts or myself?\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: اِیہ (an expression which denoted that he had understood the reality and there was no need to say anything else). After that, he asked the father of the man, \"What are those words that have not yet been heard by your own ears?\" The father said, \"Ya Rasulallah, Allah Ta` ala increases our faith in you through everything.\" Thereby he meant that he got to know what was not heard by anyone, which was a miracle indeed. Then, he submitted, \"It is true that I had composed some lines of poetry within my heart, something not heard even by my own ears.\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Let us hear them.\" Then he recited the following lines of poetry he had composed:\nغَذَوتُکَ مَولوداً وَ مُنتُکَ یافعا\nتُعَلُّ بِمَا اَجنِی عَلَیکَ وَ تُنھَل\nI fed you in childhood and took care of you when young. You lived on my earnings alone.\nاِذَا لیلۃ ضافتک بالسقم لم ابت\nلسقمک الا ساھرا اتململ\nWhen on some night, you became sick, I spent the whole night remaining awake and restless because of your sickness\nکَأنّی انا المطروق دونک بالذی\nطُرِقتَ بہ دونی فعینی تھمل\nAs if your sickness was my own and not yours and because of which my eyes kept shedding tears throughout the night\nتخَاف الردٰی نفسی علیک وانھا\nلَتَعَلَم ان الموتَ وَقتُ مؤجَّل\nMy heart kept trembling lest something happens to you, though I knew that the time of death is fixed, being neither early nor late\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغتَ السِنَّ والغایۃ الَّتِی\nالیھا مدی ما کنت فیک اُؤمّل\nSo, when you reached the age and maturity that I had always been looking forward to you\nجعلت جزأی غلظۃً وفظاظۃ\nکَانک اٌنت المنعم المتفضِّل\nThen you made hard-heartedness and harshness my return as if you were the one doing me favours and giving me rewards\nفلیتکَ اذ لم ترع حقَّ اُبوّتی\nفعلتَ کما الجارُ المصاقب یفعل\nAlas, if it was not possible for you to fulfill my right as a father, you could have at the least done what a good neighbor would have done\nفَاَولَیتنِی حَقَّ الجِوارِ ولم تکن\nعلیَّ بمال دون مالک تَبخَل\nSo, you could have given me the least right of a neighbor and abstained from becoming miserly in my case in my own property.\nAfter having heard these verses of poetry, the Holy Prophet ﷺ held the son by his shirt and said, \" اَنت و مَالک لابیک \" meaning that: Go. You and your property, everything belongs to your father. (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, p. 246, v. 10) These verses have also been reported in Hamasah, the famous book of Arabic literature as attributed to the poet, Umaiyyah ibn Abi as-Sult. Others say that Abd al-A’ la wrote them. Still others attribute them to Abu al-Abbas al-A'ma. (Al-Qurtubi, marginal notes)"

They have to live with parents all the time. Then, living conditions of the parties vary. They do not stay the same all the time. May be, on some such occasion, they happen to utter something, something that turns out to be against the norms of due etiquette, then, they stand facing the warning of Hell. Given this probability, it would be-come extremely difficult for them to wriggle out from this situation. In this verse, it is to remove this doubt and heart-burning that it was said: Should any such word come to be uttered out of sheer anxiety or lack of discretion - but, without intentional disrespectfulness - then, one must repent and resolve not to do that ever again. If so, since Allah Ta` ala knows the secrets of hearts and knows what was uttered was not to show disrespect or hurt, things will turn out for the better, for He is Most-Merciful.

      "text": "Commentary\nOn fulfilling the rights of relatives vigilantly\nPrevious verses were devoted to teachings about the rights of parents and how they should be duly respected. In the present verses, the rights of common relatives have been taken up with the guideline that a relative should be given his or her right. The least degree in which this could be done is to share with them the graces of good social living and treat them well. And if they are needy, helping them financially - in accordance with one's personal capacity - is also included therein. From this verse, at least this much stands proved that everyone has also been obligated with the fulfillment of the right of one's common relatives. at is it? How much is it? Those details have not been mentioned here. But, a broad based mercy and generosity for relatives and a good social interaction with them are certainly included there. According to Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) ، financial help can be extended to two kinds of relatives under this very injunction: (1) A relative, in the category of near blood kinship (Dhu rahim), and in the degree of sanguinity precluding marriage (mahram). A woman or child who neither has the wherewithal to eke out an existence nor has the ability to earn for it. (2) Similar is the case of a relative, in the category of near blood kinship, and in the degree of sanguinity precluding marriage. If handicapped or blind, not having enough money and property in his or her possession to eke out an existence, their relatives who have the necessary means should help them both. Taking care of the essential expenses is a duty enjoined on all of them. If there are several relatives in the same degree of extended means, the expenses will be divided over all of them and the subsistence allowance of the needy will be given in this manner. This rule also has its sanction from the verse of Surah al-Baqarah which says: وَعَلَى الْوَارِ‌ثِ مِثْلُ ذَٰلِكَ (and on the heir it falls likewise - 2:233) (Tafsir Mazhari)\nIn this verse, it has been said that the necessary financial assistance provided to the needy and the wayfarer, and the mercy and generosity practiced in the case of kinsfolk, was their right. The purpose is to point out that the giver has no reason or occasion to harp on the favor done before or behind them because their right is his duty. The giver is simply doing his duty and not showering favours on anyone."

      "text": "The prohibition of spending wastefully (tabdhir)\nThe Qur'an expresses the sense of spending wastefully through two words: (1) Tabdhir (تَبذیر), translated as 'squandering recklessly.' (2) Israf (اِسرِاف): extravagance. The prohibition of tabdhir is already clear in verse 26 here. The prohibition of israf has its proof in the verse of Surah al-A` raf: وَلَا تُسْرِ‌فُوا (and do not be extravagant - 7:31). Some commentators say that both words are synonymous. Any spending in sin or disobedience or a wrong occasion or place is called tabdhir and israf. There are others who refine it by saying that tabdhir is spending in sin or on some totally unsuitable occasion or place, while israf is spending beyond the level of need on an occasion where it is permissible to spend. Therefore, tabdhir is emphatically worse than israf. Al-Mubadhdhirin (the squanderers) were called brothers to Shaitan and his cohorts.\nOf the early Tafsir authorities, Mujahid has said: If someone spends everything he has for the sake of what is haqq, (incumbent), it is no tabdhir (squandering recklessly) - and should he spend even one mudd (1/2 kilo) for what is false (non-incumbent), then it is tabdhir. Sayyidna ` Abdullh ibn Masud ؓ said: Spending out of place in what one has not been obligated with is tabdhir. (Mazhari) Imam Malik said: Tabdhir is that one acquires wealth and property, lawfully and cleanly, as he has been obligated to do, but spends it off in ways counter to it - and this is also given the name of israf (extravagance), which is Haram (unlawful).\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) said: As for things unlawful and impermissible, spending even one dirham for these is tabdhir. And spending limitlessly to fulfill permissible and allowed desires - which exposes one to the danger of becoming a needy beggar in the future - is also included under tabdhir. Yes, if someone keeps his real capital holdings in tact and goes on to spend its profit liberally to fulfill his permissible desires, then, that is not included under tabdhir.

      "text": "Commentary\nWhat an unusual moral training is being given here in this verse through the Holy Prophet ﷺ to the entire Muslim community! It is being said to them: If people needing help come to you and you have nothing to give to them, and for that reason you are compelled to turn away from them, even then, this act of turning away or excusing yourself should not be with an air of indifference, or with an attitude that could be insulting for the addressee. In fact, this turning away or seeking of excuse should be coupled with an expression of your inability or constraint.\nRegarding the background of the revelation of this verse, a report from Sayyidna Ibn Zaid ؓ says that some people used to ask for financial help from the Holy Prophet ﷺ and he knew what would be given to them would be spent in the spreading of disorder. Therefore, he refused to give it to them, for this refusal was a device to stop them from indulging in disorder. Thereupon, this verse was revealed. (Qurtubi)\nIn the Musnad of Said ibn Mansur, it has been mentioned on the authority of Sayyidna Saba' ibn Hakam ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ had received some supply of cloth. He distributed it over those deserving. After that came some others when the supply was finished and he had nothing to give. It was about the later that this verse was revealed."

The purpose is to teach a just and moderate course in spending which does not prevent one from helping others nor does it end up in a lot of trouble for him. There is an event in the background of the revelation of this verse. Ibn Marduwayh has reported it on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ and al-Baghawi, on the authority of Sayyidna Jabir. According to this report, a boy came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and said, \"My mother asks of you a shirt.\" At that time, the Holy Prophet ﷺ had no shirt except the one that was on his blessed body. He told the boy, \"Come some other time when we have enough means to respond to what your mother is asking for.\" The boy went back home, and returned and said, \"My mother says that you kindly give her the very shirt you have on your blessed body.\" Hearing this, the Holy Prophet ﷺ \ttook the shirt off and let him have it. His body was left bare. Came the time for Salah. Sayyidna Bilal ؓ called the Adhan. But, when he did not come out as usual, people were worried. When some of them went in, they saw that he was sitting bare-bodied without the shirt. Thereupon, this verse was revealed."

      "text": "Commentary\nDescribed in this verse is the event of Mi` raj (the Ascent to the heavens, or al-'Isra', the midnight journey of the Holy Prophet ﷺ which is a signal honor and distinctive miracle of our Messenger of Allah ﷺ). The word: أَسْرَ‌ىٰ (asra) is a derivation from: اِسْرَ‌ىٰ (isra' ) which literally means to make someone travel at night. After that, the introduction of the word: لَيْلًا (lailan) also makes this sense very clear. Then, by placing this word as a common noun, the indication released was that during this event the time spent was that of a part of the night - not even that of the whole night. The journey from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa mentioned in this verse is called al-'Isra' and the name of the journey from here to the seven heavens is al-Mi` raj. Isra' stands proved under the definitive textual authority of this verse and the Mi` raj finds mention in the verses of Surah an-Najm and is proved by Ahadith appearing in an uninterrupted succession. The word: بِعَبْدِهِ (bi'abdihi: His servant) used here for the Holy Prophet ﷺ is special. It shows that, in this magnificent setting of honor and welcome, when Allah Ta’ ala, on His own, elects to call someone His servant', a unique bond of love lies embedded therein and that this is the highest honor any man could ever have.\nThis is similar to what has been said in another verse: عِبَادُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ الَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ هَوْنًا (and the servants of Ar-Rahman [ the Most Merciful ] are those who walk on the Earth gently - al-Furqan, 25:63) where the objective is to increase the prestige of those who are acceptable with Him. From here, we also learn that the highest achievement man is capable of is to become a perfect servant of Allah - for, on this eve of special honour, the quality of ideal servitude, out of his many attributes of perfection, was chosen. Then, the presence of this expression yields yet another beneficial outcome in that no one gets the wrong impression of divinity from this wonderful journey by night which, from its beginning to the end, is full of extra-habitual miracles. This is something like what happened with the Christians who fell into deception over the event of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) being raised unto the heavens. For this reason, by saying - ('abd: servant), it was declared that, despite all those attributes, achievements and miracles, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was still a servant of Allah, not god.\nThe Qur'an, Sunnah and 'Ijma' prove that the Mi` raj was physical.\nIt is proved from the text of the Holy Qur'an, and from Ahadith coming in uninterrupted succession mentioned later that the entire journey of the Isra' and Mi` raj was not simply spiritual, instead, it was physical - like the journey of anyone else. The very first word of the Holy Qur'an in this Surah: سُبحَانَ (Subhan: Pure is He! ) carries a hint in this direction because this word is used to register wonder or introduce a great marvel. Had the Mi` raj been merely spiritual, just a matter of dream, what was there so unusual about it? As for a dream, every Muslim, even every human being, can see it and report that he or she went to the heavens, did this and did that.\nThe second indication embedded in the word: عَبد ('abd: servant) also points out in the same direction because ` abd is no spirit all by itself, instead, it is the name of the combination of body and spirit.\nIn addition to that, when the Holy Prophet \tﷺ related the event of Mi` raj to Sayyidah Umm Hani ؓ ، she advised him not to mention it before anyone otherwise people would falsify it even more. Had this been the matter of a dream, what was there in it that needed to be falsified?\nAfter that, when he did tell people about it, the disbelievers of Makkah called it a lie and made fun of him, so much so that some neo-Muslims became apostates (murtadd) after hearing the news. If this would have been the matter of a dream, the likelihood of such reactions was least warranted. And that he had experienced some spiritual Mi` raj in the form of a dream, before this or after that, does not become contrary to it. According to the majority of Muslim scholars, the word: الرُّ‌ؤْيَا (ar-ru'ya) in the verse of the Qur'an: وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّ‌ؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَ‌يْنَاكَ (And We showed you the scene - 17:60) means: رُؤیۃ (ruyah: seeing). But, it has been expressed through the word: رؤیا (ru۔ ya, which is frequently used in the sense of seeing a dream). The reason for this expression could be that this thing has been called ru'ya in the sense of a simile. This is like someone seeing a dream. And if, ru’ ya is taken to mean dream itself, then, it is also not too far out to say that the event of Mi` raj, in addition to its being physical, also transpired, before or after it, in the form of a spiritual Mi` raj as a dream as well. Therefore, the saying, that it was a dream, reported from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ is also correct in its place - but, it does not necessarily imply that physical Mi` raj did not take place.\nIt appears in Tafsir al-Qurtubi that the Ahadith relating to the event of al-Isra' are recurrent and uninterrupted. Naqqash has reported related narratives from twenty Sahabah of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then, Qadi 'Iyad has given additional details in Al-Shifa' (Qurtubi).\nIrnam Ibn Kathir (رح) has, in his Tafsir, reported all these narratives and after applying the standard rules of scrutiny has mentioned the names of twentyfive Sahabah from whom these reports come. Their names are:\n1.\tSayyidna ` Umar ibn al-Khattab,\n2.\tSayyidna 'Ali al-Murtada,\n3.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud,\n4.\tSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari,\n5.\tSayyidna Malik ibn Sa` sa` ah,\n6.\tSayyidna Abu Hurairah,\n7.\tSayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri,\n8.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas,\n9.\tSayyidna Shaddad ibn Aws,\n10.\tSayyidna Ubaiyy ibn Ka'b,\n11.\tSayyidna ` Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Quraz,\n12.\tSayyidna Abu Hayyah (اَبُو حیہ),\n13.\tSayyidna Abu Laila,\n14.\tSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar,\n15.\tSayyidna Jabir ibn ` Abdullah,\n16.\tSayyidna Hudhayfah ibn Yaman,\n17.\tSayyidna Buraidah,\n18.\tSayyidna Abu Ayyut al-Ansari,\n19.\tSayyidna Abu 'Umamah,\n20.\tSayyidna Samurah ibn Jundub,\n21.\tSayyidna Abu al-Hamra',\n22.\tSayyidna Suhayb al-Rumi,\n23.\tSayyidah Umm Hani',\n24.\tUmm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah ` A'ishah,\n25.\tSayyidah Asma' bint Abi Bakr, After that, Ibn Kathir said:\nفَحدِیث الاسراِء اجمع علیہ المسلمون و اعرض عنہ الزنادقۃ و الملحدون (ابن کثیر)\nAs for the Hadith of al-Isra', there is a consensus of all Muslim on it. Only heretics and atheists have denied it. (Ibn Kathir)\nA brief account of Mi` raj - as reported by Ibn Kathir\nAfter having explained the present verse in his Tafsir along with a detailed background of relevant Ahadith, Imam Ibn Kathir (رح) has said: The truth of the matter is that the journey of Isra' came to pass when the Holy Prophet ﷺ was awake, not dreaming. From Makkah al-Mukarramah to Baitulmaqdis, the journey was covered on buraq (a special heavenly horse to ride). When he reached the gate of Baitulmaqdis, he tied the buraq close to the gate, entered the Masjid of Baitulmaqdis and offered two rak’ at of Tahiyyatul-masjid (prayer in honor of the Mosque) facing its orientation. After that, a staircase was brought which had steps to go up from below. Through this staircase, he went to the first heaven. After that, he went to the rest of the heavens. [ Only Allah knows the reality of this staircase - what it was and how did it work and things like that. In our day too, many kinds of stairs are in use. There are stairs that escalate automatically and there are elevators that take one up. Therefore, falling into any doubt or suspicion about this miraculous staircase is not right.] On every heaven, the resident angels greeted him and on every heaven, he met blessed prophets who were stationed on a particular heaven, such as, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) on the sixth heaven, and Sayyidna Ibrahim Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) on the seventh heaven. After that, he went beyond the stations of all these blessed prophets and reached a plain where he could hear the sound of the pen writing destinies. And he saw the Sidratul-muntaha, the Far Tree in Jannah, on which moths in gold and variegated colors were falling from above by the command of Allah and which was surrounded by angels of Allah. And it was at this place that the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw Sayyidna Jibra` il al-Amin in his real form with six hundred wings. And right there, he saw a flag in green that had the horizon all covered up. And he also saw al-Bayt al-Ma` mur (the well-attended House believed to be located in Jannah exactly above the Baytullah in Makkah) sitting by which was the founder of the Ka'bah, Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) with his back reclining against its wall. Seventy thousand angels enter this Bayt al-Ma` mur every day who shall be waiting for their turn to re-enter there right through the day of Qiyamah. And the Holy Prophet ﷺ saw the Jannah and the Jahannam with his own blessed eyes. At that time, first came the command that his people were being obligated with fifty prayers, then, these were reduced to five. This shows the importance and merit of Salah as being the foremost out of all acts of ` Ibadah.\nAfter that, he alighted back into Baytul-maqdis and, with him, so did the blessed prophets he had met on different heavens (as if) they had come to see him off as far as Baytul-maqdis. At that time, as it was time for Salah, he offered the prayer with all prophets. It is also probable that this Salah was the Salah of Fajr the same day. Ibn Kathir says that this event concerning the prayer with prophets led by the Holy Prophet ﷺ has come to pass, as held by some, before he went to the heavens. But, as obvious, this event took place after the return because it has been reported in the incident relating to his meeting with blessed prophets at different heavens that it was Sayyidna Jibra'il who introduced him to all prophets. Had this event relating to his leading the prayer passed earlier, no introduction was needed there - and, for that matter, it is obvious enough that the real purpose of this journey was to visit with the heavenly hosts. Doing that first appears to be more likely. Once he was done with the real mission, all prophets came to say good bye to him up to Baytul-maqdis and by making him the Imam of the prayer through a signal from Sayyidna Jibra'il, his precedence over others was demonstrated practically.\nAfter that, he departed from Baytul-maqdis riding buraq and reached Makkah al-Mu` azzamah while it was still dark. وَاللہ سبحانہ تعالیٰ اَعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nThe testimony of a non-Muslim about the event of Mi` raj\nIt appears in Tafsir ibn Kathir that Hafiz Abu Nu'aym al-Isbahani, in his book, Dala'il al-Nubuwwah, has reported a narrative from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi on the authority of Muhammad ibn ` Amr al-Waqidi giving details of the event as follows:\n. The Scholars of Hadith say that Al-Waqidi is weak in Hadith narrations but a cautious Muhaddith like Imam Ibn Kathir has reported his narration for the reason that this matter is not connected with ` Aqa'id or Halal and Haram and in such historical matters his narration is trustworthy - Muhammad Shafi' eager to use this occasion to say things about the Holy Prophet ﷺ which show his insignificance. But, says Abu Sufyan: Nothing stopped me from doing that except that I may slip and say something which turns out to be a lie and I stand disgraced in the eyes of the Emperor and my own comrades keep taunting me for being a liar. Certainly, then it occurred to me that I should relate the event of Mi` raj before him. The Emperor would himself conclude from it that it was a lie. So, I said: I shall describe before you what he claims to have happened to him regarding which you will yourself realize that it was a lie. Hiraql asked: What event is that? Abu Sufyan said: This claimant of prophet-hood says that, one night, he left Makkah al-Mukarramah, reached this Masjid Baytul-maqdis of yours and, then, within that night, before dawn, he returned to us in Makkah al-Mukarramah!\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ sent Sayyidna Dihyah ibn Khalifah with a blessed letter from him to the Roman Emperor, Caesar. After that, he has given a detailed account of how Sayyidna Dihyah reached the Emperor, delivered the letter, and how intelligent he was in his mission (an event present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari as well as in all trustworthy books of Hadith). Towards the end of it, it has been reported that Hiraql, the Roman Emperor, once he had read the blessed letter, ordered that all Arab traders who were visiting the country at that time should be assembled together. He wanted to investigate into the background of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . The royal order was carried out. Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and those with him visiting Syria at that time with their famous trade caravan were presented before the Emperor. Details of the questions asked by the Emperor are present in the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as elsewhere. Abu Sufyan was really\nAt that time, the leading scholar of Elia' (Baytul-maqdis) was standing close to Hiraql, the Roman Emperor. He disclosed that he knew that night. The Emperor turned to him and inquired as to how did he come to know about it. He submitted that, as a matter of habit, he would not sleep at night until he had closed all gates of Baytul-maqdis. That night he habitually closed all gates but one which would not close despite his effort. He summoned his staff. They all tried but they too failed to close it. The panels of the gate remained simply unmoved from their place. It seemed as if they were trying to move some mountain. Rendered helpless, he called technicians and carpenters. They looked at the gate and decided that the weight of the building has come to rest on the panels of the gate. There was no way it could be closed before morning. When morning comes, they said, they will see how this could be fixed. Nonplussed, he returned leaving both panels of the gate ajar. As soon as it was morning, he came back to the gate where he noticed that someone had made a hole in the rock close to the gate of the Masjid which gave the impression that some animal was tied down there. At that time he had told his colleagues: Perhaps, Allah Ta` ala has caused this gate not to close today because some prophet was to come here. And then, he also stated that this blessed prophet has also offered his prayer in this Masjid of ours. Thereafter, he has described further details. (Ibn Kathir, p. 24, v. 3)\nThe date of the event of a1-'Isra' and Mi` raj\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) has said in his Tafsir that the narratives of Hadith regarding the date of Mi` raj are quite different. According to Musa ibn 'Uqbah, this event came to pass six month before the Hijrah to Madinah. Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ says that Umm al-Mu'minin Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ had passed away before the injunction making Salah a Fard (obligation) was revealed. Imam Zuhri says that the event of the sad demise of Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ took place seven years after the call to the mission of prophet-hood.\nAccording to some Hadith narratives, the event of Mi` raj happened five years after the call to prophet-hood. Ibn Ishaq says that the event of Mi` raj took place at a time when Islam had spread throughout the tribes of Arabia generally. The outcome of all these narratives is that the event of Mi` raj dates back to several years before the Hijrah to Madinah.\nAl-Harbi says that the event of al-'Isra' and Mi` raj has happened during the night of the 27th of Rabi' ath-Thani, one year before Hijrah and Ibn al-Qasim adh-Dhahabi says that it took place eighteen months after the call to prophethood. Esteemed Muhaddithin (Hadith scholars) who have mentioned these different narratives have not followed it up with any decisive statement. And as commonly known, the 27th night of the month of Rajab is the Night of Mi` raj. وَاللہ سُبحَانہ تعالیٰ اعلَم (And Allah, the Pure and the High, knows best).\nAl-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Aqsa\nSayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : 'Which Masjid of this world comes first?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Haram.' Then he inquired, 'Which one after that?' He said, 'Al-Masjid al-Aqsa.' Then he tried to find out the intervening time difference between the two whereupon he said, 'Forty years.' After that, he added, ' (as for the order of these masajid, this is it) but, Allah Ta’ ala has made the entire Earth a masjid for us. Wherever comes the time of Salah, offer it right there.' (Reported by Muslim)\nEarly Tafsir authority, Mujahid says that Allah Ta` ala has made the site of Baytullah two thousand years before He made the entire Earth and that its foundations reach as far down as the seventh (strata of) Earth and that al-Masjid al-Aqsa was made by Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) . (Reported by an-Nasa'i with sound chains of authority from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Umar) (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, p. 137, v. 4)\nAnd al-Masjid al-Haram is the name of the Mosque that stands around the Baytullah ash-Sharif while, on occasions, the entire Haram is also identified as al-Masjid al-Haram. In terms of this second sense, the dichotomy of those two reports - some hold that the Holy Prophet ﷺ left for the nocturnal journey, al-'Isra', from the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ while others say that he departed from the section of Baytullah known as Hatim - stands removed. If we were to take al-Masjid al-Haram in its general sense, it is not far out to believe that he may have been there in the home of Sayyidah Umm Hani' ؓ first, then he walked over to the Hatim of Ka'bah and then began the journey of al-'Isra' from there. Allah knows best.\nAI-Masjid al-Aqsa and blessings of the Syrian environs\nThe word: حَول - (hawl: environs) in the verse: بارکنا حولہ (the environs of which We have blessed) means the entire land of Syria. It appears in a Hadith that Allah Ta` ala has made the land from the ` Arsh (Divine Throne) to the river, Euphrates and, out of this, He has bestowed particular holiness on the land of Palestine. (Ruh al-Maani)\nThe blessings it has are both religious and worldly. As for religious blessings, it has been the Qiblah of all past prophets, and their home, and the last resting place. And that its land is green, lush and verdant with streams, rivers and fruit farms etc. shows its worldly blessings.\nSayyidna Mu` adh ibn Jabal reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Allah Ta’ ala says: 0 land of Syria, thou art My region chosen from many and I shall make My chosen servants reach thee. (Qurtubi) And it appears in a Hadith of the Musnad of Ahmad that the Imposter will traverse the whole Earth but he will not be granted access to four Mosques: (1) Masjid of Madinah, (2) Masjid of Makkah al-Mukarramah, (3) Al-Masjid al-Aqsa and (4) Masjid Tur."

      "text": "Spending in the way of Allah so liberally as would throw one in trouble: The pros and cons of it\nThe verse, given the outer view, seems to prohibit the kind of spending following which the spender himself ends up becoming poor and needy, a prey of all sorts of hardships and anxieties. Tafsir authority, al-Qurtubi has said that this injunction covers the general condition of Muslims who would, after such spending, find the resulting hardships distressing and the whole thing would make them contrite over past give-outs and grieve about it. The word: مَّحْسُورً‌ا (mahsura: empty-handed - 29) of the Holy Qur'an provides a hint in this direction. (As in Tafsir Mazhari) As for the people of high determination, who would not be emotionally disturbed by hardships that may come later and would still go on fulfilling rights of those who hold such rights, this restriction does not apply to them. This is the reason that it was the customary practice of the Holy Prophet ﷺ that he would not store anything for tomorrow.\nWhat came today was spent out today. And there were occasions when he would remain hungry reaching the outer limits of having to tie a piece of rock against his stomach (to simulate the weight of food). Then there were many among the noble Sahabah who had spent their entire wealth and property in the way of Allah during the blessed period of the Holy Prophet ﷺ who did not categorically prohibit it nor did he blame them for it. This tells us that the prohibition contained in this verse is for those who cannot brave the hardships of poverty and hunger and they would start to rue after spending that they would have been better off if they had not spent in the way of Allah. If so, this attitude would nullify the good they had done in the past. Hence, the prohibition.\nPoorly managed spending is prohibited\nAnd the main thing in the verse is that it prohibits spending haphazardly in the sense that one would ignore what may happen in the near future and spend on the spot. The result is that comes tomorrow, other needy people show up or one is required to take care of a major religious exigency and he would, then, be in no position to help out. (Qurtubi) Or, he may be rendered equally incapable of fulfilling the rights of his family, something he is duty-bound to fulfill. (Mazhari) Explaining the words: مَلُومًا مَّحْسُورً‌ا (reproached, empty-handed - 29), Tafsir Mazhari says that the first word: مَلُوم (malum) relates to the first condition, that is, miserliness - meaning if he were to hold back on giving out of miserliness, people would reproach him.' And the word: مَّحْسُورً‌ا (mahsura) relates to some condition other than this - meaning that one should not exaggerate in spending to the extent that he himself becomes a pauper. If so, he will turn empty-handed, defeated and rueful."

      "text": "Commentary\nPrevious verses carried a series of instructions regarding human rights. The sixth injunction appearing here is to correct a cruel custom prevailing among the people of Arabs of Jahiliyyah. During that period of time, some people used to kill their children, particularly daughters, at birth in fear of having to face the expenses on their maintenance. In the verse cited above, Allah Ta` ala has admonished them for their ignorance in assuming the responsibility of providing sustenance - who are you to do that?' This is the exclusive domain of Allah Ta’ ala. He is the One who gives you your sustenance. Now, He who gives it to you shall be the One who would give it to them as well. Why then, do you have to take the onus of killing children on yourselves because of this concern? In fact, by making the children precede as recipients of sustenance at this place, Allah Ta` ala has subtly indicated that He shall give to the children first, then give it to the parents. It really means that Allah Ta’ ala, when He sees His servant supporting his family or helping others poor and weak, He gives him liberally in proportion to enable him to meet his needs as well as help others. In a Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported to have said, اِنَّمَا تُنصِرُونَ وَ تُرزَقُونَ بضُعفَایٔکُم which means: 'It is because of the poor and weak among you that you are provided by Allah with your sustenance.' This tells us that parents who support their family get, whatever they do, for the sake of weak women and children alone.\nRuling\nThis statement of the Qur'an also sheds light on an issue which holds the modern world in its grip. Its movers and shakers are so scared of what they call 'population explosion' that they are frantically promoting birth control and planned parent-hood. This is also based on the same false assumption that they are the ones responsible for sustenance. May be, this approach is not a sin equal in gravity to that of the killing of children, but there is no doubt about its being blameworthy."

Though, this crime is not directly related to the rights of the servants of Allah but it may have been mentioned here as part of other rights taken up at this place for the reason that this crime is contagious. It brings other crimes along which disturb the rights of the servants of Allah through loss of lives and properties. Therefore, Islam has declared this crime to be more serious than any other crime. Then, it has also fixed its punishment as the harshest of all crimes because this one is a carrier of hundreds of these.\nIt appears in Hadith that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"The heavens and the earth, the seven of them each, curse the married person who commits adultery. And the strong stench which spreads out from the private parts of such people will embarrass even the people condemned to Hell and thus there in Hell they will be suffering from the punishment of fire and disgrace both.\" (Reported by al-Bazzar on the authority of Sayyidna Buraidah - Mazhari) In another Hadith from Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ it has been reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"A fornicator when fornicating is not a believer. A thief when stealing is not a believer. And a drunkard while drinking is not a believer.\" This Hadith is there in al-Bukhari and Muslim. Its explanation, as it appears in the report of Abu Dawud, says: At the time those committing such crimes are practically involved in it, 'Iman (faith) leaves their heart and comes out, and when they turn away from it, 'Iman returns back in.

      "text": "Commentary\nThis eighth injunction is about the prohibition of killing unjustly. Virtually all groups, religions and sects of the world take it to be a grave crime. In Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"The destruction of the en-tire world is lighter in the sight of Allah than the unjust killing of a believer.\" In addition to this, some reports also carry the words: \"Even if the inhabitants of Allah's seven heavens and seven earths were to join in the killing of a believer unjustly, He will put all of them into the Hell.\" (Ibn Majah with a chain classified as Hasan and al-Baihaqi - from Mazhari)\nAnd in another Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported to have said, \"Whoever abets in the killing of a believer by assisting the killer even with one word will be brought before Allah Ta’ ala on the day of Resurrection. And written on his forehead shall be:\tآیس من رحمۃ اللہ (Deprived of the mercy of Allah). (Mazhari from Ibn Majah and Isbahani)\nAnd al-Baihaqi reports on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas and Sayyidna Mu'wiyah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Hopefully, Allah Ta` ala may forgive every sin except that of the person who died in the state of disbelief (kufr) or who killed a believer intentionally and unjustly.\"\nThe meaning of Unjust Killing\nImam al-Bukhari and Muslim have reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud\tرضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"The blood of any Muslim who bears testimony that Allah is one and I am His Messenger is not halal (lawful) except under three situations. (1) He has, despite being married, committed adultery (for his legal punishment is that he should be stoned to death). (2) He who has killed a person unjustly [ for his punishment is that the waliyy (legal heir) of the person killed can get him killed under the law of qisas (even retaliation)]. (3) A person who has reneged [ as an apostate: murtadd ] from the religion of Islam (for he too is killed in punishment).\nWho has the right to take Qisas?\nIt has been said in this verse that this is the right of the waliyy (legal heir) of the person killed. In the absence of a lineal waliyy, the head of the Islamic government will have this right - for, he too, in a way, is the waliyy of all Muslims. Therefore, in Islamic juristic terminology, the former is called real and the later, legal.\nInjustice is not answered by injustice, but by justice: So, be just even when punishing criminals\nThe statement: فَلَا يُسْرِ‌ف فِّي الْقَتْلِ ('fala yusriffi al-qatl': but he shall not cross the limit in the matter of taking life) is a special provision of Islamic law the outcome of which is that it is not permissible to avenge injustice by counter injustice. Even when retaliating, it is necessary to uphold the demand of justice. Until such time that the legal heir (waliyy) of the person killed upholds justice and seeks an even retaliation in favor of the person killed represented by him, through the legal provisions of Qisas, then, the law of the Shari` ah stands in his favor. The reason is that he is surely supported, and Allah Ta` a1 is the supporter. And in case, he is all blinded by the desire of revenge and exceeds the limits of Islamic legal retaliation, then he, instead of being the one oppressed (mazlum), became the oppressor (Zalim) while the oppressor (zalim) be-came the one oppressed by him (mazlum). Now things will stand reversed. Allah Ta` ala and His Law will not support him. Instead, it will support the other party and shield him from injustice.\nDuring the days of the Jahiliyyah, it was common practice of the Arabs that, in retaliation of a person killed, they would avenge him by killing anyone they could lay their hands on from among the family or friends of the killer. There were occasions when it would turn out that the person killed was someone notable among them. In that case, they would not take it as sufficient to kill only the killer in even retaliation for their man. In fact, to avenge one life, they would take the lives of two, three or many more men. Some of them would become so crazy in the heat of their passion for revenge that they would not be simply satisfied after having killed the killer. They went on to commit the horror of cutting off body parts such as the nose, ears etc. to serve as deterrents. All such actions are extra to the limits set by the Islamic Law of Even Retaliation (al-qisas), and are patently haram (unlawful). Therefore, such activities have been stopped by the proviso: I ) (but he shall not cross the limit in the matter of taking life).\nAn anecdote worth remembering\nSomeone accused Hajjaj ibn Yusuf before certain Mujtahid Imams. Hajjaj ibn Yusuf is the most notorious tyrant of Islamic history. Since, he has killed thousands of Sahabah and Tabi` in unjustly, therefore, it generally happens that people tend to overlook the evil lurking behind calling him evil. The pious elder before whom this accusation was leveled against Hajjaj ibn Yusuf asked the accusers, \"Do you have any authority or evidence to support your accusation?\" They said, \"No.\" Then he said, \"If Allah Ta’ ala will avenge the unjust killing of thousands of in-nocent people by Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, remember that anyone who is unjust to Hajjaj will also not be allowed to escape from that revenge. Allah Ta` la will wreak vengeance of Hajjaj from him too. There is no partisanship in the justice of Allah Ta` ala, therefore, it is not possible that He would release others to go about maligning His sinning servants by giving them a free hand to accuse and blame them at will."

      "text": "Commentary\nMentioned in the two verses cited above, there are three injunctions: the ninth, the tenth and the eleventh. They relate to financial rights. It will be recalled that previous verses dealt with physical rights while the financial ones appear here.\nCaution in handling the property of orphans\nThe ninth injunction given in the first verse (34) concerns the protection of properties owned by orphans and the observation of caution in their handling. Laying emphasis on it, it was said: 'And do not go (even) near the property of orphans.' It means that there should be no free use of their property counter to the provisions of the Shari` ah or the interest and advantage of the children. Those who are charged with the protection and management of the properties of orphans are duty-bound to observe utmost caution therein. When spending, they must spend only in the interest and to the advantage of orphans - and definitely not as based on their whim or lack of concern. And this pattern of management is to continue until such time when the orphaned children grow up and become capable of protecting their property themselves - the lower limit is when they attain to the age of fifteen years while the higher is eighteen years.\nThe fact is that it is just not permissible to spend from anyone's property through false means. But, it has been mentioned here in the case of orphans particularly because they themselves are incapable of keeping or taking account and no one is expected to know about it. So, a place where no one is present to demand one's right is exactly the place where the demand of Allah Ta’ ala becomes stronger and harder. Any shortfall in disbursing such rights becomes more sinful as compared to the rights of common people.\nFulfillment of Covenants and Implementation of Contracts\nThe tenth injunction enjoins the fulfillment of the covenant. There are two forms of the covenant. The first form has two aspects to it: (1) Between Allah and His servant, like the covenant of the servant in eternity that Allah is their Lord. This covenant necessarily results in obedience to His injunctions and the seeking of His pleasure. This is a covenant every human being has made in eternity irrespective of whether he or she is a believer or a disbeliever. (2) The second covenant is the covenant of a believer made through shahadah or professing of the kalimah: لا إله إلا اللہ (la ilaha illallah: there is no god but Allah) the outcome of which is a perfect following of Divine injunctions and the seeking of His pleasure.\nThe second form of the covenant takes effect between human beings themselves. This includes all treaties, pacts, agreements, pledges and contracts - political, commercial, or transactional - that are made between individuals or groups or institutions all over the world.\nThe fulfillment of all covenants identified in the first form is obligatory on human beings. As for the other kind of covenants or contracts, it is also obligatory to fulfill them subject to the condition that they should not be against the Islamic Law. As for those that are against the Islamic Law, it is obligatory to terminate them - after having first served a notice on the other party. If one of the parties does not fulfill, the other party has the right to go to the court and make them fulfill it. Essentially, a contract is an agreement between two parties that they would do or not do something. And in case, someone unilaterally promises to some-one else that he would give him a certain thing or meet him at a certain time or take care of a certain task for him, then, it is also obligatory to fulfill this promise. There are commentators who include this too under the sense of covenant, but they do so with a slight difference. We know when two parties are bound by a contract, any contravention by one of them can be challenged in the court and the other party can force its completion. But, the fulfillment of a unilateral promise cannot be enforced through the court. Of course, if someone were to go back on the promise made to someone else - without any valid legal excuse permitted by the Shari` ah - he will be committing a sin. In Hadith, this has been called hypocrisy in acts.\nAt the end of this verse, it was said: إِنَّ الْعَهْدَ كَانَ مَسْئُولًا (Surely, the covenant shall be asked about). It means: 'On the day of Qiyamah, the way questions shall be asked about the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of obligatory divine injunctions, so it will be with mutual contracts - these too will be asked about.' Here, it has been left at that only: 'it will be asked about.' at is going to happen next after the questioning? This has been left untold. Perhaps, intended as such, it may be signaling towards the danger being great!\nThe eleventh injunction enjoins fulfillment of weights and measures in transactions of buying and selling and forbids any short measuring. Full details appear in Surah al-Mutaffifin (83).\nRuling\nRespected jurists of Islam say that the outcome of the injunction against shortening weights and measures is that it is Haram (unlawful) to give less than whatever is the due of whoever it may be. Therefore, it is also included therein that an employee curtails the assigned duty entrusted with him or gives a time that is less than what should actually be given to it, or that a worker shirks work and fails to deliver what is due out of it."

      "text": "The prohibition of giving weights and measures short: Ruling\nRegarding the verse: أَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ إِذَا كِلْتُمْ (And give full measure when you measure - 35), Abu Hayyan says in Tafsir al-Bahr al-Muhit that the responsibility of giving full weight and measure in this verse has been placed on the seller (بَأِع : ba'i`) which tells us that it is the seller who is responsible for weighing, measuring and seeing that it is full as due.\nAt the end of verse 35, it was said about the fulfillment of weight and measure: ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ‌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا (That is good, and better in the end). As for making the weight and measure correct and even, two things have been said here: (1) Firstly, the rule is good. It means that it is intrinsically good. No normal and decent person is going to take weighing less and measuring short as something nice, neither religiously, nor rationally, nor naturally. (2) Secondly, it is better in the end. The end includes the consequent success of the Hereafter, reward of deeds and the blessing of Paradise as well as the happy outcome of the very life in this world. This is suggestive of the fact that no business can prosper until its goodwill stands recognized in the market - and that cannot happen without this commercial honesty."

      "text": "Commentary\nTwo injunctions in these verses, the twelfth and the thirteenth, relate to mores of common social living. The twelfth injunction forbids doing something without having become certain about it.\nAt this stage, we should not lose sight of the fact that certainty has different degrees. There is a degree of certainty that reaches the level of perfect certitude, a state that leaves no room of even the slightest doubt contrary to it. Then, it could descend to the degree of strong likelihood - even though, there does exist the probability of a contrary aspect. Simi-larly, divine injunctions are also of two kinds: (1) Absolutes and Certain-ties, such as, Articles and Principles of Religion. These require certainty of the first degree. Acting without it is not permissible. (2) Strong Likelihood or Overwhelming Probability, the example of which are injunctions relating to subsidiary deeds. After having given these details, we can state the objective of the cited verse by saying that the element of certainty in injunctions that are Certain and Absolute should also be of the first degree. In other words, it should have attained the degree of perfect certitude and absolute category. And until this happens, this pseudo certainty is not trustworthy in the matter of the basic Articles and Principles of Islam. Acting on its dictates is not permissible. As for the subsidiary injunctions, a certainty of the second degree, that is, of Overwhelming Probability is sufficient. (Bayan al-Qur'an)\nQuestions will be asked on the day of Qiyamah about the ear, the eye and the heart\nThis is what we have been told in verse 36: إِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ‌ وَالْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولَـٰئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْئُولًا It means that the ear will be asked as to what did it keep hearing throughout its life. The eye will be asked as to what did it keep seeing throughout its life. The heart will be asked as to what did it keep cooking in its chambers and what was it that it believed in throughout its life. If things were heard through the ears, the hearing of which was not permissible in Shari` ah, such as hearing ill of someone behind his back (ghibah) or hearing unlawful vocal and instrumental music etc., then, punishment will follow the question. If things were seen through the eyes, the seeing of which was not permissible, such as casting an evil eye on a non-Mahram woman or a beardless, handsome youth etc. then, punishment will follow the question. Or, planted a belief in the heart contrary to the Qur'an, and Sunnah, or nursed a baseless blame in the heart regarding someone, then, punishment will follow the question. The fact is that, on that fateful day of Qiyamah, questions will be asked about virtually all blessings given by Allah Ta’ ala. It was said in Surah at-Takathur: لَتُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ النَّعِيمِ : \"And you shall certainly be asked on that day [ of Qiyamah ] about all blessings [ of Allah Ta’ ala ] - 102:8.\" Since, the ear, the eye and the heart are more important and significant out of these blessings, these were mentioned here particularly.\nTafsir al-Qurtubi and Mazhari give yet another sense of the verse in terms of the close proximity of the statement in the first sentence and the next. In the first sentence, it was said: وَلَا تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ (And do not pursue that which you have no knowledge of - 36). Adjacent to it follows the statement that the ear, the eye and the heart - each one of them shall be interrogated about. The sense that emerges from this proximity is that a person who blamed someone without first ascertaining and becoming certain about it, or did something impulsively without doing that first, then, should this thing be related to what is heard through ears, the ears shall be questioned. And if this is 'seen', the eyes shall be questioned. And if comprehended through the heart, the heart shall be questioned to determine whether this person is true or false in his blame or in the belief he has allowed to become rooted in his heart. Thereupon, these very body parts shall speak up as witnesses on the day of Resurrection. It will be a cause of disgrace for those who accuse others without being certain and those who do things the truth of which has not been ascertained first. This is as it appears in Surah Sin: الْيَوْمَ نَخْتِمُ عَلَىٰ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتُكَلِّمُنَا أَيْدِيهِمْ وَتَشْهَدُ أَرْ‌جُلُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ﴿65﴾:\"Today [ on the day of Qiyamah ] We shall set a seal on their mouths and their hands shall speak and their feet shall bear witness as to what they have been earning [ by making these limbs of their body do whatever of good or bad they chose ] - 36:65\".\nPerhaps, the ears, the eyes and the heart have been particularized here on the basis that Allah Ta’ ala has blessed man with sense and consciousness through them. The purpose is to let him first ascertain, examine, and test a thought or belief that crosses his heart. If he finds it true, and sound, let him, then, put it in practice. And should it turn out to be false, let him, then, stay away from it. Anyone who does not use these faculties and goes about following things he has no knowledge of, things the truth of which he has not ascertained first, then, this person is guilty of being ungrateful to these blessings of Allah Ta` ala.\nNow, the senses through which man becomes aware of different things are five: the ears, the eyes, the nose, the faculty of speech and the sensation in the whole body that tells one about something being hot or cold. But, habitually man finds out more through the ears and eyes. Awareness about things acquired through the senses of smell, taste and touch is fairly lower in frequency as compared to things heard or seen. That it has been considered sufficient to mention only two of the five senses at this place may, perhaps, be because of this very reason. Then, even from among these two, it is the ear that has been made to precede the eye - and on other occasions of the Holy Qur'an as well, wherever these two has been mentioned, it is the ear that has been mentioned first. In all likelihood, the reason for it is that the major part of man's in-formation is comprised of things heard through the ears. Things seen through the eyes happen to be comparatively much less."

      "text": "The thirteenth injunction appearing in the second of the two cited verses (37) is: وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ مَرَ‌حًا (And do not walk on the earth haughtily). It means that one should not walk in a way that shows arrogance, pride and exultation, for this is an idiotic act. It is as if one would like to tear the earth apart just by walking on it - something not in his power to accomplish. Or, as if by walking with a challenging gait, he would like to rise much higher - but the mountains of Allah rise far higher than he could ever beat anatomically. In reality, arrogance as such is a major sin that can afflict human heart mortally. Therefore, one must guard against even signs of arrogance exhibited through the way one goes about in life, for they too are impermissible, after all. Walking haughtily, even though one may not be walking by exerting force on the earth, and assuming airs and posing high are impermissible under all conditions. Arrogance is to take yourself superior to others and rate others to be inferior to you. Severe warnings against it appear in Hadith.\nImam Muslim (رح) has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Iyad ibn ` Ammar ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Allah Ta` ala has sent this command to me through revelation: Take to humility. Let no man pride on another man, nor adopt an attitude of self-eminence and let no one be unjust to anyone.\" (Mazhari)\nAnd Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ narrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, Not to enter Paradise is he who has arrogance in his heart even to the measure of a particle\" (Mazhari with reference to the Sahih of Muslim).\nAnd it has been reported in Hadith Qudsi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Allah Ta’ ala says that grandeur is My mantle and greatness is My breech. Whoever tries to snatch these from Me, him I shall put in Jahannam (The words rida' and izar signify dress and Allah Ta` ala has no mass or body that would need a dress. Therefore, at this place, it means the attribute of divine glory. So, whoever betrays the wish to become associated with Allah Ta’ ala in this attribute belongs to Hell).\nAnd in another Hadith the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported to have said, \"On the day of Qiyamah, arrogant people will be raised as humans scaled down to the size of tiny ants under the shadow of disgrace descending from all sides. They will be driven to a prison of Hell called Bulas. It will be surrounded with blazing fire, the highest around, and they will be drinking pus and blood excreted by the inmates of Hell to quench their thirst.\" (Tirmidhi on the authority of ` Amr ibn Shu'aib, he from his father, he from his grandfather - Mazhari)\nAnd speaking from the pulpit, Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ said, \"I have heard from the Holy Prophet ﷺ that a person who takes to humility, Allah Ta’ ala elevates him to higher ranks following which he is, though, insignificant in his own sight, but he is great in the sight of everybody else. And whoever waxes proud, him Allah Ta’ ala puts to disgrace following which he is, though, great in his own sight but he is, in the sight of people, worse than a dog and pig.\" (Mazhari)"

      "text": "Sequence of Verses\nVerses 2 and 3 featuring the statement: (We made it guidance for the children of Bani Isra'il) exhorted the Bani Isra'il to follow and obey the Divine Law. The verses that follow warn and admonish them on their disobedience. These verses mention two events relating to the Bani Isra'il so that they serve as a lesson. Tuned to sin and disobedience, first they increased the tempo of their hostility. Allah Ta` ala set their enemies upon them. They shook them up. The Jews got the message, cut down on their mischief and gave the impression of having been corrected. But, soon after, the same lust for mischief and misdeeds overtook them. So then, Allah Ta’ ala had them punished at the hands of their enemies. The Qur'an mentions two events while history carries six like these:\n1.\tThe first event came to pass some time after the demise of Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the founder of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, when the ruler of Baytul-maqdis became irreligious and corrupt. The ruler of Egypt attacked him and took away the gold and silver of Baytul-maqdis. But, he did not demolish the city and the Masjid.\n2.\tThe second event relates to the period nearly four hundred years after that. Some Jews settled in Baytul-maqdis started idol-worship while the rest began disputing among themselves. This ill omen prompted another ruler of Egypt to attack them which somewhat affected the city and the Masjid both. After that, their condition took a turn for the better.\n3.\tThe third event came to pass after some years when Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon ransacked Baytul-maqdis. He conquered the city, looted property and took back a lot of people as prisoners of war. When he left, he had a member of the family of the former king appointed a ruler of the city as his deputy.\n4.\tWhen this new king, who worshipped idols and was corrupt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, he returned, killed people, destroyed property en masse and burned the city razing it to rubbles. This happened nearly four hundred and fifteen years after the construction of the Masjid. After that, the Jews went out as exiles to Babylon where they lived in disgrace for seventy years. After that, the King of Iran attacked the King of Babylon and conquered it. Then the King of Iran showed mercy to the Jewish expatriates and ordered that they should be sent back to Syria along with things looted from them. Now the Jews had repented having forsaken their habitual sins and misdeeds. When they resettled there, they restored the original structure of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa with the support of the King of Iran.\n5.\tThen came the fifth event. When the Jews had peace and prosperity once again, the first thing they forgot was their past. They returned to the kind of evil deeds they were used to. Then, it so happened that, one hundred and seventy years before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the king who had founded Antakiah (Antioch) attacked, killed forty thousand Jews and took with him another forty thousand as prisoners and slaves, even desecrated the Masjid though its structure remained safe. But, later, the successors of that king rendered the city and the Masjid totally denuded. Soon after this, Baytul-maqdis came under the authority of Roman kings. They put the Masjid back into shape and it was after eight years that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was born.\n6.\tForty years after the physical ascension of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the Jews chose to rebel against their Roman rulers. The Romans destroyed the city and the Masjid once again relegating it to what it was. The king at that time was called Titus who was neither Jewish nor Christian because long after him Constantine I was a Christian. From that time to the time of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، this Masjid lay desolate until he had it reconstructed. These six events have been reported in Tafsir Bayan al-Qur'an with reference to Tafsir Haqqani.\nNow, it is difficult to precisely determine as to which two out of those mentioned above are the two events mentioned by the Holy Qur’ an. But, as obvious, the events that are major and serious among these, in which the Jews were far too wicked and more seriously punished too, should be taken as the likely ones. The fourth and the sixth event seem to be fit for such application. At this point, a lengthy Hadith narrated by Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ، with its chains of authority ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، has been reported in Tafsir al-Qurtubi. It also helps in determining that these two events mean the fourth and the sixth event. The translation of this lengthy Hadith is given below:\nSayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ if Baytul-maqdis was a great Masjid in the sight of Allah. He said that it was the most distinct house of Worship in the world, the greatest of all houses, which Allah Ta’ ala made for Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the son of Dawud, peace be on both, with gold, silver and precious stones like ruby and emerald. The manner in which this happened was, when Sulayman (علیہ السلام) started its construction, Allah Ta` ala made the Jinn subservient to him. The Jinn collected this gold, silver and precious stones and used them in the making of the Masjid. Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ' says that he, then, asked as to where and how did all that gold, silver and precious stones go out of Baytul-Maqdis? The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: When the Bani Isra'il disobeyed Allah Ta` ala, got involved in sins and misdeeds and killed their noble prophets, Allah Ta` ala set King Nebuchadnezzar on them. He was a fire-worshipper who ruled Baytul-Maqdis for seven hundred years.\nAnd when the Qur’ an says: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ أُولَاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَا أُولِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ (So, when came the time appointed for the first of the two, We sent upon you some servants belonging to Us having strong aggressive power - 17:5), it means this event. The army of Nebuchadnezzar entered the Masjid of al-Quds, killed men, took women and children prisoners and carried away with him all gold, silver and everything of value belonging to Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles. He kept the treasure in his country, Babylon and kept the children of Isra'il as his serfs and slaves for a hundred years making them do hard labor in utter disgrace.\nThen Allah Ta’ ala made a king from among the kings of Persia to stand up against him. He conquered Babylon, freed the remnants of Bani Isra'il from the bondage of Nebuchadnezzar and made arrangements to have all valuables he had brought from Baytul-maqdis returned back to it. Then he sternly told the Bani Isra'il that should they, in future, return to disobedience and sin, he too will return the punishment of killing and prison back on them. This is what the verse of the Qur'an: عَسَىٰ رَ‌بُّكُمْ أَن يَرْ‌حَمَكُمْ ۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا (May be your Lord would bestow mercy upon you. And if you do this again, We shall do that again - 17:8) means.\nLater, when the Bani Isra'il had come back to Baytul-maqdis (with lost wealth and property in their possession), they went back to the life of sins and misdeeds. At that time, Allah Ta` ala set the Roman Emperor, Caesar upon them. This is what the verse: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ الْآخِرَ‌ةِ لِيَسُوءُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ (Later, when came the time appointed for the second, [ We sent others ] so that they spoil your faces - 17:7) means. The Roman Emperor launched a two-pronged attack, from the land and the sea. He killed many and many were those he took prisoners. Then he had all this wealth of Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles and took it home. There he had it deposited in the Temple of Gold. This wealth is still there, and there it will remain until comes the Mahdi who would bring these back to Baytul-maqdis on one hundred and seventy thousand boats and it will be at this place that Allah Ta’ ala will assemble everyone, former and later. (Lengthy Hadith as reported by al-Qurtubi in his Tafsir)\nIt appears in Bayan al-Qur'an, that the two events mentioned in the Qur'an refer to the disobedience of two Divine Codes of Law, first the disobedience to the Code brought by Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and, then, after the advent of Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) the disobedience to the Code brought by him. Thus, all events described above can be considered as relevant to the first disobedience. Now that we have gone through the details of the events, we can turn to the explanation of the verses cited above.\nCommentary\nThe outcome of the events mentioned above is that Allah Ta’ ala had decreed that the Bani Isra'il will be successful, having the best of both worlds, the material and the spiritual, as long as they continue to obey Allah. But, whenever they deviate from the dictates of Faith, they shall be put to disgrace, and that they would be subjected to punishment at the hands of enemies and disbelievers. Then, not only that the enemies will run over them destroying their lives and properties, but it would also happen that their Qiblah, their sacred Baytul-Maqdis, will also not remain safe against the onslaught of that enemy. Their disbelieving enemies will barge into the Mosque of Baytul-Maqdis and defile and damage it. This too will be a part of the punishment of Bani Isra'il themselves. The Holy Qur'an has told us about two events relating to them. The first one dates back to the time of Mosaic religious law while the second pertains to the Christian. During both these periods, the Bani Isra'il rebelled against the divine law of the time. In the first case, a disbelieving Magian monarch was made to sit over them, and Baytul-Maqdis, who brought great destruction upon them. In the second case, a Roman emperor was set against them who killed and pillaged and made Baytul-Maqdis all demolished and rendered desolate. And along with this description, it has also been mentioned that the Bani Isra'il - when, on both occasions, they repented from their misdeeds resolving not to go near them again - Allah Ta` ala reinstated their country, wealth and children."

Everyone knows that. As for disbelieving human beings and the jinn, they obviously do not say it. Similarly, there are other things in this universe about which it is said that they are insensate, devoid of reason and intelligence. How do we rationalize their act of saying Tasbih? Some ` Ulama' say that their Tasbih is circumstantial, state-articulated, the testimony of their state of being - because, the collective condition of everything other than Allah Ta’ ala is telling us that it is neither permanent existence-wise nor survival-wise. This whole ongoing condition has been activated under the power and control of some supreme power - this testimony is its Tasbih.\nBut, other investigative scholars say that volitional Tasbih of Allah is particular with angels and believing jinns and human beings. But, in terms of the state of His orientation towards what He has created, Allah Ta` ala has cast every particle of this universe into the mould of a chanter of His glory. As regards those who do not believe, or do not believe in in-stitutional religion, they too generally subscribe to God and His greatness. Then, there are materialists, atheists, and modern-day communists who do not obviously subscribe to the existence of God. But, the truth of the matter is that the very existence of theirs, inclusive of all that constitutes it, is compulsively busy glorifying Allah - just as trees, rocks and dust and a zillion other things are busy recounting the glory of the most true Allah. But, this act of glorification, this Tasbih they are all engaged in, is built-in, compulsively ingrained and is responding to the call of the creational imperative. Common people do not hear it. The statement of the Qur'an: وَلَـٰكِن لَّا تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ , (but you do not understand their extolling [ the act of glorifying Allah ] - 17:44) proves that this originally and elementally ingrained act of extolling Allah performed by everything en masse is something common people cannot understand. As far as circumstantially discernible act of extolling is concerned, intelligent people can identify it readily. This tells us that the act of extolling we are talking about is not simply a testimony of the incumbent's state of existence in the universe. It is real - though, beyond our comprehension. (As mentioned by al-Qurtubi)\nAs for the phenomenon of pebbles saying tasbih (glory be to Allah) in the blessed hand of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and which was clearly heard by the noble Sahabah, it is obviously a miracle. But, Shaykh Jalaluddin as-Suyuti while explaining this Hadith in al-Khasais al-Kubra has said that pebbles saying tasbih is not the miracle of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . As regards pebbles, they say tasbih wherever they are. In fact, what is his miracle is that once the pebbles were in his blessed hand that tasbih said by them became audible.\nImam al-Qurtubi has declared this refinement as weightier and has supported it with many proofs from the Qur'an, and Sunnah. For example, it was said about Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) in Surah Sad: إِنَّا سَخَّرْ‌نَا الْجِبَالَ مَعَهُ يُسَبِّحْنَ بِالْعَشِيِّ وَالْإِشْرَ‌اقِ (We subjugated the mountains with him which used to glorify Allah, evening and morning - 48:18). And it was said about rocks in a verse of Surah al-Baqarah: وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّـهِ (and there are still others [ rocks ] which fall down in fear of Allah - 2:74). This proves that rocks have consciousness, sense and the fear of Allah. Then, refuting Christians calling Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) Son of God, it was said in a verse of Surah Maryam:\tوَتَخِرُّ‌ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ وَلَدًا (and the mountains fall down crumbling that they attribute to the Rahman [ Most-Merciful Allah ] a son - 19:90, 91). Again, it is evident that mountains crumbling in fear are indicative of their consciousness and sense. And once it is conceded that they have sense and consciousness, the saying of tasbih by them should not be considered something improbable.\nSayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ said, \"a mountain says to the other mountain, 'say, 0 brother, has a man ever gone across you, someone who was good at remembering Allah?' If it says, 'yes,' this mountain is pleased with him.\" For his proof, Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn 'Mas` ud ؓ recited the verse: وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنُ وَلَدًا (And they say, \"the Rahman [ Most-Merciful Allah ] has taken a son\" - 19:88). After that, he said, \"this verse proves it that mountains are affected by listening to words of blasphemy (kufr) and are, thereupon, seized by fear. This being the truth, do you think that they listen to what is false and do not listen to what is true (haqq), do not hear Allah being remembered (dhikr) and are not affected by it?\" (Qurtubi with reference to Raqa'iq ibn Mubarak) And the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"there is no jinn, man, tree, rock and common clod of earth that hears the call of the Muezzin (mu'adhdhin), and does not bear witness to his faith and righteousness on the day of Qiyamah.\" (Mu'atta Imam Malik and Sunan Ibn Majah on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ .\nImam al-Bukhari (رح) has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ ، who said, \"we used to hear the sound of tasbih (glory to Allah) said by the food when it was being eaten.\" And a variant appears in another report where it is said, \"when we ate with the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، we used to hear the sound of tasbih said by the food.\" And as narrated by Sayyidna Jabir ibn Samurah ؓ ، it appears in Sahih Muslim that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"I know the rock of Makkah al-Mukarramah that used to say 'salam' to me before the call of prophet-hood - and I know it even now.\" Some say, 'the reference is to al-Hajar al-Aswad.' Allah knows best.\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) has said that Hadith reports relating to such matters abound. As for the story of Ustuwanah Hannanah (the dried tree serving as a column for support when the Holy Prophet ﷺ gave his Khutbah in the Masjid), it is common knowledge among Muslims all over the world. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ bypassed it while starting to deliver his Khutbah from a regular mimbar (stepped-platform), the noble Sahabah heard the sound of wailing coming from it.\nAfter all these reports, why should it remain so far out to realize that everything in the heavens and the earth has consciousness and sense and that everything really glorifies Allah. Ibrahim (رح) says that this tasbih is universal. It includes the animate and the inanimate both. So much so that the least sound made by the panels of doors are not devoid of tasbih. Imam al-Qurtubi has said, 'If this glorification of Allah was a state-articulated tasbih, why was it made so particular to Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) in the verse referred to a little earlier?

This being the truth, do you think that they listen to what is false and do not listen to what is true (haqq), do not hear Allah being remembered (dhikr) and are not affected by it?\" (Qurtubi with reference to Raqa'iq ibn Mubarak) And the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"there is no jinn, man, tree, rock and common clod of earth that hears the call of the Muezzin (mu'adhdhin), and does not bear witness to his faith and righteousness on the day of Qiyamah.\" (Mu'atta Imam Malik and Sunan Ibn Majah on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ .\nImam al-Bukhari (رح) has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ ، who said, \"we used to hear the sound of tasbih (glory to Allah) said by the food when it was being eaten.\" And a variant appears in another report where it is said, \"when we ate with the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، we used to hear the sound of tasbih said by the food.\" And as narrated by Sayyidna Jabir ibn Samurah ؓ ، it appears in Sahih Muslim that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"I know the rock of Makkah al-Mukarramah that used to say 'salam' to me before the call of prophet-hood - and I know it even now.\" Some say, 'the reference is to al-Hajar al-Aswad.' Allah knows best.\nImam al-Qurtubi (رح) has said that Hadith reports relating to such matters abound. As for the story of Ustuwanah Hannanah (the dried tree serving as a column for support when the Holy Prophet ﷺ gave his Khutbah in the Masjid), it is common knowledge among Muslims all over the world. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ bypassed it while starting to deliver his Khutbah from a regular mimbar (stepped-platform), the noble Sahabah heard the sound of wailing coming from it.\nAfter all these reports, why should it remain so far out to realize that everything in the heavens and the earth has consciousness and sense and that everything really glorifies Allah. Ibrahim (رح) says that this tasbih is universal. It includes the animate and the inanimate both. So much so that the least sound made by the panels of doors are not devoid of tasbih. Imam al-Qurtubi has said, 'If this glorification of Allah was a state-articulated tasbih, why was it made so particular to Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) in the verse referred to a little earlier? A state-articulated tasbih is something every discerning human being can sense out from everything. This makes it obvious that this tasbih was spoken, verbally and audibly."

      "text": "Sequence of Verses\nVerses 2 and 3 featuring the statement: (We made it guidance for the children of Bani Isra'il) exhorted the Bani Isra'il to follow and obey the Divine Law. The verses that follow warn and admonish them on their disobedience. These verses mention two events relating to the Bani Isra'il so that they serve as a lesson. Tuned to sin and disobedience, first they increased the tempo of their hostility. Allah Ta` ala set their enemies upon them. They shook them up. The Jews got the message, cut down on their mischief and gave the impression of having been corrected. But, soon after, the same lust for mischief and misdeeds overtook them. So then, Allah Ta’ ala had them punished at the hands of their enemies. The Qur'an mentions two events while history carries six like these:\n1.\tThe first event came to pass some time after the demise of Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the founder of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, when the ruler of Baytul-maqdis became irreligious and corrupt. The ruler of Egypt attacked him and took away the gold and silver of Baytul-maqdis. But, he did not demolish the city and the Masjid.\n2.\tThe second event relates to the period nearly four hundred years after that. Some Jews settled in Baytul-maqdis started idol-worship while the rest began disputing among themselves. This ill omen prompted another ruler of Egypt to attack them which somewhat affected the city and the Masjid both. After that, their condition took a turn for the better.\n3.\tThe third event came to pass after some years when Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon ransacked Baytul-maqdis. He conquered the city, looted property and took back a lot of people as prisoners of war. When he left, he had a member of the family of the former king appointed a ruler of the city as his deputy.\n4.\tWhen this new king, who worshipped idols and was corrupt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, he returned, killed people, destroyed property en masse and burned the city razing it to rubbles. This happened nearly four hundred and fifteen years after the construction of the Masjid. After that, the Jews went out as exiles to Babylon where they lived in disgrace for seventy years. After that, the King of Iran attacked the King of Babylon and conquered it. Then the King of Iran showed mercy to the Jewish expatriates and ordered that they should be sent back to Syria along with things looted from them. Now the Jews had repented having forsaken their habitual sins and misdeeds. When they resettled there, they restored the original structure of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa with the support of the King of Iran.\n5.\tThen came the fifth event. When the Jews had peace and prosperity once again, the first thing they forgot was their past. They returned to the kind of evil deeds they were used to. Then, it so happened that, one hundred and seventy years before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the king who had founded Antakiah (Antioch) attacked, killed forty thousand Jews and took with him another forty thousand as prisoners and slaves, even desecrated the Masjid though its structure remained safe. But, later, the successors of that king rendered the city and the Masjid totally denuded. Soon after this, Baytul-maqdis came under the authority of Roman kings. They put the Masjid back into shape and it was after eight years that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was born.\n6.\tForty years after the physical ascension of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the Jews chose to rebel against their Roman rulers. The Romans destroyed the city and the Masjid once again relegating it to what it was. The king at that time was called Titus who was neither Jewish nor Christian because long after him Constantine I was a Christian. From that time to the time of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، this Masjid lay desolate until he had it reconstructed. These six events have been reported in Tafsir Bayan al-Qur'an with reference to Tafsir Haqqani.\nNow, it is difficult to precisely determine as to which two out of those mentioned above are the two events mentioned by the Holy Qur’ an. But, as obvious, the events that are major and serious among these, in which the Jews were far too wicked and more seriously punished too, should be taken as the likely ones. The fourth and the sixth event seem to be fit for such application. At this point, a lengthy Hadith narrated by Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ، with its chains of authority ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، has been reported in Tafsir al-Qurtubi. It also helps in determining that these two events mean the fourth and the sixth event. The translation of this lengthy Hadith is given below:\nSayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ if Baytul-maqdis was a great Masjid in the sight of Allah. He said that it was the most distinct house of Worship in the world, the greatest of all houses, which Allah Ta’ ala made for Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the son of Dawud, peace be on both, with gold, silver and precious stones like ruby and emerald. The manner in which this happened was, when Sulayman (علیہ السلام) started its construction, Allah Ta` ala made the Jinn subservient to him. The Jinn collected this gold, silver and precious stones and used them in the making of the Masjid. Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ' says that he, then, asked as to where and how did all that gold, silver and precious stones go out of Baytul-Maqdis? The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: When the Bani Isra'il disobeyed Allah Ta` ala, got involved in sins and misdeeds and killed their noble prophets, Allah Ta` ala set King Nebuchadnezzar on them. He was a fire-worshipper who ruled Baytul-Maqdis for seven hundred years.\nAnd when the Qur’ an says: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ أُولَاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَا أُولِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ (So, when came the time appointed for the first of the two, We sent upon you some servants belonging to Us having strong aggressive power - 17:5), it means this event. The army of Nebuchadnezzar entered the Masjid of al-Quds, killed men, took women and children prisoners and carried away with him all gold, silver and everything of value belonging to Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles. He kept the treasure in his country, Babylon and kept the children of Isra'il as his serfs and slaves for a hundred years making them do hard labor in utter disgrace.\nThen Allah Ta’ ala made a king from among the kings of Persia to stand up against him. He conquered Babylon, freed the remnants of Bani Isra'il from the bondage of Nebuchadnezzar and made arrangements to have all valuables he had brought from Baytul-maqdis returned back to it. Then he sternly told the Bani Isra'il that should they, in future, return to disobedience and sin, he too will return the punishment of killing and prison back on them. This is what the verse of the Qur'an: عَسَىٰ رَ‌بُّكُمْ أَن يَرْ‌حَمَكُمْ ۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا (May be your Lord would bestow mercy upon you. And if you do this again, We shall do that again - 17:8) means.\nLater, when the Bani Isra'il had come back to Baytul-maqdis (with lost wealth and property in their possession), they went back to the life of sins and misdeeds. At that time, Allah Ta` ala set the Roman Emperor, Caesar upon them. This is what the verse: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ الْآخِرَ‌ةِ لِيَسُوءُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ (Later, when came the time appointed for the second, [ We sent others ] so that they spoil your faces - 17:7) means. The Roman Emperor launched a two-pronged attack, from the land and the sea. He killed many and many were those he took prisoners. Then he had all this wealth of Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles and took it home. There he had it deposited in the Temple of Gold. This wealth is still there, and there it will remain until comes the Mahdi who would bring these back to Baytul-maqdis on one hundred and seventy thousand boats and it will be at this place that Allah Ta’ ala will assemble everyone, former and later. (Lengthy Hadith as reported by al-Qurtubi in his Tafsir)\nIt appears in Bayan al-Qur'an, that the two events mentioned in the Qur'an refer to the disobedience of two Divine Codes of Law, first the disobedience to the Code brought by Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and, then, after the advent of Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) the disobedience to the Code brought by him. Thus, all events described above can be considered as relevant to the first disobedience. Now that we have gone through the details of the events, we can turn to the explanation of the verses cited above.\nCommentary\nThe outcome of the events mentioned above is that Allah Ta’ ala had decreed that the Bani Isra'il will be successful, having the best of both worlds, the material and the spiritual, as long as they continue to obey Allah. But, whenever they deviate from the dictates of Faith, they shall be put to disgrace, and that they would be subjected to punishment at the hands of enemies and disbelievers. Then, not only that the enemies will run over them destroying their lives and properties, but it would also happen that their Qiblah, their sacred Baytul-Maqdis, will also not remain safe against the onslaught of that enemy. Their disbelieving enemies will barge into the Mosque of Baytul-Maqdis and defile and damage it. This too will be a part of the punishment of Bani Isra'il themselves. The Holy Qur'an has told us about two events relating to them. The first one dates back to the time of Mosaic religious law while the second pertains to the Christian. During both these periods, the Bani Isra'il rebelled against the divine law of the time. In the first case, a disbelieving Magian monarch was made to sit over them, and Baytul-Maqdis, who brought great destruction upon them. In the second case, a Roman emperor was set against them who killed and pillaged and made Baytul-Maqdis all demolished and rendered desolate. And along with this description, it has also been mentioned that the Bani Isra'il - when, on both occasions, they repented from their misdeeds resolving not to go near them again - Allah Ta` ala reinstated their country, wealth and children."

She will say things which may cause you pain.\" He said, \"no, Allah Ta` ala will put a curtain between me and her.\" So, she reached there but when she could not see the Holy Prophet ﷺ anywhere around, she turned towards Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ and said, your companion has satirized us in poetry.\" Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ said, \"By Allah, he is no composer of poetry, much less that of the kind in which people are satirized (hajw).\" Thereupon, she left in a huff saying, \"you are no more than a verifier for him.\" After she was gone, Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ submitted, \"didn't she see you?\" He said, \"as long as she was here, an angel kept obstructing the view between me and her.\"\nA Qur'anic formula of remaining hidden from enemy sight\n'On occasions when the Holy Prophet ﷺ wished to remain hidden from the sight of the Mushriks,' says Sayyidna Ka` b ؓ ، 'he would recite three verses of the Holy Qur’ an. Such was its effect that the disbelievers were unable to see him.' Those three verses are:\n1. \tإِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرً‌ا (Surely, We have put covers on their hearts, so that they do not understand it, and deafness in their ears - Surah al-Kahf, 18:57).\n2. أُولَـٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ طَبَعَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِ‌هِمْ (Those are the ones Allah has put a seal on whose hearts and hearing and vision - Surah an-Nahl, 16:108).\n3. أَفَرَ‌أَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَـٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ وَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِ‌هِ غِشَاوَةً (Have you seen the one who has taken his own desire as god while Allah has let him go astray because of knowledge [ his or His ] and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and placed over his vision a veil - Surah al-Jathiyah, 45:23).\nSayyidna Ka'b ؓ says that he related this thing about the Holy Prophet ﷺ to a Syrian who had to go to adjoining Byzantium on a certain business. He went there and stayed for a long time until the local disbelievers started harassing him. When he escaped from there, they pursued him.

It so happened that he was put under arrest by the disbelievers of Dailam. For some time he remained under detention with them. One day he got his chance to escape.

      "text": "Commentary\nThe word: يَدْعُوكُمْ (He will call you) in: يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ (on a day when He will call you, and you will respond praising Him - 52) is a derivation from: دُعَاء (dua' ) which means to call out for someone by announcing it vocally. The sense is that the day when Allah Ta’ ala will call everyone to come to the plains of Resurrection, this calling will be through Angel Israfil. When he sounds the second trumpet, the dead will come alive and assemble on the plains of Resurrection. It is also possible that, once alive, a call goes through to all of them to assemble there. (Qurtubi)\nIn a Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"On the day of Qiyamah, you will be called out with your name and the name of your father, therefore, give yourself good names (avoiding the absurd ones).\" (Qurtubi)\nEven disbelievers will rise praising Allah on the day of Resurrection\nThe word: اِستِجَابَۃ (istijabah) in: فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ (and you will respond praising Him - 52) means to respond on being called by someone and be present before him. The sense is when you will be called to present your-selves on the plains of Resurrection, all of you will obey that call and assemble there. The word: بِحَمْدِهِ (bihamdihi: praising Him) is the state of the nominative pronoun in: تسْتَجِيبُونَ (tastajibun: you will respond) which releases the sense of hamidin (حَامِدِین) that is, those praising Him. Thus, the outcome is that all of them will present themselves praising Allah while coming to those fateful plains.\nAs outwardly obvious, the verse does seem to indicate that this will be the state of all, believers or disbelievers - they both will rise praising Allah. But, the real addressees here are the disbelievers. It is about them that it is being said they all will rise praising Allah. From among Tafsir authorities, Sayyidna Said ibn Jubayr has said that the disbelievers too will rise from their graves saying: سُبحَانَکَ وَ بِحَمدِکَ (Pure are You and to You belong all praises), but their act of praising at that hour will be of no use to them. (Qurtubi) The reason is not far to see. When these people see life after death, the words of praise for Allah will escape their mouth involuntarily. This will be no deed deserving recompense.\nSome commentators have said that this state has been particularized with believers. They argue that, regarding the disbelievers, the Qur'an has only this to say: (1) When they rise, they will say, يَا وَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْ‌قَدِنَا (Woe be to us! Who made us rise from our resting-place? – Surah Ya Sin, 36:52). (2) And according to another verse, they will say, يَا حَسْرَ‌تَىٰ عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّ‌طتُ فِي جَنبِ اللَّـهِ (0 my remorse [ is boundless ] over what I have neglected on the side of [ obedience to ] Allah! - Surah az-Zumar, 39:56).\nBut, the truth of the matter is that there is no likelihood of a contra-diction between these two sayings. May be, in the beginning, all rise praising. Later, when disbelievers are separated from believers as said in Surah Ya Sin: وَامْتَازُوا الْيَوْمَ أَيُّهَا الْمُجْرِ‌مُونَ (But today, 0 criminals, you stand out distinctly apart - 36:59), they will also say what appears in the cited verses. Then, it stands proved from many explications of the Qur'an, and Sunnah that stations of Resurrection will be different with a corresponding difference in the states and conditions of people in each of these. Imam al-Qurtubi has said that rising in Resurrection will begin with the praise of Allah with everyone doing it when rising and on it will end all matters. This is as it was already said: وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ رَ‌بِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (And matters between them have been settled in accordance with the truth and it was said: All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds - az-Zumar, 39:75)"

Thereupon, this verse was revealed.\nAnd according to the interpretation of Imam al-Qurtubi, this verse contains a guideline for Muslims as to how they should address each other. It suggests that they should not speak harshly at the time of mutual difference, for this is a trap door through which the Shaitan pushes them into mutual infighting and disorder."

      "text": "Sequence of Verses\nVerses 2 and 3 featuring the statement: (We made it guidance for the children of Bani Isra'il) exhorted the Bani Isra'il to follow and obey the Divine Law. The verses that follow warn and admonish them on their disobedience. These verses mention two events relating to the Bani Isra'il so that they serve as a lesson. Tuned to sin and disobedience, first they increased the tempo of their hostility. Allah Ta` ala set their enemies upon them. They shook them up. The Jews got the message, cut down on their mischief and gave the impression of having been corrected. But, soon after, the same lust for mischief and misdeeds overtook them. So then, Allah Ta’ ala had them punished at the hands of their enemies. The Qur'an mentions two events while history carries six like these:\n1.\tThe first event came to pass some time after the demise of Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the founder of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, when the ruler of Baytul-maqdis became irreligious and corrupt. The ruler of Egypt attacked him and took away the gold and silver of Baytul-maqdis. But, he did not demolish the city and the Masjid.\n2.\tThe second event relates to the period nearly four hundred years after that. Some Jews settled in Baytul-maqdis started idol-worship while the rest began disputing among themselves. This ill omen prompted another ruler of Egypt to attack them which somewhat affected the city and the Masjid both. After that, their condition took a turn for the better.\n3.\tThe third event came to pass after some years when Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon ransacked Baytul-maqdis. He conquered the city, looted property and took back a lot of people as prisoners of war. When he left, he had a member of the family of the former king appointed a ruler of the city as his deputy.\n4.\tWhen this new king, who worshipped idols and was corrupt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, he returned, killed people, destroyed property en masse and burned the city razing it to rubbles. This happened nearly four hundred and fifteen years after the construction of the Masjid. After that, the Jews went out as exiles to Babylon where they lived in disgrace for seventy years. After that, the King of Iran attacked the King of Babylon and conquered it. Then the King of Iran showed mercy to the Jewish expatriates and ordered that they should be sent back to Syria along with things looted from them. Now the Jews had repented having forsaken their habitual sins and misdeeds. When they resettled there, they restored the original structure of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa with the support of the King of Iran.\n5.\tThen came the fifth event. When the Jews had peace and prosperity once again, the first thing they forgot was their past. They returned to the kind of evil deeds they were used to. Then, it so happened that, one hundred and seventy years before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the king who had founded Antakiah (Antioch) attacked, killed forty thousand Jews and took with him another forty thousand as prisoners and slaves, even desecrated the Masjid though its structure remained safe. But, later, the successors of that king rendered the city and the Masjid totally denuded. Soon after this, Baytul-maqdis came under the authority of Roman kings. They put the Masjid back into shape and it was after eight years that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was born.\n6.\tForty years after the physical ascension of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the Jews chose to rebel against their Roman rulers. The Romans destroyed the city and the Masjid once again relegating it to what it was. The king at that time was called Titus who was neither Jewish nor Christian because long after him Constantine I was a Christian. From that time to the time of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، this Masjid lay desolate until he had it reconstructed. These six events have been reported in Tafsir Bayan al-Qur'an with reference to Tafsir Haqqani.\nNow, it is difficult to precisely determine as to which two out of those mentioned above are the two events mentioned by the Holy Qur’ an. But, as obvious, the events that are major and serious among these, in which the Jews were far too wicked and more seriously punished too, should be taken as the likely ones. The fourth and the sixth event seem to be fit for such application. At this point, a lengthy Hadith narrated by Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ، with its chains of authority ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، has been reported in Tafsir al-Qurtubi. It also helps in determining that these two events mean the fourth and the sixth event. The translation of this lengthy Hadith is given below:\nSayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ if Baytul-maqdis was a great Masjid in the sight of Allah. He said that it was the most distinct house of Worship in the world, the greatest of all houses, which Allah Ta’ ala made for Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the son of Dawud, peace be on both, with gold, silver and precious stones like ruby and emerald. The manner in which this happened was, when Sulayman (علیہ السلام) started its construction, Allah Ta` ala made the Jinn subservient to him. The Jinn collected this gold, silver and precious stones and used them in the making of the Masjid. Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ' says that he, then, asked as to where and how did all that gold, silver and precious stones go out of Baytul-Maqdis? The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: When the Bani Isra'il disobeyed Allah Ta` ala, got involved in sins and misdeeds and killed their noble prophets, Allah Ta` ala set King Nebuchadnezzar on them. He was a fire-worshipper who ruled Baytul-Maqdis for seven hundred years.\nAnd when the Qur’ an says: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ أُولَاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَا أُولِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ (So, when came the time appointed for the first of the two, We sent upon you some servants belonging to Us having strong aggressive power - 17:5), it means this event. The army of Nebuchadnezzar entered the Masjid of al-Quds, killed men, took women and children prisoners and carried away with him all gold, silver and everything of value belonging to Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles. He kept the treasure in his country, Babylon and kept the children of Isra'il as his serfs and slaves for a hundred years making them do hard labor in utter disgrace.\nThen Allah Ta’ ala made a king from among the kings of Persia to stand up against him. He conquered Babylon, freed the remnants of Bani Isra'il from the bondage of Nebuchadnezzar and made arrangements to have all valuables he had brought from Baytul-maqdis returned back to it. Then he sternly told the Bani Isra'il that should they, in future, return to disobedience and sin, he too will return the punishment of killing and prison back on them. This is what the verse of the Qur'an: عَسَىٰ رَ‌بُّكُمْ أَن يَرْ‌حَمَكُمْ ۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا (May be your Lord would bestow mercy upon you. And if you do this again, We shall do that again - 17:8) means.\nLater, when the Bani Isra'il had come back to Baytul-maqdis (with lost wealth and property in their possession), they went back to the life of sins and misdeeds. At that time, Allah Ta` ala set the Roman Emperor, Caesar upon them. This is what the verse: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ الْآخِرَ‌ةِ لِيَسُوءُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ (Later, when came the time appointed for the second, [ We sent others ] so that they spoil your faces - 17:7) means. The Roman Emperor launched a two-pronged attack, from the land and the sea. He killed many and many were those he took prisoners. Then he had all this wealth of Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles and took it home. There he had it deposited in the Temple of Gold. This wealth is still there, and there it will remain until comes the Mahdi who would bring these back to Baytul-maqdis on one hundred and seventy thousand boats and it will be at this place that Allah Ta’ ala will assemble everyone, former and later. (Lengthy Hadith as reported by al-Qurtubi in his Tafsir)\nIt appears in Bayan al-Qur'an, that the two events mentioned in the Qur'an refer to the disobedience of two Divine Codes of Law, first the disobedience to the Code brought by Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and, then, after the advent of Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) the disobedience to the Code brought by him. Thus, all events described above can be considered as relevant to the first disobedience. Now that we have gone through the details of the events, we can turn to the explanation of the verses cited above.\nCommentary\nThe outcome of the events mentioned above is that Allah Ta’ ala had decreed that the Bani Isra'il will be successful, having the best of both worlds, the material and the spiritual, as long as they continue to obey Allah. But, whenever they deviate from the dictates of Faith, they shall be put to disgrace, and that they would be subjected to punishment at the hands of enemies and disbelievers. Then, not only that the enemies will run over them destroying their lives and properties, but it would also happen that their Qiblah, their sacred Baytul-Maqdis, will also not remain safe against the onslaught of that enemy. Their disbelieving enemies will barge into the Mosque of Baytul-Maqdis and defile and damage it. This too will be a part of the punishment of Bani Isra'il themselves. The Holy Qur'an has told us about two events relating to them. The first one dates back to the time of Mosaic religious law while the second pertains to the Christian. During both these periods, the Bani Isra'il rebelled against the divine law of the time. In the first case, a disbelieving Magian monarch was made to sit over them, and Baytul-Maqdis, who brought great destruction upon them. In the second case, a Roman emperor was set against them who killed and pillaged and made Baytul-Maqdis all demolished and rendered desolate. And along with this description, it has also been mentioned that the Bani Isra'il - when, on both occasions, they repented from their misdeeds resolving not to go near them again - Allah Ta` ala reinstated their country, wealth and children."

      "text": "Sequence of Verses\nVerses 2 and 3 featuring the statement: (We made it guidance for the children of Bani Isra'il) exhorted the Bani Isra'il to follow and obey the Divine Law. The verses that follow warn and admonish them on their disobedience. These verses mention two events relating to the Bani Isra'il so that they serve as a lesson. Tuned to sin and disobedience, first they increased the tempo of their hostility. Allah Ta` ala set their enemies upon them. They shook them up. The Jews got the message, cut down on their mischief and gave the impression of having been corrected. But, soon after, the same lust for mischief and misdeeds overtook them. So then, Allah Ta’ ala had them punished at the hands of their enemies. The Qur'an mentions two events while history carries six like these:\n1.\tThe first event came to pass some time after the demise of Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the founder of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, when the ruler of Baytul-maqdis became irreligious and corrupt. The ruler of Egypt attacked him and took away the gold and silver of Baytul-maqdis. But, he did not demolish the city and the Masjid.\n2.\tThe second event relates to the period nearly four hundred years after that. Some Jews settled in Baytul-maqdis started idol-worship while the rest began disputing among themselves. This ill omen prompted another ruler of Egypt to attack them which somewhat affected the city and the Masjid both. After that, their condition took a turn for the better.\n3.\tThe third event came to pass after some years when Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon ransacked Baytul-maqdis. He conquered the city, looted property and took back a lot of people as prisoners of war. When he left, he had a member of the family of the former king appointed a ruler of the city as his deputy.\n4.\tWhen this new king, who worshipped idols and was corrupt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, he returned, killed people, destroyed property en masse and burned the city razing it to rubbles. This happened nearly four hundred and fifteen years after the construction of the Masjid. After that, the Jews went out as exiles to Babylon where they lived in disgrace for seventy years. After that, the King of Iran attacked the King of Babylon and conquered it. Then the King of Iran showed mercy to the Jewish expatriates and ordered that they should be sent back to Syria along with things looted from them. Now the Jews had repented having forsaken their habitual sins and misdeeds. When they resettled there, they restored the original structure of Al-Masjid al-Aqsa with the support of the King of Iran.\n5.\tThen came the fifth event. When the Jews had peace and prosperity once again, the first thing they forgot was their past. They returned to the kind of evil deeds they were used to. Then, it so happened that, one hundred and seventy years before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the king who had founded Antakiah (Antioch) attacked, killed forty thousand Jews and took with him another forty thousand as prisoners and slaves, even desecrated the Masjid though its structure remained safe. But, later, the successors of that king rendered the city and the Masjid totally denuded. Soon after this, Baytul-maqdis came under the authority of Roman kings. They put the Masjid back into shape and it was after eight years that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was born.\n6.\tForty years after the physical ascension of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) ، the Jews chose to rebel against their Roman rulers. The Romans destroyed the city and the Masjid once again relegating it to what it was. The king at that time was called Titus who was neither Jewish nor Christian because long after him Constantine I was a Christian. From that time to the time of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، this Masjid lay desolate until he had it reconstructed. These six events have been reported in Tafsir Bayan al-Qur'an with reference to Tafsir Haqqani.\nNow, it is difficult to precisely determine as to which two out of those mentioned above are the two events mentioned by the Holy Qur’ an. But, as obvious, the events that are major and serious among these, in which the Jews were far too wicked and more seriously punished too, should be taken as the likely ones. The fourth and the sixth event seem to be fit for such application. At this point, a lengthy Hadith narrated by Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ، with its chains of authority ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، has been reported in Tafsir al-Qurtubi. It also helps in determining that these two events mean the fourth and the sixth event. The translation of this lengthy Hadith is given below:\nSayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ says that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ if Baytul-maqdis was a great Masjid in the sight of Allah. He said that it was the most distinct house of Worship in the world, the greatest of all houses, which Allah Ta’ ala made for Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، the son of Dawud, peace be on both, with gold, silver and precious stones like ruby and emerald. The manner in which this happened was, when Sulayman (علیہ السلام) started its construction, Allah Ta` ala made the Jinn subservient to him. The Jinn collected this gold, silver and precious stones and used them in the making of the Masjid. Sayyidna Hudhayfah ؓ ' says that he, then, asked as to where and how did all that gold, silver and precious stones go out of Baytul-Maqdis? The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: When the Bani Isra'il disobeyed Allah Ta` ala, got involved in sins and misdeeds and killed their noble prophets, Allah Ta` ala set King Nebuchadnezzar on them. He was a fire-worshipper who ruled Baytul-Maqdis for seven hundred years.\nAnd when the Qur’ an says: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ أُولَاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَا أُولِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ (So, when came the time appointed for the first of the two, We sent upon you some servants belonging to Us having strong aggressive power - 17:5), it means this event. The army of Nebuchadnezzar entered the Masjid of al-Quds, killed men, took women and children prisoners and carried away with him all gold, silver and everything of value belonging to Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles. He kept the treasure in his country, Babylon and kept the children of Isra'il as his serfs and slaves for a hundred years making them do hard labor in utter disgrace.\nThen Allah Ta’ ala made a king from among the kings of Persia to stand up against him. He conquered Babylon, freed the remnants of Bani Isra'il from the bondage of Nebuchadnezzar and made arrangements to have all valuables he had brought from Baytul-maqdis returned back to it. Then he sternly told the Bani Isra'il that should they, in future, return to disobedience and sin, he too will return the punishment of killing and prison back on them. This is what the verse of the Qur'an: عَسَىٰ رَ‌بُّكُمْ أَن يَرْ‌حَمَكُمْ ۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا (May be your Lord would bestow mercy upon you. And if you do this again, We shall do that again - 17:8) means.\nLater, when the Bani Isra'il had come back to Baytul-maqdis (with lost wealth and property in their possession), they went back to the life of sins and misdeeds. At that time, Allah Ta` ala set the Roman Emperor, Caesar upon them. This is what the verse: فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ الْآخِرَ‌ةِ لِيَسُوءُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ (Later, when came the time appointed for the second, [ We sent others ] so that they spoil your faces - 17:7) means. The Roman Emperor launched a two-pronged attack, from the land and the sea. He killed many and many were those he took prisoners. Then he had all this wealth of Baytul-maqdis loaded on one hundred and seventy thousand vehicles and took it home. There he had it deposited in the Temple of Gold. This wealth is still there, and there it will remain until comes the Mahdi who would bring these back to Baytul-maqdis on one hundred and seventy thousand boats and it will be at this place that Allah Ta’ ala will assemble everyone, former and later. (Lengthy Hadith as reported by al-Qurtubi in his Tafsir)\nIt appears in Bayan al-Qur'an, that the two events mentioned in the Qur'an refer to the disobedience of two Divine Codes of Law, first the disobedience to the Code brought by Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and, then, after the advent of Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) the disobedience to the Code brought by him. Thus, all events described above can be considered as relevant to the first disobedience. Now that we have gone through the details of the events, we can turn to the explanation of the verses cited above.\nCommentary\nThe outcome of the events mentioned above is that Allah Ta’ ala had decreed that the Bani Isra'il will be successful, having the best of both worlds, the material and the spiritual, as long as they continue to obey Allah. But, whenever they deviate from the dictates of Faith, they shall be put to disgrace, and that they would be subjected to punishment at the hands of enemies and disbelievers. Then, not only that the enemies will run over them destroying their lives and properties, but it would also happen that their Qiblah, their sacred Baytul-Maqdis, will also not remain safe against the onslaught of that enemy. Their disbelieving enemies will barge into the Mosque of Baytul-Maqdis and defile and damage it. This too will be a part of the punishment of Bani Isra'il themselves. The Holy Qur'an has told us about two events relating to them. The first one dates back to the time of Mosaic religious law while the second pertains to the Christian. During both these periods, the Bani Isra'il rebelled against the divine law of the time. In the first case, a disbelieving Magian monarch was made to sit over them, and Baytul-Maqdis, who brought great destruction upon them. In the second case, a Roman emperor was set against them who killed and pillaged and made Baytul-Maqdis all demolished and rendered desolate. And along with this description, it has also been mentioned that the Bani Isra'il - when, on both occasions, they repented from their misdeeds resolving not to go near them again - Allah Ta` ala reinstated their country, wealth and children."

      "text": "Commentary\nWhy are the children of 'Adam (علیہ السلام) superior?\nThe last of the verses cited above mentions the superiority of the children of 'Adam over most of the Divine creation. Here, we have to consider two things: (1) What are the attributes and reasons of this superiority? (2) What is the sense of the statement in the verse: 'made them much superior to many of those We created'?\n(1) The first question can be answered in detail by saying that Allah Ta` ala has blessed the children of 'Adam with such multi-dimensional attributes as are not found in many of those He has created. The beauty of form and features, the balance of body, the balance of temperament and the balance of height and built are good examples. These attributes bestowed on human beings are not found in other living forms in that balanced measure. In addition to that, they have been endowed with distinct reason and intelligence through which they get things done up and down in the universe of their experience. Allah Ta’ ala has given them the built-in capability to compound and manufacture, from out of what has been Divinely created, materials and things which serve them in living, moving, eating and wearing in all sorts of ways.\nNo less is their gift of communication, speech, comprehension, under-standing and explanation. This remains unmatched by other living forms. Using signs and symbols to communicate what lies in one's heart and telling others what one thinks and feels through letters and writings are all manifestations of the signal human distinction. Some scholars have said that eating with the fingers of the hand is also a particular human attribute. Other than man, all animals eat with their mouth. The practice of compounding edibles with different things in order to make these delicious and beneficial is the way of human beings alone. Animals eat things that are single and simple. Some would eat raw meat, others would go by grass or some fruit. However, they all eat simples. It is man alone who prepares food through compounding all sorts of solids, liquids, spices and herbs (which has, in our day, assumed the status of the highly publicized art of cuisine). Then, there is the most pronounced superiority of reason and intelligence through which human beings are supposed to recognize their Creator and Master, find out what He likes and dislikes and do what He likes and avoid what He dislikes. Thus, in terms of reason and intelligence, the created have three kinds. Common animals have desires but no reason and intelligence (as we understand it). The angels have reason and intelligence, but do not have desires. Human beings have both. They have reason and intelligence as well as desires. This is the reason why, when he suppresses his desires through reason and intelligence and succeeds in saving himself from indulging in things disliked by Allah Ta’ ala, he reaches a station which is even higher than that of many angels.\n(2) We can now turn to the sense of the statement that the children of 'Adam were made much superior than many of those Allah created. As for the superiority of the children of 'Adam over all created forms in the world, higher and lower, and all animals, it cannot be disputed by any-one. Similarly, the Jinn are like human beings in terms of reason and intelligence. That human beings are superior to them as well is accepted by all.\tWhat remains now is the case of angels. Who is superior, man or angel? What can be authentically said about it is that common righteous believers among human beings, such as the men of Allah, are superior to angels in general. But, special angels, such as Jibra'il and Mika'il and others, are superior to the common righteous believers while special believers, such as the blessed prophets (علیہم السلام) ، are superior even to special angels. As far as disbelievers and sinners among human beings are concerned, they just cannot be compared with angels. In fact, they are not even superior to animals in terms of the real purpose of life, that of seeking success through righteousness. About them, the Holy Qur'an has already given its verdict: أُولَـٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ (They are like cattle. Rather,\nthey are much more misled - 7:179) (Tafsir Mazhari). Allah knows best."

Here, إِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ means a clear book. Then, 'kitab' is called 'imam' for the reason that, in the event of some error or difference, one turns to the book very much like turning to a religious leader who is followed. (Qurtubi)\nAnd it also appears from a Hadith of Tirmidhi as narrated by Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ (Tirmidhi calls it Hasan Gharib) that, 'imam' in this verse means 'kitab.' The words of the Hadith are given below:\nيَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ قال یُدعٰی اَحَدُھُم فَیُعطٰی کِتَابُہ بِیَمَینِہٖ\nExplaining the verse يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ (71), the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself said: One of them will be called and his book of deeds will be given in his right hand. (From a lengthy Hadith)\nIt also stands established from this Hadith that 'imam' has been used here in the sense of 'book', and that 'kitab' signifies the 'book of deeds.' (Maulana Ashraf Thanavi (رح) has, therefore, translated 'imam' as the 'book of deeds' )\nAlso reported from some commentators, including Sayyidna ` Ali al-Murtada ؓ and Mujahid, is the meaning of 'imam' as religious leader. It means that everyone is to be called as the follower of a certain leader - whether they be blessed prophets or their deputies, the Shaykhs and the ` Ulama', or leaders who have been inviting people to error and sin. (Qurtubi)\nGiven this meaning, the sense of the verse would be that everyone will be called by the name of his or her leader and all those so called will be assembled at one place. For example, there will be the followers of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) ، the followers of Sayyidna Musa and Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہم السلام) to and the followers of Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ . Then, possibly the names of those will also be called out who are their direct instructors or leaders (such as ` Ulama' and religious guides).\nThe Book of Deeds\nAs it appears from several verses of the Holy Qur'an, only disbelievers will be given the book of deeds in the left hand. This is as it is said in the verse:إِنَّهُ كَانَ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّـهِ الْعَظِيمِ (Indeed, he was not used to believing in Allah, the Great - al-Haqqah, 69:33) and also in another verse: إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ‌(Indeed, he surmised that he would never return - a1-Inshigaq, 84:14). In the first verse quoted above, faith has been negated explicitly while the second carries a denial of the Hereafter - which too is disbelief after all. This comparative look tells us that those who shall get their book of deeds in the right hand will be the people of faith, pious or sinner. The believer will read his or her book of deeds in delight. In fact, the happy believer will have others read it too. This happiness will be because of having one's 'Iman (faith) intact and because of deliverance from eternal punishment - though, punishment may also come for some deeds.\nHow the book of deeds will be given in the right or the left hand is something not mentioned in the Holy Qur’ an. But, the expression: تَطَاٰیُرُالکُتُبِ - (causing the books fly) has appeared in some Ahadith (reported by Ahmad on the authority of Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ ' ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . And in some narrations of Hadith, it appears that all books of deeds will be there at one place under the ` Arsh (Throne). Then a wind will blow and cause these to fly and reach the hands of people in a manner that some will get it in their right hand and some others in the left.

At this place, the sense is to expel the Holy Prophet ﷺ from his station at Makkah or Madinah. The verse means: Had they done that, their punishment would have been that they themselves would have not been able to live there much longer after you. This is the description of another event. There are two reports about it. One event relates to Madinah al-Tayyibah. The Jews of the city came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . They told him: 'O Abu a1-Qasim, if you are true in your claim to be a prophet, you should go and live in Syria because the land of Syria is the land of al-Mahshar (the Resurrection) and the land of prophets too.' The Holy Prophet ﷺ was somewhat impressed by what they said and when he traveled to Syria at the time of the battle of Tabuk, the idea of taking up residence in Syria was still on his mind. But, the revelation of the verse: وَإِن كَادُوا لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ (And they were likely to harass you - 76) at that time stopped him from doing so. After presenting this report, Ibn Kathir has, however, declared it to be unsatisfactory.\nAs an alternate, he points out to another event which transpired in Makkah al-Mukarramah and which, according to him, is the point of reference in this verse for the fact that this Surah was Makki provided a strong coherence for it. As the event goes, once the Quraysh disbelievers intended to expel the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tfrom Makkah al-Mukarramah.\nThereupon, Allah Ta’ ala revealed the verse: كَادُوا لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ where the Quraysh disbelievers were warned that in the event they expelled the Holy Prophet ﷺ from Makkah, they too would not be sitting in Makkah in peace any longer. This is the event Ibn Kathir considers to be the weightier choice as the point of reference in the verse. Then, he goes on to explain that this warning of the Holy Qur’ an was seen come true by the disbelievers of Makkah with their own eyes. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ migrated from Makkah al-Mukarramah, they were unable to sit there in peace even for a day. It was within a period of a year and six months that Allah Ta` ala made them assemble on the plains of Badr where seventy of their chiefs were killed and their initial aggressive power was broken. Then came the final outcome of the battle of 'Uhud which made them more awe-stricken, and the last confrontation of the battle of al-Ahzab virtually broke their back. It was in the eighth year of Hijrah that the Holy Prophet ﷺ conquered the whole of Makkah al-Mukarramah."

      "text": "Commentary\nSalah is the best defense against enemy hostility\nPrevious verses have mentioned the hostility of the enemies of Islam, the plans they made to hurt and harass the Holy Prophet ﷺ and what was to be done in response. By giving the Holy Prophet ﷺ the command to establish Salah in the verses cited above, it is being suggested that it is the best remedy against the mischief made and pain caused by enemies. This is similar to what has been said more clearly in a verse of Surah al-Hijr: وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُ‌كَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَ‌بِّكَ وَكُن مِّنَ السَّاجِدِينَ. It means: \"And indeed We know that your heart feels distressed for what they say. So, proclaim the purity and glory of your Lord, and be among those who prostrate.\" (Qurtubi)\nThis verse declares devotion to the remembrance of Allah (dhikr) through His praises (hamd) and His glorification (tasbih) and Salah (prayer) as the panacea of pains inflicted by enemies. Dhikr and Salah are special safety shields against their aggressive designs. Then, it is also not far out to believe that staying safe against the pain inflicted by enemies depends on the help and support of Allah Ta` ala. So, the best medium of acquiring this help is Salah as stated in the Holy Qur'an: اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ‌ وَالصَّلَاةِ (Seek help through patience and prayer - 2:153).\nThe injunction of five prayers\nThe majority of leading Tafsir authorities has declared this verse to be a comprehensive injunction for all five daily prayers. The reason is that the word: دُلُوک (duluk) is essentially used in the sense of 'decline' and the decline of the Sun begins at the time of meridian - though, it could also be applied to the sunset. But, at this place, the majority of Sahabah and Tabi'in have taken the word: دُلُوک (duluk) to mean the post-meridian decline of the Sun. (as explained in details by al-Qurtubi, al-Mazhari and Ibn Kathir).\nThe word: غَسَقِ (ghasaq) in the next phrase: إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ means the darkness of the night when it is complete. Imam Malik has reported this very Tafsir of 'ghasaq' from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ .\nThus, within the statement: لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ (between the decline of the Sun and the darkness of the night), four prayers stand covered. These are Zuhr, ` Asr, Maghrib and ` Isha'. And also identified there is the time when two of these prayers begin, that is, the time of Zuhr begins from the decline (zawal) of the Sun and the time of ` Isha' from: غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ (ghasaq al-layl) that is, at the time when the darkness of night is complete. Therefore, the great Imam, Abu Hanifah (رح) has ruled that the time of ` Isha' begins from the time when, after the red glow, the white glow of the evening also disappears. Everyone knows that, close to the sunset, a red glow appears on the western horizon and, soon after this redness, there spreads a sort of whiteness on it. Then, this whiteness too disappears. It is obvious that the darkness of the night will be complete only when the whiteness of the horizon also goes away. Therefore, these words support the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) . Other Imams have ruled that the time of ` Isha' begins after the disappearance of the red glow on the evening horizon and that this is the Tafsir of 'ghasaq al-layl' (the darkness of night).\nIn the next phrase: وَقُرْ‌آنَ الْفَجْرِ‌ (wa Qur’ an al-fajr: translated as 'and the recital at dawn' ), the word: 'Qur’ an' denotes Salah at this place be-cause the Qur'an is an integral part of Salah. Most Tafsir authorities - Ibn Kathir, al-Qurtubi, Mazhari and others - have adopted this very meaning. Therefore, the sense of the verse is that the words: لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ (between the decline of the Sun and the darkness of the night) carried a description of four prayers. Identified now is the fifth prayer, that of Fajr. It has been described separately which is an indicator of the particular importance and merit of this Salah.\nThe word 'mashhud' in the expression: كَانَ مَشْهُودًا (kana mashhuda) has been derived from shahadah that means to be present.' This is a time when, according to clear statements in authentic Ahadith, both groups of angels, those of the night and those of the day, present themselves for Salah. Therefore, it has been called 'mashhud' (hence, translated as 'well-attended' ). The injunction of five prayers has appeared in this verse briefly. It has been explained fully by the Holy Prophet ﷺ through his word and deed - and unless one acts in accordance with this explanation, no one can perform Salah. I just do not know how those who claim to understand the Qur'an without Hadith and the statements of the Rasul of Allah go about making their Salah? Similarly, in this verse, the recital of the Qur’ an within the Salah has also been mentioned briefly. As for its details, it stands proved from the word and deed of the Holy Prophet ﷺ that the recitation in the Fajr prayer should be long - to the measure of strength and ability, less than that in Zuhr and Jumu'ah, average in ` Asr and ` Isha' and very brief in Maghrib. As for the mention of a long recitation in Maghrib and very brief in Fajr in some reports, it stands practically abandoned. Imam al-Qurtubi carries the riwayah of Sahih Muslim in which the recitation of long Surahs like Surah al-A` raf and Mursalat in the Salah of Maghrib, or the recitation of only the Mu'awwadhatain (the last two Surahs) as sufficient in the Salah of Fajr have been reported. He, then, comments: فمتروک بالعمل ولانکارہ علی معاذ التطویل و بامرہ الایٔمۃ بالتخفیف . It means that these incidentals of long recitation in Maghrib and brief in Fajr stand abandoned in the light of the constant practice of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as well as his verbal sayings. (Qurtubi)"

      "text": "The time of the Salah of Tahajjud: Injunctions and rulings\nThe word: فَتَھَجُّد (tahajjud) in: وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ (And during the night, wake up for Salah- 79) has been derived from ھجود :hujud. This word is used for two opposite meanings, that of sleeping and that of waking both. But, the words: وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ at this place, mean be awake with the Qur'an in a part of the night' because the pronoun in: بہٖ (bihi: with it) reverts back to the Qur'an. (Mazhari) 'Being awake with the Qur'an' means the making of Salah (with full compliance of what it requires). This very nightly prayer is called the prayer of Tahajjud in the terminology of Shari'ah. Speaking generally, the sense in which it has been taken is that the prayer said after waking up from a short sleep is the Tahajjud. But, according to Tafsir Mazhari, the sense of the verse is no more than sacrificing sleep to make Salah during some part of the night. This sense holds good for sleeping a little, then waking up from it and making Salah. Very similarly, it is also good if one begins by postponing sleep for Tahajjud and makes the Salah. The condition that one has to sleep before doing the prayer of Tahajjud is not found in the words used by the Qur'an. Apart from this, there are reports from Ahadith which support this general sense of Tahajjud.\nAnd the definition of the prayer of Tahajjud reported from al-Hasan al-Basri (رح) by Imam Ibn Kathir (رح) also confirms this element of generality. The words of the report are as follows:\nقال الحسن البصری (رح) ھو ما کان بعد العشاء و یحمل علٰی ما کان بعد النوم\nAl-Hasan a1-Bari (رح) says: The prayer of Tahajjud holds good for every prayer that is said after al-` Isha And, (because of actual practice) it will be applied to that which is said after some sleep. (Ibn Kathir)\nThe outcome is that being after sleep is no condition in the real sense of the prayer of Tahajjud - and this condition is not present in the words of the Qur'an as well. But, speaking generally, it has been the constant practice of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his noble Companions ؓ that they used to do their Tahajjud prayer after waking up in the later part of the night, therefore, this would be the better way of doing it.\nIs the prayer of Tahajjud Fard (obligatory) or Nafl (additional)?\nThe words: نَفل nafl and نَافِلَةً :nafilah in: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you - 79) literally mean 'additional.' Therefore, prayer (Salah) and charity (sadaqah, khairat) etc. that is not obligatory or necessary and, the doing of which brings thawab (reward), and not doing which entails no sin or misconduct, are called nafl. In this verse, by looking at the words: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you) with the prayer of Tahajjud, it is summarily understood that the prayer of Tahajjud is particularly associated with the Holy Prophet ﷺ as nafl for him. The fact, though, is that its effect as nafl is shared by all, the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his entire ummah. Therefore, some respected early commentators have taken 'nafilah' at this place as an attribute of faridah or duty. The meaning given by them is that the Muslim community at large is obligated with five daily prayers only, but Tahajjud has also been made an additional obligation on the Holy Prophet ﷺ . So, at this place, the word: نَافِلَةً :nafilah appears in the sense of an additional obligation, not in the general sense of nafl.\nLet us look at the correct investigative position in this matter. When, during the early stage of Islam, Surah al-Muzzammil was revealed, that was a time when five prayers had yet to be obligated. What everyone was obligated with was the prayer of Tahajjud. This obligation has been mentioned in Surah al-Muzzammil (73). Then, it was in the night of the Mi` raj (Ascent) that five prayers were made obligatory (fard). So, as for the obligatory nature of Tahajjud, it was abrogated as a duty on the Muslim community at large, by consensus. However, difference did exist about its obligatory nature. Was it also abrogated in the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ? Or, did it remain an obligation on him as a matter of special consideration - and in this verse, the expression: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (nafilatal-lak) means exactly that 'the prayer of Tahajjud is an additional obligation on you.' But, according to Tafsir al-Qurtubi, this is not correct for many reasons. Firstly, there is no justification for taking nafl as fard. If it is supposed to be figurative speech, then, there will be no reality against it. Secondly, in authentic Ahdith, only five fixed prayers have been mentioned as obligatory (fard). At the end of another Hadith, it has been said that the fifty prayers made obligatory initially in the nocturnal journey of the Mi` raj were later reduced in number and set at five. Thus, the number was, though, reduced but the reward promised against these was that of no less than fifty. Then it was said: مَا يُبَدَّلُ الْقَوْلُ لَدَيَّ (The word [ given to My servants ] will not be changed with Me - Qaf, 50:29). It means: When the command was given for fifty, the reward shall be given for no less than fifty, though the number to be actually performed was re-duced.\nThe outcome of these narrative reports is no other but that no Salah - other than the five prayers - is obligatory (fard) on the Muslim ummah at large and on the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself. Then, there is a reason for it too. Had the word: نَافِلَةً nafilah been used here in the sense of an 'additional duty,' then, rather than using the word: لکَ (lak: for you) after it, the word used should have been: علَیک ('alaik: on you) since the latter signifies obligation while the word: لَکَ (lak: for you) is used only for approval and permission.\nSimilarly, this is the position declared to be correct and sound in Tafsir Mazhari which says: When the obligatory status of Tahajjud was abrogated in the case of the Muslim ummah, it stood abrogated in the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as well.\t What remained was nafl for everyone. But, this position raises a question: What is the singularity of the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tin it? That it is nafl for everyone already stands proved. What, then, would be the outcome of saying: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you)? The answer is that, according to clear statements of Ahadith, all kinds of voluntary offerings and nafl ` Ibadat made by the Muslim ummah expiate their sins and serve as complements to whatever shortcomings remain in the performance of their obligatory prayers. But, the Holy Prophet ﷺ is not only that he is infallible (ma` sum) against sins, he is also above from any shortcomings in the observance of the etiquette of Salah. Therefore, as far as he is concerned, nafl ` Ibadat are nothing but additional. These cannot make amends for any shortcomings. Instead, these are simply a source of increased nearness to Allah. (Qurtubi, Mazhari)\nIs the prayer of Tahajjud Nafl or Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah?\nAs for Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah (the emphasized Sunnah), Muslim jurists have a standing rule. Whatever the Holy Prophet ﷺ has done constantly, never leaving it unless under compulsion, is Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah - except that it is proved on the authority of an Islamic legal argument that the particular act was special to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and was not for the Muslim community in general. This rule will obviously re-quire that the prayer of Tahajjud should also be taken as Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah for everyone and not a mere nafl. The reason is that the constancy of the Holy Prophet ﷺ in the matter of this Salah stands proved as an uninterrupted Sunnah. And there is no proof of its being restricted to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Therefore, it should be Sunnah al-Mu` ak-kadah for the Muslim ummah at large as well. This is the position Tafsir Mazhari rates as preferable, weightier and worthier. In proof of this being 'emphasized' (al-mu'akkadah), it has pointed out to the Hadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said about a person who used to say his Tahajjud prayer earlier but left it later: 'the Shaitan has soiled his ear.' Such a drastic admonition and warning does not sound in order against the abandonment of nafl only. This tells us that it is Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah (an emphasized Sunnah).\nAnd as for the respected elders who take the position that Tahajjud is only a nafl, they declared this perseverance and constancy to be the hallmark of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then, what he said as admonition against the abandonment of Tahajjud by the person who used to do it before was not really said against its abandonment by him as such. Instead, it was said against first getting used to it, then abandoning it. The reason is that a person who gets into the habit of doing a certain nafl must continue with it assiduously - and there is a consensus of the Muslim ummah on it. If one leaves it after being in the habit of doing it, he will be blameworthy because leaving it without excuse after the habit is the sign of certain evasion and reluctance. However, there is no blame on the person who is just not in the habit of doing it from the very beginning. Allah knows best.\nThe number of Raka` at in the prayer of Tahajjud\nIn the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as narrated by Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ ، 'the Holy Prophet ﷺ would never say more than eleven raka’ at, in Ramadan or during months other than it.' Out of these eleven, according to the Hanafiyyah, three raka’ at used to be that of witr, the remaining eight being that of Tahajjud.\nAnd in a narration of Sahih Muslim, the following words of Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ have been reported: 'The Holy Prophet ﷺ used to say thirteen raka’ at during the night which includes witr and two raka’ at of the Sunnah of Fajr as well.' (Mazhari) The Sunnah of Fajr has been counted with the nightly prayer because they are performed in almost the same sequence. These reports tell us that the usual habit of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was to offer eight raka’ at in the prayer of Tahajjud.\nBut, from a report coming from Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ herself, it also stands proved that, on occasions, he has done less than that number - four or six - as being sufficient. When Sayyidna Masruq asked her about the prayer of Tahajjud, she has been reported in the Sahih of al-Bukhari to have said: 'There used to be seven, nine and eleven raka’ at - other than the Sunnah of Fajr' (Mazhari from al- Bukhari). According to the Hanafiyyah, if three rakaat are that of witr, four out of seven, six out of nine and eight out of eleven turn out to be the rak’ at of Tahajjud.\nIn what manner was the prayer of Tahajjud offered?\nNarrative reports as they generally appear in Ahadith prove that the first two rak’ at in the beginning were light with a brief recitation. Then, in the rest of the rak’ at, the recitation was long and so were the ruku' and sajdah - and, at times, this length would become too much and, at others, somewhat less. (This is a summary of the Hadith reports taken from Tafsir Mazhari at this place)\nThe Praised Station\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ has been promised مقام محمود (Maqam Mahmud: The Praised Station) in this verse and this station is, out of all prophets, particular to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . As to its explanation, there are different sayings. But, the most sound of them is what appears in authentic Ahadith in the words of the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself. This Station is the station of the Grand Intercession (al-shaf'ah al-kubra). This will come to pass on the plains of Resurrection (al-Hashr) when all children of 'Adam will be there requesting every prophet and Messenger of Allah ﷺ to intercede with Him on their behalf. All prophets (علیہم السلام) will offer their excuse. Only the Holy Prophet ﷺ shall be blessed with the honorable station of interceding on behalf of the entire progeny of 'Adam. Hadith reports carry lengthy relevant details that appear in Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Mazhari at this point.\nThe intercession made by prophets and the righteous will be accepted\nOut of the Islamic sects, the Khawarij and the Mu'tazilah deny the intercession of prophets. They say that a major sin will not be forgiven through intercession by anyone. But, Ahadith coming in uninterrupted succession prove that the intercession for sinners will be accepted from Prophets (علیہم السلام) ، even from the righteous of the community. There will be many whose sins will be forgiven through intercession.\nBased on a report from Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ ، it appears in Ibn Majah and al-Baihaqi that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: On the day of Qiyamah, the blessed prophets will be the first to intercede on behalf of sinners, then the ` Ulama' and then the Shuhada'. According to Dailami reporting from Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that the ` Alim will be told that he could intercede on behalf of his disciples, even if their number matches the number of stars.\nAnd Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban carry a narration of Sayyidna Abu al-Darda' ؓ ، with its chains ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ who said: The intercession made by a Shahid (شَھِید) will be accepted in favour of seventy people from his family.\nThe Musnad of Ahmad, al-Tabarani and al-Baihaqi authentically report Sayyidna Abu Umamah ؓ narrating that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: On the intercession of one person from my ummah many people, more than the entire number of the people of the tribes of Rabi'ah and Mudar, will be admitted to Jannah.\nA question and its answer\nThe question is when the Holy Prophet ﷺ will himself intercede - and no believer will remain in Hell because of it - why and how will the ` Ulama' and the righteous intercede? The answer appears in Tafsir Mazhari: perhaps, the ` Ulama' and the righteous of the community will present their intercession in favour of whomsoever they wish before the Holy Prophet ﷺ who will then intercede with Allah Ta` ala.\nAn important note\nIn a Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: شَفَاعَتِی لِاَھلِ الکَبایٔرِ من اُمَّتِی (My intercession shall be for people who had committed major sins). This seems to tell us that those involved with major sins will be forgiven particularly through the intercession of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Any angel or any individual from the Muslim community will not be able to intercede in the case of those who have committed major sins. Instead of that, the intercession made by the righteous of the Muslim community will be for those who were involved with minor sins.\nThe Station of Intercession could be reached through the efficacy of the prayer of Tahajjud\nHadrat Mujaddid Alf Thani, the famous religious revivalist of the first Islamic millennium in India, said that, in this verse, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was first given the command to make the prayer of Tahajjud, then he was promised the Praised Station, that is, the Station of Grand Intercession. This tells us that the prayer of Tahajjud serves as a special via media in acquiring the Station of Intercession.\nBefore we proceed to verse 8o, let us recapitulate what was said in the verses previous to it. Mentioned there first were the pains inflicted on the Holy Prophet ﷺ and the conspiracies they kept hatching to hurt and harm him. Along with it, it was also said that these hostile plans made by them will never succeed. In contrast, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was being blessed with the real plan to offset their evil by prompting him to establish the five prayers, and the Tahajjud. Following that, he has been promised the Praised Station, the highest among all prophets - a promise to be fulfilled in the Hereafter. Now, in this verse 80: وَقُل رَّ‌بِّ أَدْخِلْنِي (And say, \"0 my Lord, make me enter...), the first relief to him against the hurtful and treacherous actions of the disbelievers was given by Allah Ta` ala within this world in the form of his migration to Madinah. Then, he was given the good news of the conquest of Makkah in: وَقُلْ جَاءَ الْحَقُّ (And say, \"Truth has come...81)."

      "text": "After having mentioned these two events, Allah Ta’ ala declared His Law in such matters by saying: إِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا (If you do this again, We shall do that again - 8). This law which means - if you return to disobedience and contumacy, We shall, once again, make a similar penalty and punishment zoom back upon you' - has been declared as valid right through the last day of Qiyamah. That its addressees were the people of Bani Isra'il who were present during the blessed time of the Holy Prophet ﷺ serves as a reminder to them. It is being pointed out to them that they should not forget that they were seized by divine punishment twice when they had first opposed the code of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) ، and then the code of Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) . Now this was the period of the Code of laws brought by the Holy Prophet ﷺ . This was a period that will continue up to the Last Day. Let them, therefore, realize that the fate of those who chose to be hostile to it will turn out to be no different. Consequently, this was actually happened. These people became hostile to Islam and the religious code of laws brought by the Holy Prophet ﷺ . When they did that, they were expelled and disgraced at the hands of Muslims, and finally Baytul-Maqdis, their Qiblah, too came under Muslim control. However, the only difference was that their past conquering kings had treated them disgracefully and had desecrated their Qiblah too. Now when Muslims took over Baytul-Maqdis, they reconstructed the great Mosque of al-Quds ash-Sharif which was lying demolished and desolate for centuries and thereby reinstated the honor and reverence of the Qiblah of prophets.\nThe events of Bani Isra'il are a lesson for Muslims and what has happened to Baytul-Maqdis in our time is a part of the same chain\nObviously, the purpose of narrating these events relating to the Bani Isra'il in the Qur'an and making Muslims listen to them is to let Muslims understand that they are no exceptions to this divine law. Be it this mortal world or the eternal universe of their Faith, their honor and ascendancy, possessions and wealth are inseparably tied with obedience to Allah. Whenever they veer away from their obedience to Allah and the Holy Prophet ﷺ their enemies and disbelieving tyrants of all sorts shall be empowered to prevail over them. When this happens, the desecration of their places of worship will also not remain too far.\nThe calamity of the Jewish usurpation of Baytul-Maqdis in our time and the added sacrilege of setting fire to it has thrown the world of Islam into acute anxiety. In reality, it is confirming the Qur'an. Muslims forgot Allah and His Rasul ﷺ ، ignored the life waiting for them in the Hereafter and opted to scrounge for their share in the glamour and grandeur of the mortal world. When they became aliens to the dictates of the Qur’ an, and Sunnah, the same divine law stood activated before them. A few hundred thousand Jews overcame them. They also inflicted the loss of life and property on them. Worse still is the fate of one of the three greatest mosques of the world according to the religious law of Islam, a mosque that has the distinction of being the Qiblah of all prophets. It was snatched from them and those who took it over had a track record of being the most disgraced people in this world, that is, the Jews. In addition to that, it is common observation that these people stand nowhere close to Muslims in terms of their numbers, nor do they have some signif-icant superiority over the current collective Muslim holdings of war materials. This also tells us that this event does not really give Jews any niche of honour in the annals of world nations. However, it does provide punishment for Muslims in return for their disobedience. It clearly shows that everything that came to pass came as the punishment of our own misdeeds. And it also shows that there is no remedy for it except that we should feel ashamed of our misdeeds, make a genuine taubah (repentance), start obeying the commandments of Allah, become true Muslims and shun the great sins of imitating and trusting others. If we were to do just that, insha'Allah, true to the Divine promise, Baytul-Maqdis and Palestine shall return to us. But, it is regrettable that the present-day Arab rulers and common Muslims living in Arab lands have yet to be alerted to that reality. They are still relying on foreign assistance while making plans of taking Baytul-Maqdis back, something that does not appear to be probable, at least outwardly. Where else shall we lodge our plaint but Allah!\nThe only weapon system and military hardware with which Baytul-Maqdis and Palestine can return to Muslim hands are still there waiting to be picked up - Return to Allah, genuinely and passionately. Have certitude of Akhirah. Obey the injunctions of the Shari'ah. Stay away from imitating and trusting others in our social and political goals. Finally, let us place our trust in Allah and wage a purely Islamic Jihad as enjoined by the Shari'ah. May Allah Ta` ala give our Arab rulers and other Muslims the ability to answer the challenge effectively.\nA strange coincidence\nAllah Ta` ala has made two places on this Earth to serve as the Qiblah or orientation for those who worship Him, the Baytul-Maqdis and the Baytullah. But, the divine law relating to each of them is different. That Baytullah shall be protected and that disbelievers shall never take it over is a security concern that Allah Ta’ ala has taken it upon Himself. The Event of the Elephant mentioned in Surah al-Fil (105) of the Holy Qur'an came as its result. When the Christian king of Yaman (Abrahah al-Ashram) invaded Baytullah, Allah Ta’ ala destroyed him and his army along with the contingent of elephants he had brought, through birds, much before he could reach Baytullah.\nBut, this law does not apply in the case of Baytul-Maqdis. Instead, as the verses cited above tell us, when Muslims go astray and start indulging in disobedience and sin, this Qiblah will be snatched away from them and it will pass into the control of disbelievers.\nDisbelievers too are the servants of Allah, but not among the accepted ones\nAbout the first event (5), the Holy Qur’ an said: When the people of Faith start letting them be seduced to discord, sin, disobedience and disorder, Allah Ta’ ala shall set upon them such servants of His as would break into their homes killing and plundering. At this place, the Qur’ an has used the expression: عِباداً لَّنَا (` ibadal-lana: Some servants belonging to Us) and not: عِبَادَنَا (` ibadana: Our servants) - even though it was brief. There is wisdom behind it. Is it not that the attribution of a servant to Allah is, for him, the greatest conceivable honor? This is similar to what we have explained at the beginning of this very Surah under our comments on the first verse: أَسْرَ‌ىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ (asra' bi` abdihi: made His servant travel at night). There it was said that certainly great was the honour and nearness the Holy Prophet ﷺ was blessed with during the night of the Mi` raj. But, when the Qur'an describes this event, it does not mention either his blessed name or some attribute. It simply said: عَبْدِهِ (abdihi: His servant). This tells us that the ultimate perfection a human person can have, and the highest station he can occupy, is that Allah Ta’ ala chooses to cherish a servant by calling him 'His' servant. In the verse under reference, the people who meted out the punishment to the Bani Isra'il were kafirs, or disbelievers after all. Therefore, instead of calling them: عِبَادِنَا (Our servants), Allah Ta’ ala has broken the element of attribution and connection and said: عِبَاداًلَّنا (some servants belonging to Us). Thus, a hint has been given here that all human beings are nothing but servants of Allah as created, but because of the absence of 'Iman or faith, they are not the kind of accepted servants who could be attributed directly to Allah Ta` ala."

      "text": "It has been reported in al-Jami` of Tirmidhi from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was in Makkah al-Mu` azzamah. Then, he was commanded to migrate to Madinah. Thereupon, this verse was revealed: وَقُل رَّ‌بِّ أَدْخِلْنِي مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ وَأَخْرِ‌جْنِي مُخْرَ‌جَ صِدْقٍ (And say, \"0 my Lord, make me enter a rightful entrance and make me exit a rightful exit - so). Here, the word: مُدخَل (mudkhal) and\tمُخرَج (mukhraj) meaning the place of entry and the place of exit are اِسمَ ظرف (ism-al-zarf: the noun of place and time). The addition of the attribute (na't) of صِدق :sidq (translated as rightful) releases the sense of such entry and exit being totally true to the will and pleasure of Allah and in the best of attending circumstances, because the word: صِدق to (sidq) is also used in the Arabic language for every such act as is correct and better both outwardly and inwardly. The words: قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ (Yunus 10:2), لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ (ash-Shu` ara 26:84) and مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ (al-Qamar 54:55) have been used in the Holy Qur'an in that very sense.\n'Entrance' means 'Madinah' and the place of exit denotes 'Makkah.' The sense takes the form of a prayer: 0 Allah, may my entry into Madinah turn out to be good and smooth, without having to face anything unpleasant and unwelcome on arrival there. And may my exit from Makkah be good and smooth, without being entangled in love of country and home.' There are other exegetic statements too which explain this verse. But, this particular explanation has been reported from Hasan al-Basri (رح) and Qatadah. Ibn Kathir calls it 'the most sound statement.' Ibn Jarir too has gone by it. As for the order, it required that the 'exit' should have been mentioned first while the 'entrance,' later. But, the precedence of 'entrance' and the succession of 'exit' is there, perhaps, to indicate that the exit from Makkah had no purpose of its own, in fact, parting from the Baytullah was extremely shocking. But, there was a purpose - to look for peace, for Islam and Muslims - something that could be hoped for through the entry in Madinah. Therefore, the objective to be achieved was made to come first.\nA prayer for important objectives\nAt the time of his migration to Madinah, Allah Ta’ ala asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ to make this dua' which pleaded with Him that his exit from Makkah and then the arrival in Madinah should both be good and smooth in all possible ways. It was the outcome of this prayer that, though he was within the striking range of the pursuing disbelievers at the time of Hijrah, yet Allah Ta’ ala shielded him at every step and finally made Madinah al-Tayyibah good and promising for him and for all Muslims, both outwardly and inwardly. Therefore, some ` Ulama' have said that every Muslim should remember to make this prayer at the beginning of all objectives they wish to pursue and that this prayer is beneficial for all objectives and purposes. The sentence which complements this very prayer appears next: وَاجْعَل لِّي مِن لَّدُنكَ سُلْطَانًا نَّصِيرً‌ا \"and grant me from Your Own a power favoured (by You).\" Qatadah, the great tabi` i says: the Holy Prophet ﷺ knew that fulfilling his functional duties as a prophet and working while besieged by enemies were challenges he could not handle personally. Therefore, He prayed to Allah Ta’ ala for help and the power to subdue. The prayer was answered and everyone saw its effects."

      "text": "Verse 81: وَقُلْ جَاءَ الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَاطِلُ (And say, \"Truth has come and false-hood has vanished\" ) was revealed after Hijrah about the conquest of Makkah. Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ says that on the day Makkah was conquered, the Holy Prophet ﷺ entered Makkah. At that time, there were three hundred and sixty idols standing around the Baytullah. Some ` Ulama' report a reason for this particular number. They say that the Mushriks of Makkah had a separate idol for each day of the year that they used to worship on the given day. (Qurtubi) When the Holy Prophet ﷺ reached there, this was the verse he had on his blessed lips: وَقُلْ جَاءَ الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَاطِلُ (Truth has come and falsehood has vanished) while he went round striking at each single idol on the chest with his stick. (al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nIt appears in some Hadith narratives that the end of this stick had a pewter or iron ferrule mounted on it. So, when the Holy Prophet ﷺ would hit an idol on the chest, it would fall back. In the end, when all idols fell down, he gave orders that they be demolished. (Qurtubiwithreference to Qadi ` Iyad and al-Qushairi)\nIt is necessary to erase customs and symbols of polytheism, disbelief and falsehood\nImam al-Qurtubi said that this verse proves that it is wajib (necessary, obligatory) to erase the idols of Mushriks and all other polytheistic symbols and signs - and all such false instruments that are used in the way of sin and disobedience as well. They too come under the purview of the game injunction. Ibn al-Mundhir said that pictures and sculpted figures made in wood or metal etc. also come under the injunction governing idols. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had torn the curtain having pictures made on it in lines and colors. This, incidentally, tells us about the general injunctions covering common pictures. According to Sahih Hadith, when Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) will come towards the later times, he will undo the cross and eliminate the swine. These things prove that it is necessary to demolish and eliminate the instruments of shirk, kufr and batil."

      "text": "Commentary\nRegarding the explanation of the word: شاکِلَۃ (shakilah) in verse 84: كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَىٰ شَاكِلَتِهِ (Everyone acts in his own style), several interpretations have been reported from authorities among the early righteous elders,\nsuch as, disposition, habit, instinct, intention, way or manner. In sum, all these turn into a second nature in terms of the circumstances, habits and customs everyone lives with. Thus, what one does remains subservient to it. (Qurtubi) In this verse, human beings have been warned that they must abstain from bad surroundings, bad company and bad habits and take to the company of good people and inculcate good habits (a1-Jassas). The reason, as stated earlier, is that one's response pattern built up under the influence of surrounding, company and custom makes one do what it dictates. Imam al-Jassas has also given another meaning of 'shakilah' at this place, that of 'like.' Given this meaning, the sense of the verse would be that everyone feels comfortable with a person who is compatible with one's temperament. A good man finds another good man familiar while a wicked man feels comfortable with another wicked man whose style he follows without any qualms of conscience. An example of this behavior pattern appears in what Allah says in the Qur’ an: الْخَبِيثَاتُ لِلْخَبِيثِينَ (Evil women are for evil men - 24:26) and وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ لِلطَّيِّبِينَ (Good women are for good men - 24:26). It means that everyone strikes familiarity with a man or woman according to one's own temperament. In short, this too is a warning against falling into bad company and bad habits. One should really make an effort to abstain from these."

      "ayah": 85,
      "surah": 17,
      "text": "Commentary\nThe first verse (85) appearing above carries a question posed by disbelievers about Ruh (soul, spirit) along with its answer that came from Allah Ta` ala. The word: اَلرُّوح (al-ruh) is used in the Arabic language and idiom, and in the Holy Qur'an as well, to convey several meanings. The well-recognized meaning taken from this word is common knowledge, that is, the soul on which depends life. In the Holy Qur'an, this word has also been used for the archangel, Jibra'il al-Amin (علیہ السلام) (Gabriel, the Trust-worthy): \" نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّ‌وحُ الْأَمِينُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ \" (The Trustworthy Spirit has brought it down upon your heart - ash-Shu` ra' 26:193, 194). It has also been used for Sayyidna ` Isa \tعلیہ السلام (4:171), and Wahy (revelation - 40:15), and the Qur'an too: أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُ‌وحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِ‌نَا (and We have revealed to you a spirit of Our command - 42:52).\nWhat does 'Ruh' signify?\nTherefore, the first thing to be determined here is the intent of the questioners as to which meaning they had in mind when they had asked the question about the Ruh. Some respected early commentators have, in view of the context, declared this question as related to revelation and Qur'an, or to angel Jibra'il who brought it. The apparent reason is that the Qur'an was mentioned earlier in: وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْ‌آنِ (And We reveal the Qur'an - 82) and it is again the Qur'an that finds mention in the verses after that. Given this congruity, they found it appropriate to take 'Ruh' in this question too as signifying nothing but Wahy and Qur'an, or Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) . In that case, the question would be about how the Wahy or revelation came to him and who brought it. In response to the question, the Holy Qur’ an considered it sufficient to say that the revelation was from the command of Allah. It elected to be silent about its details and modalities that the questioners were seeking.\nBut, the background of the revelation of this verse given in authentic Ahadith ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ is just about very clear in respect of the nature of the question. Those asking the question had asked about the living Ruh and the underlying purpose was to find out the reality of Ruh. What is it? How does it come in and go out of the human body? How does it make man and animal come alive? According to the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ narrates:\n'Once I was walking with the Holy Prophet ﷺ through an unpopulated part of Madinah. He had a stick from the branch of a date palm in his blessed hand. When he passed by some Jews, they were talking among themselves: Muhammad is coming. Ask him about the Ruh. Others asked them not to do that. But, those bent on asking went ahead and asked the question. After having heard the question, the Holy Prophet ﷺ reclined on his stick and stood silent which gave me the inkling that the revelation was about to come on him. After a little while, when the revelation had come to him, he recited the verse: وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّ‌وحِ (And they ask you about the Ruh).'\nAt this point, it is understandable that it was a terminology of the Qur'an when it called the Qur’ an, or Wahy (revelation) as Ruh. That the question asked by these people was based on it is too far out. Of course, the matter of the living Ruh, human or animal, is such as would naturally emerge in everyone's mind. Therefore, the majority of commentators - Ibn Kathir, Ibn Jarir, al-Qurtubi, Abu Hayyan, 'Alusi - confirm the view that the question related to the reality of the living Ruh. As for the continuity of references to the Qur'an in the context and that the question-answer interlude about Ruh coming in between would be incoherent, its answer is clear. Previous verses have mentioned hostile questions asked by the disbelievers and Mushriks. Their objective thereby was to test the Holy Prophet ﷺ concerning his claim to be a messenger of Allah. This question too is a link of the same chain. Therefore, it is not incoherent. There is yet another authentic Hadith reported about the background of the revelation of this verse particularly. The position being explained here has been covered there more explicitly, that is, the purpose of the questioner was to test the authority of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as a Messenger.\nAccordingly, a report of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ appearing in the Musnad of Abmad says that the Quraysh of Makkah who kept addressing all sorts of questions to the Holy Prophet ﷺ hit upon the idea that the Jews were learned and knew about past scriptures. Why not ask them about what to ask the Holy Prophet ﷺ and test him thereby? Therefore, they sent their men to the Jews seeking their guidance in this matter. They told them to ask about the Ruh. (Ibn Kathir)\nSayyidn Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has also been reported to have said in his explanation of this verse that the Jews had also said while asking this question - 'you tell us how does punishment affect the Ruh.' By that time, nothing had been revealed to the Holy Prophet ﷺ about it. Therefore, he did not answer the question instantly at that time. Then, came angel Jibra'il with the verse: قُلِ الرُّ‌وحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ‌ رَ‌بِّي (Say, \"the Ruh is from the command of my Lord.\" ) (Abridged from Ibn Kathir)\nThe incident of the question: Did it happen in Makkah or Madinah?\nBefore we resolve this aspect of the question, we have to consider the two Hadith reports relating to the background of the revelation of this verse, that of Sayyidna Ibn Mas’ ud and Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، referred to above. Out of the two, according to the report of Sayyidna Ibn Mas’ ud ؓ ، this incident about the question came to pass in Madinah - and that is the reason why some commentators have declared this verse to be Madani, though a major portion of Surah Bani Isra'il (al-Isra' ) is Makki. As for the report from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، it places the incident at Makkah. In accordance with that, this verse too remains Makki like the whole Surah. Therefore, Ibn Kathir has declared this very probability to be weightier and more acceptable. And as for the report of Sayyidna Ibn Mas’ ud ؓ ، he responds by saying that it is possible that this verse was revealed in Madinah a second time - as a repeated revelation of many verses of the Qur'an is an accepted fact in the sight of all ` Ulama'. And Tafsir Mazhari, by declaring the report of Sayyidna Ibn Mas’ ud ؓ as weightier and more acceptable, has determined the incident to be that of Madinah and the verse to be Madani. It gives two reasons for it. Firstly, this report appears in the two Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim and its authority is stronger as compared to the report of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ . Secondly, in this report, Sayyidna Ibn Mas’ ud ؓ is a part of the incident. He is narrating an event that was his own. This makes it contrary to the report of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ where, it is obvious, he would have heard it as told by someone (because he was too young at that time to witness the occurrence).\nThe answer to the question asked\nThe Holy Qur'an said: قُلِ الرُّ‌وحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ‌ رَ‌بِّي (Say, \"the Ruh is from the command of my Lord.\" ). While explaining the answer, statements and interpretations given by commentators differ. The closest and the clearest of these is what Qadi Thana'ullah Panipati has preferred in his Tafsir Mahari. He says: Only what was necessary and what common people would understand has been told - and the full reality of Ruh, that the question sought, was not unfolded because it was beyond the comprehension of common people and, for that matter, nothing they needed hinged on understanding it. Here, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was asked to respond by saying that 'the Ruh is from the command of my Lord.' In other words, it is not like the usual created that come into existence through the dispersal of matter and procreation. In fact, it is something created directly through the command (کُن kun: be) of Allah Ta’ ala. At least, this much of the answer makes it clear that Ruh cannot be taken on the analogy of common matter - which removes all those doubts that emerge as a result of trying to understand Ruh through the prism of materialistic inquiry. The hard truth is that this much knowledge of Ruh is sufficient for man. No business, religious or worldly, depends on knowing more than that. Therefore, taking that part of the question as redundant and unnecessary, it was not answered - specially when understanding its reality is something not easy even for the wisest of the wise, not to say much about the common people.\nAnswering every question is not necessary unless religiously advisable\nImam Abu Bakr al-Jassas (رح) has deduced from this answer the ruling that it is not necessary for the Mufti and ` Alim to answer every question and every aspect from it as posed by the questioner. Instead of doing that, the answer should be given with religious advisability kept in sight. Any answer that is above the comprehension of the addressee, or should there be the danger of his or her falling into misunderstanding, then, such an answer should not be given. Similarly, not to be answered are questions that are unnecessary (لَا یَعنِی :la ya` ni). Yes, should there be a person who faces a situation in which he must act one way or the other and who is no ` Alim, then, it is necessary for the Mufti and ` Alim to give an answer in the light of his knowledge. (Jassas) Imam al-Bukhari has devoted a chapter heading in Kitab al-` Ilm to highlight this point. He has said that a question the answer to which is likely to cause misunderstanding should not be answered.\nWhether or not it is possible for anyone to have the knowledge of the reality of Ruh\nThe Holy Qur'an has given an answer to this question in accordance with the need and comprehension of the addressee. It has not elected to unfold the reality of Ruh. But, it does not necessarily imply that no human being can simply understand the reality of Ruh and that the Holy Prophet ﷺ also did not know its reality. The truth of the matter is that this verse neither negates nor confirms it. If a prophet or messenger were to come to know its reality through Wahy (revelation), or a Waliyy (man of Allah) through Kashf (illumination) and Ilham (inspiration), then, it is not contrary to this verse. In fact, even if this matter is debated and investigated in terms of reason and philosophy, it would certainly be called useless and unnecessary, but it cannot be called impermissible. Therefore, many learned scholars from the early and later period of Islam have written standard books about Ruh. In our period, my venerated teacher, Shaykh al-Islam, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani has presented this issue admirably in a small tract. Here, he has explained its reality to the measure it is possible for a common person to understand and an educated one to find sufficient enough to avoid doubts and difficulties.\nAn important note\nAt this juncture, Imam al-Baghawi has carried a detail report from Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ as follows: This verse was revealed in Makkah al-Mukarramah. It happened at a time when the Quraysh chiefs of Makkah got together and talked about the problem that Muhammad ﷺ was born amongst us and grew up into a young man. No one ever doubted his trustworthiness, honesty and truthfulness, and he was never accused by anyone of having told a lie. Yet, despite all that, we just do not understand the claim of being a prophet he was now making. Therefore, let us do something about it, like sending our delegation to the Jewish scholars of Madinah and get a learned opinion about him from them. So, a delegation from the Quraysh met the Jewish scholars in Madinah. They advised: we tell you three things. Ask him about these three. If he answers all three, he is no prophet. Similarly, if he does not answer any of the three, he is still no prophet. And if he answers two, not answering the third, be certain that he is the prophet. They proposed three questions: (1) Ask him about those in the past who had sought refuge in a cave to stay safe from shirk - because, their account is unique. (2) Ask him about the person who had traveled through the East and West of the Earth and what had happened to him. (3) Ask him about the Ruh (soul, spirit).\n. This detail is in accordance with Ma` alim al-Tanzil, p. 134, v. 4 - Muhammad Taqi Usmani.\nThe delegation returned and posed those three questions before the Holy Prophet ﷺ . He said, 'I shall give you the answer to these tomorrow'- but, he did not say, \"Insha'Allah\" with it. The outcome was that the channel of Wahy (revelation) remained discontinued for a few days. There are various reports that put the number of days from twelve, fifteen to forty during which it stood stopped. The Quraysh of Makkah had their opportunity to hurl taunts - 'we were promised an answer tomorrow, now so many days have passed and we have no answer!' This caused the Holy Prophet ﷺ\ttoo to become anxious. Then came angel Jibra'il with the verse: وَلَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَيْءٍ إِنِّي فَاعِلٌ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا إِلَّا أَن يَشَاءَ اللَّـهُ (And never say about anything: \"I will do that tomorrow,\" without [ saying ]: \"Insha'Allah\": [ If Allah wills ].' - al-Kahf, 18: 23, 24) and, after that, he recited the verse about the Ruh mentioned above. Then came the revelation of the verses relating to the people of Kahf, and the event of Dhul-Qarnain who had traveled from the East to the West which is to appear in Surah al-Kahf. A detailed answer has been given there by narrating the story of the people of Kahf and Dhul-Qarnain while the question concerned with the reality of the Ruh was not answered (which made the sign of the veracity of prophecy given by the Jews manifest). Tirmidhi has also described this event briefly. (Mazhari)\nInvestigative observations on the reality of Ruh (soul, spirit) and Nafs (self) have appeared earlier in this volume under verse 29 of Sarah al-Hijr: نَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّ‌وحِي (I have blown into him of my spirit - 15:29). Presented with reference to Tafsir Mazhari, it makes the kinds of Ruh along with the reality of each sufficiently clear."

Therefore, getting entangled with unnecessary debates and investigations is a waste of precious time.

      "text": "The subject in verse 88: قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الْإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ (If all humans and jinns join together...) appears in some other verses of the Holy Qur'an as well. Challenging the humankind, it has been said there: If you do not take the Qur'an to be the word of Allah, rather take it to be a word of man, then, you too are human, why would you not come up with its like? Along with that challenge, it was also said in this verse: Not the human-kind alone, you are welcome to join up with jinns, but you, all combined together, will still be unable to come out with one Surah - even one verse - like that of the Qur'an.\nThe repetition of this subject at this place may possibly be to show the futility of what the deniers of the message were trying to do. Here they were trying to test the veracity of the mission of a prophet of Allah by asking all sorts of questions, the one about the Ruh being one of them. Being an exercise in futility, why would they go about digging into unnecessary issues only to determine whether or not the prophet sent to them was true? Why they would not look into the Qur’ an as it is? It leaves no room for doubt in the veracity of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as Prophet and Messenger of Allah ﷺ . The reason is simple. When the humans and jinns of the whole world are incapable of producing the least like of it, what doubt could there be in that it is but the Divine Word. And once it is proved so manifestly that the Holy Qur'an is Divine Word, hardly any doubt remains in that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was a true prophet and messenger of Allah ﷺ ."

The present verses cite the miracle of Qur'an as its confirmation.\nCommentary\nThe most upright way\nThe way to which the Qur'an guides has been called 'aqwam,' the most upright. 'Aqwam' can be explained by saying that it is a way that is closer to the destination, is easy and free of dangers at the same time. (Qurtubi) This tells us that the rules set for human life by the Holy Qur'an are a combination of all three features mentioned above. However, it is a different matter that man may start taking this way to be difficult or dangerous on occasions because of his own lack of comprehension. But, the Lord of all the worlds has the most comprehensive knowledge of every single particle in the entire universe. Before Him, the past and the future are the same. It is He who can have the knowledge of the reality as to the function and form most beneficial for human beings. And since man is unaware of things as they are in a comprehensive setting, he can-not identify even his own good or bad fully and decisively."

      "text": "Only a human being can be a messenger of Allah: Angels cannot be sent as messengers to human beings\nCommon disbelievers and polytheists thought that 'bashar,' that is, a man, could not be the messenger of Allah because he is someone accustomed to all human compulsions like them. When so, what edge did he have over them to make them call him the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and take him as their leader claiming that they follow him? This assumption of theirs has been answered in the Holy Qur'an, at several places in various ways. The outcome of the answer given here in this verse: مَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ (And nothing prevented people - 94) is that a messenger of Allah sent to a set of people has to be from their genus or race. If these people are human, the messenger should be human because mutual congruity does not exist between one genus and the other - and without congruity, guidance and grooming bring no benefit. Had some angel been sent to men as their messenger, he would have known no hunger, or thirst, or sexual de-sires, nor would he have felt the effect of chill and heat, nor fatigue after hard work. He would have, then, expected human beings to act like him without having ever realized their weaknesses and limitations. Similarly, when human beings knew that he was an angel, after all, they would have come to the conclusion that they just did not have the ability to do what he did. Who would have, then, followed him? Following is the fruit of correction, reform and right guidance. This benefit can be hoped for only when the messenger of Allah is from the genus of men. He should be an embodiment of human emotions and physical desires while, at the same time, he should also have an angelic majesty that could serve as a liaison - intermediary communicator - between human beings and angels, receiving revelation from angels bringing it and communicating it to his fellow human beings.\nThis submission also removes the doubt that arises by thinking: when human beings cannot derive benefit from the angel, how would a messenger - despite being human - derive the benefit of revelation from them?\nAs for the doubt - when the compatibility of genus is a condition between a messenger and his people, how was the Holy Prophet ﷺ made a messenger of the jinns for they are not from the same genus as men? - it can be answered by saying that the messenger is not simply a human being, instead, he also has an angelic majesty about him because of which jinns too could also be congruous to him."
