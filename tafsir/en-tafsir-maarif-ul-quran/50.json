      "text": "Consoling the Holy Prophet ﷺ\nكَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَأَصْحَابُ الرَّ‌سِّ وَثَمُودُ (It [ resurrection ] was rejected prior to them by the people of Nuh, and the people of Rass - 50:12). It was mentioned in the preceding verses that the infidels rejected the Prophethood of Sayyidna Muhammad ﷺ and the Hereafter. This obviously perturbed and upset him. In this verse Allah comforts him by narrating the stories of the previous prophets and their communities. Every community in the past persecuted their respective prophets. This was the behavior pattern of all disbelieving nations against their prophets throughout history. Thus the Holy Prophet ﷺ is consoled that he should not be disheartened by this behavior. The story of the people of Nuh (علیہ السلام) is repeated several times in the Qur'an in that the Holy Prophet Nuh (علیہ السلام) preached to his people for 950 years but in response they not only rejected him but also subjected him to various hardships.\nWho are people of Rass?\nLexically, the word rass in Arabic has several meanings. Most prominently it refers to a well that has not been built by bricks or stones. People of Rass were the remnants of Thamud who had remained alive after the punishment. Dahhak ؓ and other commentators narrate their story that follows. When the people of Salih (علیہ السلام) were destroyed by Allah's punishment, a remnant [ about 4000] of them escaped it, because they had reposed faith in him and obeyed him. They left their original place and took shelter in Hadramaut (a city in Yemen). Holy Prophet Salih (علیہ السلام) was with them. They went to a well and stayed there. Salih passed away here; therefore this place is called Hadara Maut [ death overcame ] and the people settled there permanently.\nLater their descendants took to idol-worship, to whom a prophet was sent to preach and reform, but they killed him. The community was annihilated by Divine punishment. Their well, on which their lives depended, was rendered useless; and their buildings and dwellings were desolated. The Qur'an has described it in the following words, فَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُ‌وشِهَا وَبِئْرٍ‌ \t\"So, there they are, fallen down on heir roofs, and Chow many a deserted well ane well-built castle!\" (22:45). For discerning eyes the abandoned well and desolate lofty palaces are sufficient to judge and decide on the consequences of one's deeds.\nThamud\nThese are the people of the Prophet Salih (علیہ السلام) whose story has been repeated several times in the Qur'an."

      "text": "Linkage\nThe preceding verses purported to quell the doubt of those who denied the possibility of Resurrection and who thought that raising the dead was inconceivable. As a result, the unbelievers drew a false analogy between their finite knowledge and power and the infinite knowledge and power of Allah. Therefore, the perplexity arose in their mind: 'after we die, disintegrate, with our organs torn apart, our bodies reduced to particles of dust and scattered or spread all over the world, how is it possible to gather them together and recompose them back into our original shape and bodies?\nThe preceding verses responded that the Divine knowledge is all-encompassing and He knows every single particle of the universe, and therefore it is not difficult for Him to recollect these particles. The same subject has been further elaborated in the present verses by declaring that Allah not only has the complete knowledge of man's scattered particles, but He also has the full knowledge of all thoughts that cross the mind of man. The verse explains the reason for that: Allah is nearer to him than his jugular vein, on which is dependent his very life. Therefore, He knows man's conditions and circumstances more than man himself.\nAllah is Nearer to Man than his Jugular Vein: An Analysis\nThe concluding part of verse [ 16] says: نَحْنُ أَقْرَ‌بُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِ‌يدِ (We are closer to him than [ his ] jugular vein). The 'closeness' in the verse, by consensus of scholars, refers to \"nearness in terms of all-encompassing knowledge\" not in terms of physical closeness. In this manner, the verse means that Allah's power and knowledge has so encompassed man from within and without that His power and knowledge is nearer to him than his own jugular vein.\nThe term warid [ pl. awridah ] in the Arabic language are animal veins which supply blood to the entire body. Medically, there are two types of veins: [ 1] the veins that emerge from the liver and supply pure blood to the entire human body. Medically, only these veins are referred to as warid [ awridah ]; and [ 2] the veins that emerge from animal heart and supply the subtle vapor of blood to the entire human body which in medical terminology is referred to as ruh [ soul ]. These veins are called in Arabic shiryan [ which actually refers to an artery ]. The first type of veins is thick-walled and the second type is thin-walled.\nThe word warid in the above verse does not necessarily apply to the vein that comes from the liver in the medical sense. In fact it could well apply, in the literal sense, to the vein that comes from the heart because in that too a type of blood circulates. As the purport of this verse is to show that Allah possesses full knowledge of all thoughts that cross the mind of man, the literal sense of the term seems more appropriate. Nevertheless, whether the word warid is taken medically in the sense of a vein coming from the liver or in the sense of an artery coming from the heart is immaterial. In both cases the living creatures' life depends on it.\nIf the veins or arteries are cut, they lose their soul and die. In short, Allah encompasses complete and full knowledge about everything of man, because He is closer to him than his neck-vein.\nAccording to the Honourable Sufis, here the term qurb (closeness) goes beyond the concept of nearness in terms of knowledge. It is a special type of ittisal [ contact or bond or relationship between Allah and His creation, including man who is placed at the centre of the wonderful universe ], the reality and nature of which is not known to anyone, but it does necessarily exist bila kaif \"without how\" or indescribably. Various Qur'anic verses and authentic Prophetic Traditions bear ample testimony to this fact. For example, the Qur'an commands: وَاسْجُدْ وَاقْتَرِ‌ب ۩ ﴿19﴾ (and bow down in sajdah, and come closer....A1-Alaq: 18) This is just like what the Holy Prophet ﷺ is reported to have said: \"The closest that a servant can be to his Lord is when he is in prostration. Therefore, make abundant supplications (i.e. while prostrating).\" Another Tradition reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tsaid: \"When My servant performs supererogatory prayers, he attains proximity to Me.\" On the occasion of migration to Madinah, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said to Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ إِنَّ اللَّـهَ مَعَنَا \"Allah is with us. (9:40) \" Holy Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) said to the children of Israel: \"إِنَّ مَعِيَ رَ‌بِّي \"My Lord is with me.\" (26:62)\nThis qurb [ nearness or proximity to Allah ], which man attains through nearness of obligatory and supererogatory works and through his efforts, is reserved exclusively for a believer. Such believers are called awliya'ullah [ the friends of Allah: they are those whom Allah has chosen as His friends ]. This special bond with Allah is different from the general relationship between Allah and man, whether believer or non-believer. In brief, the above verses and narrations bear testimony to the fact that man has a special type of proximity to his Creator and Master though its reality and nature cannot be perceived. Maulana Rumi (رح) has versified this concept thus:\nاتصالے بےمثال و بےقیاس ہست ربّ النَّاس را با جانِ ناس\nThe Lord of the people has a special contact with the people which is beyond one's perception and has no other example.\nThis nearness and proximity cannot be perceived by the ordinary sensation of physical sight, but it is attained through farasah of 'iman [ perspicacity through faith ]. Tafsir Mazhari interprets qurb and ittisal in this verse in the same sense. We have learnt earlier the interpretation of the majority of the commentators that it is not physical proximity, but rather the all-encompassing, full and complete knowledge of Allah. Apart from these two interpretations, Ibn-Kathir interprets it in a third way. He says that the pronoun \"We\" does not refer to the \"Being\" of Allah, but to His angels who are all the time with man. They know man's soul so closely that man himself is not so well aware of it. Allah knows best!"

      "text": "The Two Recording Angels with every Man\nإِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ (when the two receiving angels receive (every human act to record it - 50:17) In the phrase idh yatalaqq al-mutalaqqiyani, (when the two receiving angels receive) the verb yatalaqqa is aorist from the infinitive talaqqi which denotes to take, to accept, to receive, to learn as in the verse فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِن رَّ‌بِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ \" Thereafter 'Adam received a few words from his Lord (2:37) \". The word mutalaqqiyani in the verse is the dual of al-mutalaqqi and refers to the two angels that accompany every human being all the time to receive and record the deeds of mankind. The phrase عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ (seated [ one ] on the right and [ one ] on the left. 50:17) means that the angel sitting on the right records one's good actions, and that on the left, his bad actions. The word qa` id is used in the sense of qa` id, like jalis in the sense of jalis - both meaning \"sitting\". The word qa` id is used for singular as well as plural. However, there is a difference in the usage of qa` id and jalis as opposed to qa` id and jalis in that the former means a person who is actually sitting. But qa` id and jalis are used in the general sense of the words, that is, he who accompanies someone whether sitting, standing or moving around. The word qa` id is used in the verse to describe the two angels, because they accompany human beings all the time and in every state - whether sitting or standing, whether moving or sleeping. The angels move out only when the humans undress their private parts for purposes of responding to the call of nature or having sexual intercourse. However, Allah has equipped them with a special innate sensing device, so that they realize the sins, or become aware of the sins that are being committed in their absence. Ibn Kathir states that, according to the narration of Ahnaf Ibn Qais, the angel sitting on the right records the good deeds, and he is also the supervisor over the angel on the left. If a person commits a sin, the angel on the right says to the one on the left, \"Do not write it yet; give him a chance; maybe he will repent; if he does, then let it go; otherwise record it in your record of deeds\". (Ibn-Abi Haim transmitted it)\nExplanation of Hasan Basri (رح)\nHasan Bari (رح) recited the above verse containing the phrase عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ (seated one on the right, and one on the left) and said:\n\"0 son of 'Adam! Your record of deeds has been spread, and two honorable angels have been appointed. One on your right side and the other on your left. The one on your right side records your good deeds, and the one on your left records your evil deeds and sins. Focus on this reality, and do what you desire, increase it or decrease it. When you die, your record of deeds will be folded, and put around your neck. It will go with you in the grave, and remain there. When you will rise from your grave on the Day of Judgment, Allah will say:\nوَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَ‌هُ فِي عُنُقِهِ ۖ وَنُخْرِ‌جُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورً‌ا ﴿13﴾ اقْرَ‌أْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَىٰ بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ﴿14﴾\n\"And every human's (deeds determining his) fate We have tied up to his neck, and We shall bring forth for him, on the day of Resurrection, a book he will receive wide open. [ 13] \"Read your book. This day you yourself are enough to take your own account.\" [ 14] (Surah Bani Isra'il - 13, 14).\nThen Hasan Basri رحمۃ اللہ علیہ\tsaid:\n\"By God! The Supreme Being has done a great justice in that He has appointed you to take account of your own actions\". (Ibn Kathir)\nObviously the book or the ledger of deeds would not be made up of mundane paper, so that there should be any difficulty in understanding how it will go with him in the grave and remain there with him until the Day of Resurrection. It is a transcendental reality, the actual nature of which is known only to Allah. Therefore, it should not be surprising if the book is put as a garland round the neck and remains there until the Day of Resurrection."

Sayyidna Hasan Basri and Qatadah رحمۃ اللہ علیہما said that this angel records every single word - whether or not it is sinful or reward-able. Ibn ` Abbas ؓ said that only those utterances are recorded that are sinful or rewardable. Ibn Kathir, having quoted both these views, preferred the first view on the basis of the general words of the verse that every utterance is recorded. According to another narration of Sayyidna Abu Talhah ؓ from Ibn ` Abbas ؓ both the views can be accommodated. This narration states that in the first instance every utterance is recorded, whether or not it is sinful or rewardable. Once a week on Thursdays, the angels review the recorded utterances and retain only those that are sinful or rewardable, good or bad; the rest are discounted. Thus the Qur'an says: يَمْحُو اللَّـهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ \"Allah wipes off what He wills and affirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother Book.\" (Ar-Ra` d 39)\nImam Ahmad (رح) has reported from Sayyidna Bilal Ibn Harith Al-Muzani ؓ that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has said:\n\"Verily, a man sometime utters a good word that pleases Allah, unaware of how highly it wi11 be rewarded, and on its account Allah decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. Similarly, a man might utter a word that angers Allah, unaware of how dreadful its punishment will be, and on its account Allah decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.\"\nSayyidna ` Alqamah ؓ ، after narrating this from Bilal Ibn Harith ؓ ، used to say: \"How many words did I not utter because of this hadith.\" (Ibn Kathir)"

The verse before this depicts the way the Day of Judgment will be established. This verse describes the way in which all human beings will be brought to the plane of Hashr. With every man there will be a Sa'iq and a Shahid. Sa'iq, literally, denotes a person who remains behind a herd of animals or behind a group of people and drives them to a particular place. And Shahid refers to a witness. As for Sa'iq, by the consensus of traditions, it refers to an angel. But there are different views of scholars of Tafsir regarding Shahid. Some say that it too refers to an angel. In this way, there are two angels - Sa'iq and Shahid. Sa'iq's duty is to drive the people to the gathering place, and Shahid's task is to bear witness when the people's deeds will be presented. Another possible interpretation is that these two angels refer to the \"honorable scribes\" who used to accompany human beings all the time in the world on the right and left to record their deeds. A third possibility is that they refer to some other angels besides the ones mentioned here.\nSome scholars interpret Shahid as referring to man's action, and other scholars think that the reference is to man himself. Ibn Kathir opines that the apparent context of the verse indicates that Shahid is also an angel who will bear witness to man's actions. Sayyidna ` Uthman Ibn ` Affan ؓ whilst delivering a sermon recited this verse and said: \"Sa` iq will drive every person to Allah, and Shahid will testify about what one has done.\" Interpreters like Sayyidna Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zaid ؓ placed the same interpretation on the two names.

There is a difference of opinion regarding the addressees of this verse. The preferred opinion is that Allah addresses mankind in general. This includes the believers, the unbelievers, the pious and the wicked. Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir and others have adopted this interpretation. The analogy drawn here is that this world is like the dream-world and the Hereafter is like the state of wakefulness. When man is in the dream-world, his eyes are closed and cannot perceive by his physical organs of sight the stark realities of the next world. When the physical organs of sight close, his dream-world ends and the state of wakefulness begins, and he is able to discern the stark realities of the Hereafter. Therefore, scholars have formulated the following aphorism:\nالنَّاسُ نِیَامُ فَاذِا مَاتُوا اِنتَبَھُوا\n\"People are sleeping in this world; when they die, they will wake up."

The word qarin (translated above as 'companion) refers to the recording angel that accompanies man all the time. Earlier we have learnt that there are two angels that record deeds. In the preceding verse they were referred to as Sa'iq and Shahid. The context indicates that, on the Day of Resurrection, the two scribes will be entrusted with two different tasks. One, named as Sa'iq, will drive the people to the gathering place, and the second, named as Shahid will carry the records of deeds and it is this angel who, after reaching the plane of Hashr, will say, هَـٰذَا مَا لَدَيَّ عَتِيدٌ \"This is what I have with me, ready (to be presented as his record of deeds).\" Ibn Jarir, in his tafsir, states that the word garin comprehends both the angels Sa'iq and Shahid."

The word qarin literally denotes a companion, that is, one who accompanies or associates with another. From this point of view, qarin in the preceding verse referred to the two angels that accompany human beings and record their deeds. Just as there are two angels in the company of man, there is a devil entrusted to every man, who calls him towards commission of sins, and thus leads him astray. In this verse qarin refers to that devil. When it will be ordered that the person be thrown into Hell, it seems that he will say that the devil had led him astray, otherwise he would have done righteous deeds. In response, the devil will disown him and say about the human who came on the Day of Resurrection as an unbeliever that \"I did not lead him astray. In fact he himself was misguided, paying no heed to the truth\". In response Allah will say what follows in the next verse."

I memorized Surah Qaf from the Holy Prophet ﷺ who used to recite it every Friday while standing on the pulpit delivering the Friday sermon to the people.\"\nSayyidna ` Umar Ibn-ul-Khattab ؓ asked Abu Waqid Al-Laithi: \"What did the Holy Prophet ﷺ recite during the ` Id prayers?\" He replied: \"Surah Qaf and Surah Qamar.\" Sayyidna Jabir ؓ reports that the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to recite Surah Qaf often in the Morning Prayer. (Despite that this Surah is rather long,) the prayer was felt light (Qurtubi). It was the special trait of the recitation of the Holy Prophet ﷺ that praying behind him caused no stress, even when he recited the long Surahs.\nIs it Possible to Observe the Heaven?\nأَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُ‌وا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ (Did they not, then, look to the sky above them? - 50:6). Apparently this sentence indicates that it is possible to see the sky, while the general impression is that the blue colour that we see above is the colour of the atmosphere, and not that of the heaven. However, there is no proof for non-existence of the sky, nor of the presumption that the colour of the heaven is not blue. Besides, the word nazar (seeing) used in the verse could mean perceiving through reason, that is, thinking, pondering etc. (Bayan-ul-Qur’ an)"

That is to say, Paradise has been promised to every person who is awwab and hafiz. Awwab refers to the person who turns to Allah. Here it means who turns to Him in repentance against sins. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud, Sha` bi and Mujahid ؓ said that Awwab refers to a person who recalls his sins in loneliness, private and secret, and seeks Allah's forgiveness. ` Ubaid Ibn ` Umair ؓ said that Awwab is one who seeks Allah's forgiveness of his sins in every sitting. And he further said that we are advised to recite the following invocation:\nسُبحانَ اللہِ وَ بِحَمدِہٖ اللَّھُمَّ اِنِّی اَستغفِرُکَ مِمَّآ اَصَبتُ فِی مَجلِسِی ھٰذا\n\"Pure is Allah and praise be to Him. 0 Allah, I seek Your forgiveness of the evil that I might have committed in this sitting.\"\nIn a Prophetic Tradition, we are advised to recite the following supplication when dispersing. Allah will forgive all the sins that might have been committed in that session:\nسُبحَانَکَ اللَّھُمَّ وَ بِحَمدِکَ لَٓا اِلٰہَ اِلَّا اَنتَ اَستغفِرُکَ وَ اَتُوبُ اِلَیکَ\n\"Pure are You, 0 Allah, and praise be to You. There is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn to You in penitence.\"\nHafiz (حَفِيظٍ ), according to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، is one who remembers his sins, so that he may return to Allah in penitence and make amends. Another report from him defines اَلحَفِظُ ھُوِ الحَافِظُ لِاَمرِ اللہِ haflz as one who remembers his covenant with Allah, and does not break or betray it. Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ reports from the Holy Prophet ﷺ who said: \"Whoever performs four rak` at of Ishraq prayer early in the day is Awwab and Hafiz (Qurtubi)."

It is recorded in Musnad of Ahmad on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Said Khudri ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"If anyone in Paradise wishes for children, the conception, delivery of the baby and its growth will all take place in a short span of time.\" (Ibn Kathir)\nThe second part of the verse states: وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ (and with Us there is even more.) In other words, there are with Allah such desirable delights which have not been conceived of by any man and, therefore, they could not wish or desire for them. Sayyidna Anas and Jabir ؓ said that \"more\" in this context refers to the greatest reward of enabling the people of Jannah to see Allah bila kaif [ without \"how\" or in an indescribable manner ].

The imperative verb sabbih is derived from the infinitive tasbih which originally means to declare or proclaim the purity of Allah. This comprehends the verbal declaration or proclamation and the worship, such as prayer. Therefore, some scholars say that tasbih before sunrise refers to the morning prayer, and tasbih before sunset refers to ` Asr (late afternoon) prayer. Sayyidna Jarir Ibn ` Abdullah ؓ reports from the Holy Prophet ﷺ [ as part of a long Tradition ]\nاِن اسَطَعتُم اَن لَّا تُغلَبُوا عَلیٰ صَلَوٰۃِ قَبلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمسِ وَقَبلَ غُرُوبِھَا، یَعنِی اَلعَصرَ وَ الفَجرَ ثُمَّ قَرَأ جَرِیر ؓ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ الْغُرُ‌وبِ ۔ (بخاری و مسلم و اللفظ لمسلم)\n\"So if you can avoid missing the prayer before the sunrise and the prayer before sunset, that is the 'Asr prayer and the morning prayer, you must do so.\" (Bukhari and Muslim the wordings of Muslim: vide Qurtubi)\nAlthough according to the majority of commentators, tasbih in the verse refers to salah (prayer), yet the general words of tasbih include all those invocations also the recitation of which is encouraged by authentic ahadith at the time of morning and evening. Bukhari and Muslim have recorded a Tradition on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\n\"If you recite morning and evening سُبحَانَ اللہ subhanallah a hundred times, no one will bring, on the Day of Judgment, a virtuous act better than it, except those who would recite the same tasbih in the same number or even more than that.\"\nIn the same collections, a narration by the same authority, says that whosoever recites subhanallahi wa bi hamdihi one hundred times in a day, his sins will be forgiven, even though they may be more than the waves of the sea.

The disbelievers wondered at the idea that when they are dead and reduced to broken bones and particles of dust and scattered all over the world, whether it is possible that, on the Day of Resurrection, they will be raised up again. They thought that it was impossible when they are dead, disintegrated, with their organs torn apart that they will be brought back to their original shape and bodies. The verse refutes the disbelievers' objection: Allah says that He knows that which the earth takes of them, meaning He knows what the earth consumes of their dead bodies; where and how the bodies disintegrated, what they turned into and how they have become. Man's knowledge is limited and narrow in scope which should not be compared to Allah's vast, unlimited and encompassing knowledge - even the particles of objects which the earth disintegrates are well preserved in Allah's infinite knowledge. And a little reflection may reveal that even the body of a living person is composed of innumerable particles that have been joined together by Allah from different places. Whatever a person intakes in the form of food or medicine is derived from different parts of the earth, and all this forms part of his body. Then why should it be difficult for Him if He recollects all these parts after they are disintegrated? Not only this, he had a perfect and full knowledge of every man's destiny even before creating him as to what transformation will come about in every moment of his life and what phases he will go through after his death. All this is precisely recorded in the Preserved Tablet.\nIt is astonishing indeed that the disbelievers wonder at Him whose knowledge is so perfect, full, complete and encompassing and whose power is so infinite and discount the possibility of Resurrection!\nThis interpretation of 'diminishing by earth' is reported from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas, Mujahid and majority of the interpreters (Al-Bahr-ul-Muhit).\nفِي أَمْرٍ‌ مَّرِ‌يجٍ (so they are in a confused state... 5). The word Mar, (translated above as 'confused' ) means something mixed up with different elements. Such a thing generally becomes corrupt or spoiled. Therefore, Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ ، translates the word marij as \"corrupt\". Sayyidna Dahhak, Qatadah, Hasan Basri رحمۃ اللہ علیہم and others interpret the word marij to mean \"in disarray, in a confused state\". This is the state of those who deny the prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ : whatever they say and utter is no more than confusion. They are not even consistent in their claims. Sometimes they call the Holy Prophet ﷺ a sorcerer, at other times a poet; and yet at other times they refer to him as a soothsayer or an astrologer. They were so confused that they could not extricate themselves from their perplexity."

It is recorded in Jami` Tirmidhi, on the authority of Sayyidna Mu` awiyah Ibn Hayadah ؓ ، that the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، pointing towards Syria, said:\nمِن ھٰھُنَا اِلیٰ ھٰھُنَا تُحشَرُونَ رُکبَاناً وَّ مُشَاۃً وَّ تُجَرُّونَ علیٰ وُجُھِکُم یَومَ القِیامَۃ\n\"From here towards that [ pointing towards Syria ] you will be raised, some riding, and others on foot, and yet others will be dragged on the faces on the Day of Judgment...\""

This means that the message of the Qur'an is to be conveyed to the entire mankind, to all and sundry. However, only those who fear Allah and dread His torment will remember and heed. Qatadah used to recite this verse and supplicate in the following words:\nاَللّٰھُمَّ اجعَلنَا مِمَّن یَّخَافُ وَعِیدَکَ وَ یَرجُوا مَوعوُدَکَ یَا بَارُّ یَا رَحِیمُ\n\"0 Allah!

      "text": "Removal of a Doubt relating to Resurrection\nقَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الْأَرْ‌ضُ مِنْهُمْ (We know very well how much of them is diminished by the earth,... 50:4). The disbelievers wondered at the idea that when they are dead and reduced to broken bones and particles of dust and scattered all over the world, whether it is possible that, on the Day of Resurrection, they will be raised up again. They thought that it was impossible when they are dead, disintegrated, with their organs torn apart that they will be brought back to their original shape and bodies. The verse refutes the disbelievers' objection: Allah says that He knows that which the earth takes of them, meaning He knows what the earth consumes of their dead bodies; where and how the bodies disintegrated, what they turned into and how they have become. Man's knowledge is limited and narrow in scope which should not be compared to Allah's vast, unlimited and encompassing knowledge - even the particles of objects which the earth disintegrates are well preserved in Allah's infinite knowledge. And a little reflection may reveal that even the body of a living person is composed of innumerable particles that have been joined together by Allah from different places. Whatever a person intakes in the form of food or medicine is derived from different parts of the earth, and all this forms part of his body. Then why should it be difficult for Him if He recollects all these parts after they are disintegrated? Not only this, he had a perfect and full knowledge of every man's destiny even before creating him as to what transformation will come about in every moment of his life and what phases he will go through after his death. All this is precisely recorded in the Preserved Tablet.\nIt is astonishing indeed that the disbelievers wonder at Him whose knowledge is so perfect, full, complete and encompassing and whose power is so infinite and discount the possibility of Resurrection!\nThis interpretation of 'diminishing by earth' is reported from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas, Mujahid and majority of the interpreters (Al-Bahr-ul-Muhit).\nفِي أَمْرٍ‌ مَّرِ‌يجٍ (so they are in a confused state... 5). The word Mar, (translated above as 'confused' ) means something mixed up with different elements. Such a thing generally becomes corrupt or spoiled. Therefore, Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ ، translates the word marij as \"corrupt\". Sayyidna Dahhak, Qatadah, Hasan Basri رحمۃ اللہ علیہم and others interpret the word marij to mean \"in disarray, in a confused state\". This is the state of those who deny the prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ : whatever they say and utter is no more than confusion. They are not even consistent in their claims. Sometimes they call the Holy Prophet ﷺ a sorcerer, at other times a poet; and yet at other times they refer to him as a soothsayer or an astrologer. They were so confused that they could not extricate themselves from their perplexity."
