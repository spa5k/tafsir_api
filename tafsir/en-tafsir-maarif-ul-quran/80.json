      "text": "Commentary\nCircumstance of Revelation\nSayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ ، the companion of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was a blind man. It once happened that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was engaged in a talk with the leaders of Quraish about some matters of belief. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ arrived there. Imam Baghawi adds that being blind and unable to see the surroundings, he did not realise that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was occupied with the others. He, therefore, burst into the circle and called the Holy Prophet repeatedly. [ Mazhari ]. According to Ibn Kathir, he requested the Holy Prophet ﷺ to teach him a verse of the Qur’ an and insisted an immediate enlightenment on the question. On that occasion, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was occupied with the non-believing leaders of Makkah in the hope that they would embrace the faith of Islam. The leaders to whom the Holy Prophet ﷺ was speaking were ` Utbah Ibn Rabi` ah, Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and the Holy Prophet's ﷺ uncle ` Abbas ؓ [ who had until then not embraced the Islamic faith ].\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ disliked the intrusion, and showed his displeasure by turning aside from Sayyidth ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum, thinking that he was a committed Muslim who frequently visited him, and therefore he could speak to him at another appropriate time. There was no religious loss in postponing the response to him. On the other hand, the Quraish leaders neither frequented the Holy Prophet's ﷺ company, nor could the Word of Allah be conveyed to them at any time. At that particular moment, they were listening to the Holy Prophet ﷺ .\" discourse and there was hope that they would embrace the Islamic faith. But if the conversation was rashly interrupted, apparently they would have been deprived of the faith. In view of this situation, the Holy Prophet  showed adverse reaction by turning aside from` Abdul)-ah Ibn umm Maktum ؓ ، and continued his discourse with the Quraish leaders. When the assembly broke up, the verses of Surah ` Abas were revealed to record Allah's dislike for this attitude, and to give directions for future.\nThis attitude of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was based on ijtihad or 'an opinion based on personal reasoning'. He thought that if a Muslim were to adopt a speech style that is not in keeping with etiquettes of a gathering, he needs to be reprimanded, so that in future he may be careful in future. That is the reason why Holy Prophet ﷺ turned his face away from Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ . Secondly, disbelief (kufr) and polytheism (shirk) are the most severe sins, and an effort to eradicate them should take priority over the subsidiary precepts of Islam on which Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ asked for enlightenment. Allah Almighty, through this Surah, did not confirm the correctness of this ijtihad of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and explained to him that educating a genuine seeker will most certainly benefit him, while the benefit of discussion with the opponents (who disdainfully turn away their face when the Holy Prophet ﷺ talks to them) is shaky and doubtful. Doubtful thing cannot be preferred over certainty. As for the violation of etiquette committed by Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ ، its excuse is pointed out by the Holy Qur'an in the word 'blind'. It is indicated by this word that being a blind man, he could not see what the Holy Prophet ﷺ was doing and with whom he was engaged in conversation. Thus he was excusable, and was not liable to be subjected to aversion. This indicates that if an excusable person were to break any rule of etiquette unwittingly, he should not be reprimanded.\nعَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ (He [ the Holy Prophet ﷺ frowned and turned his face, 80:1). The word ` abasa means 'he frowned' and the word tawalla means 'he turned aside'. Since the reference here is to the Holy Prophet ﷺ who himself is addressed, the verbs should have been in the second person: 'you frowned and you turned aside'. But the Holy Qur'an on this occasion uses the third person in order to maintain the honour of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، as if this attitude were shown by some other person, and in a subtle way it alludes to the point that what the Holy Prophet ﷺ did was not befitting his high status. Then the next sentence وَمَا يُدْرِ‌يكَ (and what could tell you? ...80:3) alludes to the fact that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was excusable, because it did not come to his attention that the Companion is asking something whose effect will be certain and the effect of conversation with others is dubious. The second sentence abandons the third person, and switches to the second person in order to maintain the honour of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Had he not been addressed in second person at all, it might have created the impression that he is not addressed directly because of his unapproved conduct, which would have been an unbearable pain and grief for the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Just as the third person in the first statement is meant to show respect to him, the second person in the following sentence is also meant to honor and console him."

The principle laid down here makes it clear that the first requirement takes priority over the second one. It is improper to delay the first task (educating Muslims) because of the second task.

In this case, it would refer to the angels who convey the revelation, and Prophets ﷺ and their companions who write the revelation. The ` ulama' (knowledgeable persons) of the Muslim community' are also included in this term, because they too are envoys between the Holy Prophet and the Muslim community. The messenger of Allah is reported to have said that he who recites the Qur’ an and is an expert in the art of recitation, he will be with the honorable, righteous envoys. He who is not an expert in the art of recitation, but recites it correctly with difficulty, he shall receive double reward. [ Transmitted by Shaikhain from ` A'ishah - Mazhari ]. This shows that a non-expert will receive double reward - one for recitation of Qur’ an, and the other for bearing the difficulty. This also indicates that an expert will receive countless rewards. [ Mazhari ]\nThe preceding verses mentioned that the Qur’ an is exalted and that belief in it is incumbent. Subsequently, the rejecters of Qur’ an are cursed and they are warned against showing ingratitude towards Divine favours. That the Holy Qur'an is a great Divine blessing is understood only by the men of Divine knowledge and understanding. Further, there is the mention of those Divine favours that Allah confers on man since his inception to the end of his life. These are material and physical things that a man with basic intellect can understand. Human creation is mentioned, thus:\nمِنْ أَيِّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ (From which stuff did He [ Allah ] create him? From a drop of semen! ..80:18-19).\nFirst a question is raised: '0 man! Consider what Allah has created you from?' Since its reply is so obvious that there can be no other reply, the next verse itself says: 'From a drop of semen!' Thus the verse draws pointed attention to the very humble beginning of man, so that it may be brought home to him that Allah having created him from such an insignificant thing as a sperm-drop, created him and proportioned him:"

His stature, body-structure, his face, his length and breadth of the limbs, his joints, his eyes, nose and ears are all well-proportioned in their creation. If any limb or organ loses its proportion, man's face will go awry, and every activity will become a problem.\nThe word qaddara is derived from taqdir which is also used in the sense of 'predestination'. Taking the word in this sense, the verse may also mean here that when man is under creation in his mother's womb, Allah predetermines four things for him: his life span, his sustenance, his deeds and whether he would be miserable or happy [ as in the hadith of Ibn Mas’ ud ؓ recorded by Shaikhain ]."

The Holy Prophet ﷺ is reported to have put it thus: تحفَۃ المؤمِن الموت \"The gift of a believer is death.\" Moreover, there is a profound wisdom in death at macro level for the entire world.\nThe phrase فَأَقْبَرَ‌هُ fa-aqbarah (and put him into the grave) describes another blessing of Allah, in that when man is dead, he is not left lying on the earth like other animals where he might rot, blow up and burst [ and probably be ravaged by vultures or beasts ]. But, even after death, he is honoured in the most befitting manner. His body is washed ceremonially, enshrouded in clean cloths, and buried in a grave with respect.\nThis verse also indicates that it is obligatory to bury a dead human body."

How beautifully Akbar Allahabadi, the Urdu poet, versifies this principle:\nبے وفا سمجھیں تمہیں اہل حرم اس سے بچو دیر والے کج ادا کہ دیں یہ بدنامی بھلی\n'Protect yourselves from a position where people of the Haram (Muslims) call you unfaithful.\nAs opposed to this, if People of temple [ non-Muslims ] call you 'ill-mannered', (because of your faithfulness to your religion), this dishonor is better.\nThe following verses clarify the principles more elaborately:\nأَمَّا مَنِ اسْتَغْنَىٰ فَأَنتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّىٰ (As for the one who does not care [ about faith ], you are anxious to pursue him!...80:5-6).\nIn other words: 'Those who turn away from you and your religion, you are pursuing them under the hope that somehow they should become Muslims, while this is not your responsibility.

In the world, there are relationships between people that make one willing to lay down his life for the other, but on the Day of Resurrection there will be such horror and chaos that they will be unable to take care of anyone. In fact, even if one sees the other in front of him, he will turn away from him. They will try to flee from their brothers, from their mothers and fathers, from their spouses and their children. They will not be able to help any of them in the Hereafter, despite the natural attachment they had with them in the world. Normally, one is more anxious in this world about his parents than about his brothers, and he is more anxious about his wife and children than about his parents. Keeping this in view, the relationships, in the present verse, are arranged from lower order to higher order.\nThe Chapter ends on a note of warning to disbelievers that if they reject the Qur’ anic message and persist in opposition to the Holy Prophet ﷺ they will have to face a day of reckoning when misery, shame and ignominy will be their lot. The righteous believers, however, will reside in Gardens of Bliss, their faces beaming with joy and happiness."

The companion sought enlightenment and its benefit was certain. If the Holy Prophet ﷺ enlightened him on the topic, he would have purified himself and attained perfection. If that did not happen, he would have at least attained the basic benefit of Divine remembrance. He would have improved the love and fear of Allah in his heart. The word dhikra means 'to remember Allah abundantly' [ Sihah ].1\n(1) This interpretation is based on taking the word 'dhikra' in the sense of remembrance of Allah'. However, some other exegetes have taken this word to mean 'advice', and the translation of the text, as well as the explanation following in the next paragraph, is based on it. (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)\nOn this occasion, the Qur’ an has used two sentences yazzakka and yazzakkaru. The first statement signifies 'to be purified' and the second statement signifies 'he may take heed and the reminder may benefit him'. The first stage is that of the 'righteous' who cleanse their inner and outer selves. The second stage is that of mubtadi 'beginners on the spiritual journey'. At this stage, the beginner is reminded of Allah which enhances the greatness and awe of Allah in his heart. The two sentences are disjoined by disjunctive particle sau (or) and technically they are not necessarily exclusive to one another. The sense is that` Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum ؓ would have attained either both benefits, or at least, the second one, that is, increase in Allah's remembrance and in His awe, which is the initial step towards perfection\nAn Important Qur’ anic Principle of Teaching and Preaching\nOn this occasion, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was faced with two different requirements at the same time. On the one hand, he was required to teach a Muslim and to encourage him on attaining perfection. On the other hand, he had to provide guidance to non-Muslims. The principle laid down here makes it clear that the first requirement takes priority over the second one. It is improper to delay the first task (educating Muslims) because of the second task. This indicates that education of Muslims and their reform are more important than, and take priority over, getting the non-Muslims to embrace the faith.\nScholars should avoid any such indulgence when disposing of any doubts of the non-Muslims, which may create doubts or complaints in the minds of the general body of Muslims. The teachers, preachers and reformers need to keep in mind these Qur’ anic guidelines to maintain the welfare and priority of the Muslims. How beautifully Akbar Allahabadi, the Urdu poet, versifies this principle:\nبے وفا سمجھیں تمہیں اہل حرم اس سے بچو دیر والے کج ادا کہ دیں یہ بدنامی بھلی\n'Protect yourselves from a position where people of the Haram (Muslims) call you unfaithful.\nAs opposed to this, if People of temple [ non-Muslims ] call you 'ill-mannered', (because of your faithfulness to your religion), this dishonor is better.\nThe following verses clarify the principles more elaborately:\nأَمَّا مَنِ اسْتَغْنَىٰ فَأَنتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّىٰ (As for the one who does not care [ about faith ], you are anxious to pursue him!...80:5-6).\nIn other words: 'Those who turn away from you and your religion, you are pursuing them under the hope that somehow they should become Muslims, while this is not your responsibility. If they do not embrace the faith, there will be no blame on you.\nThereafter, in verses 13 and 14, Allah Almighty has described the high status of the Holy Qur’ an, thus:"
