In other words We gave him wisdom and We said to him ‘Give thanks to God for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his gratitude shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for a grace then surely God is Independent without need of His creation Praised’ in what He does."
