The following verse was then revealed But when they sight some opportunity for business or a diversion they scatter off towards it that is towards the business since it is what they seek more than diversion and leave you during the sermon standing. Say ‘That which is with God in the way of reward is better for those who believe than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers’. They say that every person ‘provides for’ yarzuqu his dependants by which they mean that such a person does so by means of the provision given by God min rizqi’Llāhi exalted be He."

Evil is the likeness of the people who deny God’s signs those confirming the truth of the Prophet s — the object of rebuke is omitted but is implied to be hādhā’l-mathalu ‘this likeness’. And God does not guide the evildoing folk the disbelievers."
