And count the prescribed period keep record of it so that you may repeal your decision before it is concluded; and fear God your Lord obey Him in His commands and prohibitions. Do not expel them from their houses nor let them go forth from them until their prescribed period is concluded unless they commit a blatant act of indecency such as adultery read mubayyana or mubayyina corresponding respectively to buyyinat ‘one that has been proven’ and bayyina ‘blatant’ in which case they are brought out in order to carry out the prescribed legal punishment against them. And those mentioned stipulations are God’s bounds; and whoever transgresses the bounds of God has verily wronged his soul. You never know it may be that God will bring something new to pass afterwards after the divorce such as a retraction in the event that it was the first or second declaration of divorce."
