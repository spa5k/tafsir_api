Not equal to the rest of you are those of you who expended and fought before the victory at Mecca. Such are greater in rank than those who expended and fought afterwards. Yet to each of the two groups a variant reading for wa-kullan ‘yet to each’ has nominative wa-kullun as a subject God has promised the best reward Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly."
