You offer you communicate to them the Prophet’s plan s to attack them which he had confided to you and had kept secret at Hunayn communicating this to them out of affection between you and them. Hātib b. Abī Balta‘a sent them a letter to that effect on account of his having children and close relatives idolaters among them. The Prophet s intercepted it from the person to whom he Hātib had given it to deliver after God apprised him of this. Hātib’s excuse for this conduct of his was accepted by the Prophet; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you that is in the religion of Islam and the Qur’ān expelling the Messenger and you from Mecca by oppressing you because you believe in God your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure … the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded that is to say understand it as being ‘then do not take them as friends’. You secretly harbour affection for them when I know well what you hide and what you proclaim. And whoever among you does that that is to secretly communicate the Prophet’s news to them has verily strayed from the right way he has missed the path of guidance originally al-sawā’ means ‘the middle way’."

      "text": "O you who believe when believing women come to you saying with their tongues that they are emigrating from the company of disbelievers — this was following the truce concluded with them the disbelievers at al-Hudaybiyya to the effect that if any of their number should go to join the believers that person should be sent back — test them by making them swear that they had only gone forth from Mecca because of their sincere wish to embrace Islam and not out of some hatred for their disbelieving husbands nor because they might be enamoured by some Muslim man that was how the Prophet s used to take from them their oaths. God knows best the state of their faith. Then if you know them if you suppose them on the basis of their oaths to be believers do not send them back to the disbelievers. They the women are not lawful for them nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them. And give them that is to say their disbelieving husbands what they have expended on them on such women in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them on that previous condition when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on read tumassikū or tumsikū to the conjugal ties of disbelieving women your wives for your Islam automatically prohibits you from this or to the ties of those apostatising women who return to the idolaters for likewise their apostatising automatically prohibits you from marrying them and ask for demand the return of what you have expended on these women of dowries in the event of apostasy from those disbelievers to whom they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended on those women who have emigrated as explained above that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you therewith and God is Knower Wise."

And fear God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the way of paying back the disbelievers the dowries of their former wives and the believers the dowries of the women who had apostatised. Afterwards however this stipulation was annulled."

As for his saying but I cannot avail you anything against God’ — that is either against His chastisement or to secure for you of His reward — he Abraham is using it to intimate to his father that he can do nothing for him other than to ask forgiveness for him which saying is itself based on that former statement albeit excepted from it in terms of what is meant by it even if on the face of it it would seem to be semantically part of the good example to be followed Say ‘Who can avail you anything against God’ Q. 4811; his Abraham’s plea of forgiveness for him was before it became evident to him that he his father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114. ‘Our Lord in You we put our trust and to You we turn penitently and to You is the journeying these are the words of the Friend of God Abraham and those who were with him in other words they were saying"
