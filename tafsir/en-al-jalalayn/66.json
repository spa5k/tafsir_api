Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa who had been away but who upon returning and finding out became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying ‘She is unlawful for me!’ seeking by making her unlawful for you to please your wives? And God is Forgiving Merciful having forgiven you this prohibition."

They were under two of Our righteous servants yet they betrayed them in their religion for they both disbelieved — Noah’s wife called Wāhila used to say to his people that he was a madman while Lot’s wife called Wā‘ila used to tell his people the whereabouts of his guests when they stayed with him at night by lighting a fire and during the day by making smoke. So they that is Noah and Lot did not avail the two women in any way against God against His chastisement and it was said to the two women ‘Enter both of you the Fire along with the incomers’ from among the disbelievers of the peoples of Noah and Lot."

Ibn Kaysān said ‘She was raised to Paradise alive where she eats and drinks’."

Muqātil b. Sulaymān said ‘He set free a slave in expiation for his prohibition of Māriya’; whereas al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘He never expiated because the Prophet s has been forgiven all errors’. And God is your Protector your Helper and He is the Knower the Wise."

So when he told her about it she said ‘Who told you this?’ He said ‘I was told by the Knower the Aware’ namely God."
