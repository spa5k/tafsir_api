There were seven of these arrows marked with flags and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka‘ba. They would use them for abitrations and when they commanded them they obeyed and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wickedness a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of ‘Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage the following was revealed Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion of you apostatising from it having hoped for it earlier for now they perceived its strength; therefore do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you that is its rulings and obligations after this verse nothing about what is lawful or unlawful was revealed and I have completed My favour upon you by perfecting it your religion but it is also said by effecting their safe entry into Mecca; and I have approved chosen Islam for you as religion. But whoever is constrained by emptiness by hunger to consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it not inclining purposely to sin to an act of disobedience — then God is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful to him by permitting it to him in contrast to the one who purposely inclines to sin that is the one actively engaged in it such as a waylayer or a criminal for whom such consumption is forbidden."
