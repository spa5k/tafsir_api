Yet they are by virtue of the enormous size of their figures yet in their lack of comprehension like blocks of timber read khushbun or khushubun that have been propped-up set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry made like a battle-cry or one made to retrieve a lost camel is directed against them because of the extent of terror in their hearts lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy so beware of them for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them! destroy them! How can they deviate? how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs for it have been established?"
