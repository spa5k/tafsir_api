  "text": "Not equal are the two oceans, this one sweet, satisfying, delicious to drink, that one salty, bitter. This verse alludes to two states: turning toward God and turning away from God. Those who turn toward God are occupied with obeying Him and recognizing Him. Those who turn away from Him are shut off from worshiping Him and protest against His apportioning and decree. The former is the cause of union, and the latter the cause of deprivation and separation. These are two different oceans, one delicious and the other bitter, standing between the servant and God. One is the ocean of destruction, the other the ocean of salvation. This is their likeness: Five ships are traveling in the ocean of destruction: avarice, eye-service, persistence in acts of disobedience, heedlessness, and despair. Whoever sits in the ship of avarice will reach the shore of love for this world. Whoever sits in the ship of eye-service will reach the shore of hypocrisy. Whoever sits in the ship of persistence in acts of disobedience will reach the shore of wretchedness. Whoever sits in the ship of heedlessness will reach the shore of remorse. Whoever sits in the ship of despair will reach the shore of unbelief. As for the ocean of salvation, five ships are traveling on it: fear, hope, renunciation, recogni- tion, and tawḤīd. Whoever sits in the ship of fear will reach the shore of security. Whoever sits in the ship of hope will reach the shore of bestowal. Whoever sits in the ship of renunciation will reach the shore of proximity. Whoever sits in the ship of recognition will reach the shore of inti- macy. Whoever sits in the ship of tawḤīd will reach the shore of contemplation. The Pir of the Tariqah gave an eloquent admonition to his companions and friends. He said, “Dear friends, it is time to seek salvation from this ocean of destruction and rise up from this pit of lassitude. Do not sell subsistent bliss for this evanescent house! “A soul without service is estranged. Do not nurture the estranged! A heart without wakeful- ness is a ghoul. Do not be the companion of a ghoul! A soul without awareness is wind. Do not live in the wind! Do not be satisfied with name and description in place of meaning and reality! Do not feel secure from hidden deception! Always be careful about the outcome of the work at the last breath!” That poet spoke sweet words in fine verses: O heart, if you want the afterworld, keep your claws back from this world! Trade in gambling away life and choosing religion's road! Put your foot on this world and sew up the eye of name and reputation, seize hold of the afterworld and close down the road of pride and honor."
