  "text": "A book inscribed, witnessed by those given proximity. Those given proximity are the folk of proximity. I am not talking about the proximity of distance, but the proximity of friendship. Today they are near, and tomorrow they will be near, living above the Throne. It is not that today they are far and tomorrow they will be near, or today they are ab- sent and tomorrow they will be present. Today they are exactly what they will be tomorrow, and tomorrow they will be exactly what they are today. He who is given proximity is he whose ears will not be distracted by the sound of the Trum- pet, nor his eyes by paradise. When someone sees Him, what else will come into his eyes? When someone hears from Him, what else will enter his ears? When someone has found the good news of proximity with Him, how can he be happy with anything other than Him? How can he who is given proximity be aware of the sound of the Trumpet, or be preoccu- pied by the terror of the Resurrection, or be touched by the smoke of hell, or cling to the bliss of paradise? Today the whole world is full of creatures, but they are with the One. Tomorrow all creatures will be drowned in bliss, but they will still be with the One. In glorifying You enough for me is to describe Your beauty. Of the eight paradises enough for me is union with You. Everyone's heart has a different goal- enough goal for my heart is Your image."
