  "text": "He effaces whatsoever He will, and He affirms. Know that the highway of the Real's religion is three things: submission, the Sunnah, and self- purification. In submission be fearful, in the Sunnah be hopeful, and in self-purification be a lover. Submission has no escape from fear, the Sunnah must have hope, and self-purification is nothing but the foundation of the lover. To the fearful it is said, \" Be afraid! \" To the hopeful it is said, \" Keep on seeking! \" To the lover it is said, \" Keep on burning! \" In the end the address will come to the fearful, \" Fear not! [41:30]. Do not fear, for the days of fear have come to an end. \" To the hopeful will be said, \" Grieve not! [41:30]. Have no sorrow, for your hope has been reached and the tree of joy has grown. \" To the lovers will be said, \" Rejoice! [41:30]. Be happy, for the night of separation has ended and the morning of union has come. \" Each of these things has its own path of effacement and affirmation in the world. From the hearts of the fearful He erases eye-service and puts certainty, He erases stinginess and puts gen- erosity, He erases avarice and puts contentment, He erases envy and puts tenderness, He erases innovation and puts the Sunnah, He erases fright and puts security. From the hearts of the hopeful He erases free choice and deposits surrender, He erases disper- sion and deposits togetherness, He erases perplexity and deposits the precedent light. From the hearts of the lovers He erases the customs of human nature and deposits the marks bearing witness to the Haqiqah, He decreases the marks bearing witness to the servant and in- creases the marks bearing witness to Himself. Then, just as he was at first, so also he will be at last. The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" O God, the majesty of Your exaltedness left no room for allu- sions. Your effacing and affirming took away the path of ascription-I lost all that I had in hand. O God, Yours kept on increasing and mine decreasing until at last there remained only what there was at first. \" Tribulation lies only in the makeup of my water and clay."
