  "text": "Man was created of haste. I shall show you My signs, so seek not to hasten Me. Man was created of haste. Haste is one thing, hurry is something else. Haste is unapproved and blamed, and a prohibition has come concerning it: “so seek not to hasten Me.” Hurry is approved and praised, and a command has come in it: “Hurry!” [3:133]. Haste is to go forth to a work before its moment, and hurry is to rush to a work that is commanded at the beginning of its moment. Haste is the result of Satan's disquieting, and hurry is a requisite of success-giving and reverence for the command. From haste come regret and the heart's turmoil, and from hurry the joining of spirit and heart with tranquility: He it is who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the faithful [48:4]. God sends down repose on the hearts of the faithful so that they will recognize Him without having found Him and love Him without having seen Him. They turn away from their own work to His work, they come from remembering themselves to remembering Him, and they go from love for themselves to love for Him. All rememberings save remembering Him are negligence, all objects of desire save His object of desire are diversions, and all loves save love for Him are idle talk."
