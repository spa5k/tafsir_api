  "text": "Surely the pious shall drink of a cup whose mixture is of camphor. In truth tomorrow in paradise the good people and the good men will drink wine from the cup of gentleness, a wine in the color of camphor with the scent of musk, a wine in worthy measure- nothing less than worthy measure, nothing added to it. Less and unworthy are both defects, but paradise is free of defects."
