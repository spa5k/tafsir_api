      "text": "By the era! Surely man is in loss. The Real swears an oath by the days and the time, which are the locus of taking heed for the gazer and the trace of the power of the Powerful: The Adamite is always in decrease and loss, his life in ruins. He is destitute and bewildered in the passing days. Every day that passes him by in his heedlessness is one part of his decreasing life, bringing him closer to the Last Day. He travels in decrease and fancies that he is increasing. He brings forth disobedience as ready cash and throws off obedience for tomorrow. You said you'd do the work fully tomorrow. Who gives you the assurance of tomorrow? God's Messenger, who was the paragon and the best of creation, the chosen and pulled up by the Real, said that he never got up in the morning expecting to reach the evening, and he never slept in the evening expecting to reach the morning; that he never put a morsel in his mouth supposing that he would finish eating it before he died. That paragon often used to say in supplication, “O Lord, give me a life in the sweetness of obedience, give me a death pure of alienation and slipping, and bring me into Your Presence neither shamed by my deeds nor embarrassed by the passing days.”"
