  "text": "On the day when the trembler trembles and the successor follows it, hearts on that day will be quivering, their eyes humbled. O indigent man! Today's disregard is tomorrow's loss. You have been given an ornament and some capital. The ornament is your soul and the capital is your breath. Put your soul to work and do not waste your breath! Keep the one flourishing and trade with the other so that tomorrow you may see the profit of the trade. How beautifully that chevalier said it in these lines! “And if today in this domicile you have a state of loss, what fine capital and fervor you'll see tomorrow! If you come from the field of appetite to the portico of intellect, you'll see yourself like Saturn in the seventh sphere. If you stroll toward the Holy Presence with exaltedness, you'll see steeds coming forth from the city of the Lord.” [DS 705-6]"
