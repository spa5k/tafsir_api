  "text": "They will have a known provision; fruits-and they will be honored. In the Garden they will have a known provision for their outer skins at designated moments, morn- ing and evening, and they will have a known provision for their secret cores at every moment. YaḤyā Muʿādh was asked, “Does the Beloved ever turn His face toward the lover?” He said, “When does the Beloved ever turn His face away from the lover?” May a thousand spirits be sacrificed to the chevalier who knows the intimations of passion! God nurtures those who have the collar of love around their necks in the lap of bounty, the cradle of the Covenant, and the dome of proximity. He unveils to them His Essence and addresses them through His attributes. The Throne has the attribute of elevation, and elevation is enough for it. The Footstool has the attribute of tremendousness, and tremendousness is enough for it. Heaven has adornment and ornamentation, and adornment and ornamentation are enough for it. The soul has the claim to egoism, and the claim to egoism is enough for it. As for the heart, it does not have the elevation of the Throne, nor does it have the tremendousness of the Footstool, nor does it have the ornamentation of the heaven, nor does it have the expanse of the earth, nor does it have the claim to being and egoism-all it has is brokenness and poverty. “My bounty and mercy are enough for it. Say: 'In the bounty of God and His mercy-in that let them rejoice' [10:58].”"
