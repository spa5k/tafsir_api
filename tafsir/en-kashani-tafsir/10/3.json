There is no intercessor, to intercede for anyone by effusing perfection and extending a light with which to bring that person close to God and deliver him from the darknesses of the soul and purify him from the abomination of its attributes, save after, He grants [His] permission by bestowing preparedness, then by facilitating the causes [for that intercession]; that, one who is described by these attributes, is God, your Lord, who nurtures you and directs your affair, so single out worship for Him and know Him by these attributes. Do not worship Satan and do not veil yourself from Him through one of His attributes such that you then ascribe His words and His acts to Satan."
