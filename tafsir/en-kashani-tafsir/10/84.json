  "text": "And Moses said, 'O my people, if you have believed in God, a faith of certainty, then put your trust in Him: he has made trust as one of the concomitants of submission [to God], and it is the submission of one's countenance to God, exalted be He. But he did not make submission as a concomitant of faith, in other words, if your faith and certainty have become perfect in such a way that this has had an effect upon your souls and made them purely for God, annihilated in Him, then trust in Him must necessarily follow [from that]. For the first level of annihilation is the annihilation of acts, followed by the attributes then existence. Once annihilation is complete then trust must follow, which is the annihilation of the acts. If what is meant by islām is obedience, then it is a precondition for trust and not a concomitant thereof, in which case the meaning would be: if your faith is sound in terms of certainty, then trust in Him on the condition that you do not act and that you do not see yourselves or others as having any power or effective agency, but that you become obediently submissive, as one who is dead. For the precondition for the soundness of trust [in God] is the annihilation of the remnants of acts and the faculties, as they say, 'If you do not like this [kind of] tree, then pull it out if you can'. As for the remainder of the sūra to the end, some of it cannot be submitted to allegorical interpretation, and the rest is known from what has already been mentioned."
