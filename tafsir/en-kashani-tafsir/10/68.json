  "text": "They say, 'God has taken [to Him] a son', that is, a defective [thing] to correspond to Him in genus. Glory be to Him!: declare Him as transcendent above correponding in genus to anything. He is Independent, One who exists by His own Essence and by Whom everything comes to exist. How then can anything be like Himḍ And the One to whom all existence belongs: how can anything correspond to Himḍ"
