  "text": "God has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, being the Gardens of the souls, and dwellings, that are blessed, being the stations of the masters of trust [in God] in the Gardens of the acts, as evidenced in His words, exalted be He: and a greater beatitude from God, for beatitude belongs to the Gardens of the attributes. That, beatitude, is the supreme triumph, because of the nobleness of those who receive it in the eyes of God and their extreme closeness to Him."
