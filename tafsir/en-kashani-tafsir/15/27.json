  "text": "And the jānn, that is, the origin of the jinn, which is the substance of the animal spirit from which are generated the faculties of estimation and imagination as well as others; We created beforehand out of the permeative fire, that is to say, from natural heat and the vaporousness and subtlety of mixtures that are transformed thereby. He says 'beforehand' because the effect of heat on composition by means of admixture and tempering comes beforehand and the effect of that vapour on the form of the organs, nay, on the active effective faculties comes before the composition in the first place. As for the signification of the angels' compliance and Iblīs's non-compliance, that has already been mentioned."
