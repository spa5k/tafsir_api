  "text": "And verily We have given you seven, that is to say, the seven attributes which are confirmed for God, exalted be He, and which are: life, knowledge, power, will, hearing, vision and speech, of the oft-repeated [verses], whose confirmation has been repeated and reiterated for you, first at the station of the heart's presence upon your assumption of His character traits and His descriptions, such that they are yours; and second, at the station of subsistence by means of existence bestowed by the Truth after annihilation in the affirmation of Oneness, and the great QurÌān, that is, the all-comprehensive Essence that combines all of the attributes. Seven were given to Muḥammad, blessings and peace be upon him, and nine to Moses, because he [the latter] was not given the great QurÌān, but his station was that of being spoken to, that is, the station of the unveiling of the attributes to the exclusion of the unveiling of the Essence and thus his were the seven together with the heart and the spirit."
