  "text": "And We remove whatever rancour, that is, [whatever] firmly rooted malice or configuration that rises from the soul towards the aspect of the heart that is adjacent to it [that], may be in their breasts, by effusing light and the mastery of the faculty of the spirit and the reinforcement of the holy. Those are the ones whose darknesses have been overcome by their lights from among the folk of knowledge and certainty, and from whom, consequently, have been eliminated dark ego-centric configurations and the effects of enmity that are the concomitants of the falling down of the soul and its inclining to the world of contrareity, and in whom has radiated the faculty of primordial love by the mirroring of the holy rays and the lights of the affirmation of Oneness and certainty of some of them with [those of the] others such that they become brethren by virtue of the compact of faith and spiritual correspondence between them, upon couches, high levels, facing one another, because their degrees are the same, their levels near to one another and [because] they are not veiled."
