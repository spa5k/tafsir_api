He is the Wise, [One] who manages their affair at the gathering in accordance with [the exigencies of] wisdom and depending on [the nature of] correspondence [between them], the Knower, of all that is in them of hidden inclinations, attraction and love and what their configurations and attributes entail and thus recompense them for their descriptions."
