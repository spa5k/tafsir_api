  "text": "Verily, there are some among the People of the Scripture, that is, the ones who are veiled from the affirmation of Oneness and the ones described with the attribute of fluctuation in states and stations, who believe in God, [who] verify the affirmation of the unity of the Essence, and what has been revealed to you, of the knowledge of the affirmation of the Oneness and uprightness, and what has been revealed to them, of the knowledge of the origin and the final return, humble before God, receptive to the self-disclosure of the Essence, not purchasing with the verses of God, which are the self-disclosures of His attributes with the price of the remnants (baqiyya), described here as a paltry one. Those - their wage, of the mentioned gardens, is with their Lord. God is swift at reckoning, reckoning with them and recompensing them such that He requites the remnants of those of whom something has remained, or He rewards these remnants in accordance with the degrees merited in the three abodes."
