  "text": "And hold fast to God's bond, together, that is, [hold fast] to His covenant, the one [mentioned] in His statement: Am I not your Lord [Q. 7:172], united in affirmation of [Hi] Oneness; and do not separate from one another, with disagreeing opinions, for to be separated from the truth results from the divergence of natures and the pursuit of caprice as well as the mutual attraction of faculties. The affirmer of [His] Oneness is far removed from such [a predicament], because his heart has been illumined by the light of the Truth and his soul has been irradiated by the effusion of the heart, such that his faculties are at peace and in friendship with one another. And remember God's grace upon you, by way of [His] guiding you to the affirmation of Oneness that entails love in the hearts, when you were enemies, because of your being veiled with egocentric veils and the coverings of nature, far removed from the light, and [by] the universal goals that allow for association and which remain, by consensus, in the abyss of darkness; and He brought your hearts together, by making you love one another for God's sake so that these [hearts] might be illumined by His light; so that by His grace you became brothers, in religion, friends through God; and you were upon the brink of a pit of fire, which is the abyss into which fall wicked nature and the locus of privation and chastisement; but He delivered you from it, as a result of your true closeness with one another in pursuit of the Lote-tree of the station of the spirit and the spirit of the Paradise of the Essence. So God makes clear to you His signs, by means of the self-disclosures of [His] subtle attributes and [by His] luminous irradiations, that you might be guided, to His beauty and the self-disclosure of His Essence."
