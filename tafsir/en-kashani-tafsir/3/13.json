  "text": "There has already been a sign for you, O wayfaring folk, [a sign] that is proof of your perfection and your attainment of the affirmation of Oneness, in two hosts that met, one group, constituting the spiritual faculties, which are God's folk and His hosts, fighting in the way of God; and another, constituting the hosts of the soul and the assistants of the devils who are veiled from the Truth. You will see the former group twice the number of these [latter] when the two [groups] meet one another in the battle of the body, [and that is] because of the former group is aided by the light of God and His granting of success, while the latter group is forsaken and abased, incapable, too weak and severed from the world of [divine] aid and power. Thus the former group defeat the latter and subdue them with God's aid and assistance, and expend their property, namely, the objects of their perception and the objects of their knowledge in for the cause of knowing God and affirming His Oneness; for God confirms with His help whom He will, from among the recipients of His solicitude who are prepared for His encounter. Surely in that is a lesson, that is, a consideration or something to be considered in order to arrive at the truth for those endowed with the faculty of vision, the eyes of whose insights have been opened and coloured by the light of the certainty that comes from knowledge, from among the people of the spiritual path (ṭarīqa), by which they consider their states at the end."
