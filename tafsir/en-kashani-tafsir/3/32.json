  "text": "Say: 'Obey God, and the Messenger', in other words, if you are not loving [of him] and are not able to follow My beloved, then the least that you can do is to be willingly obedient to what you have been commanded, for the willing one must necessarily follow the command and comply with what he has been commanded to. But if they turn their backs, God loves not the disbelievers, that is, if they also refuse to do that, then they are disbelieving deniers who are veiled and God does not love the disbeliever. Refraining from obedience necessarily entails disbelief, whereas refraining from following [the prophet] does not necessarily entail that, because the one who refrains from following [the prophet] may still be obedient by following the command. The meaning of 'obey God and the Messenger' is 'obey the Messenger of God', because of God's saying: whoever obeys the Messenger, verily obeys God [Q. 4:80]."
