  "text": "And those who disbelieve say, 'Why has not some sign been sent down upon him from his Lord!': having become veiled, they did not see the signs that bore witness to [Muá¸¥ammad's] prophethood, such as his [the Prophet's] assumption of God's attributes, because of their non-perception and the blindness of their insights. That is why they did not reckon these as signs and requested them according to their vain desires. Your duty is only to warn them, and not to guide them, for guidance belongs to God; and for every folk there is a guide, who corresponds to them in terms of the genus-correspondence of primordial nature and so they acquire an affinity with him at the point of his perfection and his reception of the divine light cast upon him. They accept guidance from him and so God guides them according to His manifestation [in that guide]. Therefore, whoever corresponds to you in terms of that original genus-correspondence will receive guidance from you, and whoever does not, will not."
