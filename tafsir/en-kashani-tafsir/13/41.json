  "text": "Or is it that they have not seen how We visit the land, We seek out the land of the body at the moment of old age, diminishing it at its edgesḍ, by the [gradual] wearing away of its organs, the failure of its faculties and the weakening of its senses bit by bit until death. And God judges, in this way; there is none that can repel His judgement, none to avert or change His judgement. Or [it means that] We visit the land of the soul at the moment of wayfaring, diminishing it at its edges by annihilating its acts with Our acts first, as He has said, 'Through Me he hears and through Me he sees', then, second, by annihilating its attributes with Our attributes, as He has said, '[Until] I am his hearing with which he hears and his sight by which he sees', then by annihilating its essence by Our essence, as He has said to whom does Sovereignty belong on this dayḍ [Q. 40:16], responding Himself with His words To God, the One, the Vanquisher [Q. 40:16], since creation in its entirety will have been annihilated; thereupon there will be only God's judgement, judging as He will without any to repel His judgement since anything other than Him does not exist."
