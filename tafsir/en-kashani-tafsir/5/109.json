  "text": "on the day when God shall gather the messengers, at the source of absolute union, or the source of the union of the Essence, and He will say: 'What, answer have your communities given to you when you summoned them to Me. In other words, 'Do you [messengers] have any insight into their [spiritual] levels with regard to the perfections to which they oriented themselves when they followed you·∏ç'; they shall say, 'We have no knowledge, that is, all knowledge belongs to You, comprehensively and in differentiation, and none other than You has any knowledge, because our attributes have been annihilated in Your attributes. You, only You, are the Knower of things unseen', and so the unseens of our innermost aspects and their innermost aspects all constitute knowledge that is Yours."
