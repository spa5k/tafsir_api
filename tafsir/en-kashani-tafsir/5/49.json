  "text": "[God desires to smite them] for some of their sins, the sins of the Jews are the veilings of the acts, while the sins of the Christians are the veilings of the attributes. Thus the wickedness of the Jews is the infringement of the rules governing the self-disclosures of the divine acts by the soul's inspection of its own acts, while the wickedness of the Christians is the infringement of the rules governing the self-disclosures of the attributes of the Truth by the soul's inspection of its own attributes and its being veiled thereby. The wickedness of the Muá¸¥ammadans is their turning of their attention to their essences and infringing the rules governing the unity of the Essence."
