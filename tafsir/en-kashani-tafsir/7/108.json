  "text": "And he drew forth his hand, that is, he manifested his dazzling power which spellbound them and manifested the light of the truth of his summoning. It seems that the prevailing [art] in his time was sorcery, which is why he came out with the divine magic, while the prevailing [art] in the time of Muḥammad, blessings and peace be upon him, was rhetorical eloquence, which is why his miracle was the QurÌān. In the time of Jesus, peace be upon him, it was medicine, and so he brought them the divine medicine, as has been related, since each prophet's miracle must necessarily be of the genus of what is the prevalent aspect of his time, so that he might be more successful in having his call responded to."
