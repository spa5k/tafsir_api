The Prophet, blessings and peace be upon him, 'Lord God, establish my heart firmly upon Your religion', whereupon it was said to him, 'But has not God forgiven you your past sins and those that will beḍ', to which he replied, 'And what would assure me that the likeness of the heart is not as the likeness of a feather in an open expanse the winds turning it over as they wishḍ'."
