  "text": "[They will question you about the Hour]: what is meant by the Hour is the moment of the manifestation of the major resurrection, that is, the Essential unity, by the presence of the Messiah (MahdÄ«). But none except God knows that moment, as the Prophet, blessings and peace be upon him, said regarding the time of the emergence of the Messiah, 'Those who ascribe [to the Hour] a time are liars. By God, even when it comes it is also only God that knows it, just as [the case] is before its time comes'. It weighs heavily in the heavens and the earth, since the inhabitants of these are unable to embrace [any] knowledge of it."
