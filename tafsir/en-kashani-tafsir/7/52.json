The interpretation of this [verse] is [that it is a reference to] what is fulfilled by His command in the final sequel such as the transformation [of this body] into what cannot be used for that [perfection] at the Gathering in terms of configurations, forms and figures that correspond to their attributes and beliefs commensurate with His statement He will assuredly requite them for their descriptions [Q. 6:139] and where He says And We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf [Q. 17:97]."
