  "text": "[O Children of Adam! We have sent down on you] a garment to conceal your shameful parts, that is to say, a divine law that covers up the vile aspects of your descriptions and the lewdness of your acts, and feathers, that is, beauty that will distance you from any likeness to neglected cattle and that will adorn you with virtuous character traits and beautiful acts, and the garment of God-fearing, that is, the attribute of abstinence and caution against the atttibute of the soul, that is better, than the sum total of the pillars of the law, since it is the fundament and the basis of religion, much like [the role of] a restrictive diet in treatment [of maladies]; that is one of God's signs, that is, one of the lights of His attributes, since avoidance of the attributes of the soul is not actualised and is not facilitated except by the manifestation of the self-disclosures of the attributes of the Truth. This is what they [in the community] refer to when they say: 'God does not dispose of something that belongs to a servant except that He compensates him with something better of the same type'; perhaps they will remember, at the manifestation of the self-disclosures of your original spiritual garment, or the vicinity of the Truth which you used to inhabit by the guidance of the lights of the attributes."
