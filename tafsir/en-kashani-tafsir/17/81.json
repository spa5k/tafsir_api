  "text": "And say: 'The Truth has come, that is to say, the firm necessary existence that belongs to [God] the Truth, the one which cannot be changed or substituted, and falsehood has vanished away, that is to say, the contingent human existence that is subject to annihilation, change and disappearance. Truly falsehood, that is, contigent existence, is ever bound, to perish from the outset and [is] not something that is fixed and is exposed [by chance] to annihilation and thus perishes. Rather, what is evanescent is evanescent from pre-eternity and what is ever-subsisting is ever-subsisting and does not disappear. It is that we have veiled ourselves by a false and corrupt illusion which has been removed."
