  "text": "[it is] only, simply a tremendous mercy specific to you from Our extreme solicitude [of you], that which is the highest of the levels of the Merciful's mercy, charged by God, exalted be He, with the effusion of complete perfection upon him [the Prophet]. In other words, were We to disclose Ourself in Our Essence, you would not find revelation, nor your essence, unless We disclosed Ourself in the attribute of Mercy and Our Name the Merciful, in which case it [your existence] would be and you would find revelation. Likewise if We were to disclose Ourself in the attribute of Majesty, you would be veiled from revelation and gnosis. Truly His favour, through revelation and Lordly instruction after the bestowal of existence derived from [Him] the Truth, is ever great to you, from pre-eternity."
