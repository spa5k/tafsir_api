  "text": "And that those who do not believe, from among the people of the left, in the Hereafter, by virtue of their being corporeal folk, veiled from the world of light and imprisoned in the darknesses of physical nature, We have prepared for them a painful chastisement, in the pit of the dungeon of physical nature, fettered in the chains of the love of lower things and in the shackles of attachments, in the fires of privation from pleasures and passionate desires, chastised by the scorpions and snakes of the configurations of darkness."
