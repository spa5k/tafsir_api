  "text": "The day when We shall summon, to the end of this [verse], that is [the day when] We bring present, every, party of [every] community together with their witness who is present with them and to whom they orient themselves in terms of their perfection and whom they know, whether he be in the form of a prophet in whom they believed, as mentioned in the interpretation of His words So how shall it be when We bring forward from every community a witness [Q. 4:41], or [in the form of] an imam whose example they followed, or a religion or a book or whatever you will, provided that the [particle] bi is taken to mean 'with'. Or [it is that] We attribute them to their imam and summon them by his name, since he prevails over them and over their affair, their love of whom stands high over their love of anything else. And whoever is given his book in his right hand, that is, from the side of the intellect, which is the stronger of the person's sides, and is sent forth in the form of the felicitous, those will read their book, unlike others, by virtue of their preparedness for reading and understanding, since the one who is given his book in his left hand, that is, from the side of the soul, which is the weaker of the two sides, will not be able to read his book, even if it is readable, because his mind is lost and is utterly bewildered, and they will not be wronged, that is, they will not have anything of the forms of their deeds, their perfections and character traits diminished, not [even] by a small amount."
