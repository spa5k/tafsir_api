  "text": "With the truth have We revealed it: in other words, We only revealed the QurÌān after the total elimination of the Prophet's humanness, blessings and peace be upon him, at the station of annihilation and extinction of temporally originated beings from the face of eternity, and [only after] the scattering of the darkness of contingency from the august glories of the Necessary Subsisting Face at the second separation so that there might be an existential locus for it [the QurÌān]. Hence its revelation was only the manifestation of the judgements of differentiations from the source of union upon the differentiated locus of manifestation. Thus its revelation was with the truth from the Truth upon the Truth. Its revelation with the truth, according to this interpretation, is like when they say 'it came down to [stop over at] such and such [a place]' meaning 'he stopped over there', provided that the second [preposition] bi is adverbial, as when you say 'I stopped over in Baghdad', with the first [bi] being a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, that [it was revealed] fully garbed in the truth, meaning one of two things: either with the truth, as in the opposite of falsehood, that is to say, with the facts [of reality] and wisdom, or with the Truth who is God, exalted be He; in other words, that it was revealed with His attribute, which is the truth;"
