  "text": "And their Lord will pour for them a pure wine. Whoever does not have the wine of love today will not have the pure wine tomorrow. Today they swallow down the wine of love from the cup of recognition, tomorrow they drink the pure wine in the presence of the Forgiving King-today the wine of love in the paradise of recognition, tomor- row the pure wine in the paradise of approval. Today the paradise of recognition is the heart of the recognizers. Its walls are faith and sub- mission, its floor self-purification and recognition, its trees glorification and reciting the formula of tawḤīd, its rivers godwariness and trust, its abodes and palaces knowledge and abstinence, its rooms and views truthfulness and certainty, its approval approval of the decree. Today when someone has adorned the paradise of his heart with obedience and worship, tomorrow he will have the paradise of approval. The walls of that paradise are silver and gold, the floor ruby and emerald, the soil musk and ambergris, and the rivers water, milk, wine, and honey. The wine is Tasnīm [83:27], fine wine [83:25], and Salsabīl [76:18], the food the flesh of birds [56:21] on the table of everlastingness, the servants the serving boys and slaves, the sympathizers houris and wide- eyed maidens, the kind companions MuḤammad and Abraham, the comrades Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, ʿUthmān, and ʿAlī. The sitting place will be goodly dwellings [9:72] and the gazing place the seat of truthfulness [54:55]. The Palisades of Holiness will be the place of seeing the Real's majesty and beauty. Tomorrow all the faithful will see the Real, but each in the measure of his own recognition. “God discloses Himself to the faithful generally and to Abū Bakr specifically.” Since no one has the recognition of Abū Bakr, no one will share with him in that vision. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “What sort of pleasure is there in shared seeing? There must be a session empty of the intrusion of others, the Friend disclosing Himself and the gazer annihilated in what is seen. The eye that gazes on Him is never shut, the eye that sees Him has no partner. The one called by Him is never unfortunate, the one brought near to Him has no place in the two worlds, the one made His companion has no need for paradise, the one drunk with Him has only Him to pour: And their Lord will pour for them a pure wine.”"
