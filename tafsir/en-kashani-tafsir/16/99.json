  "text": "Indeed he has power over those who believe - its least degrees is cognitive certainty whose locus is the pure heart; but this certainty is not enough to preclude his [Satan's] power unless it is joined with the presential vision of the acts, which is the station of trust, as God, exalted be He, says: and who put their trust in their Lord. Annihilation in the acts is not possible while the attributes of the soul subsist, since the subsistence of its attributes necessitates [the subsistence of] its acts. That is why it is said that it is not possible to fulfil the due of a station, to certify it and consolidate it except after rising to the one above it. Thus by rising to the station of the attributes, the acts are annihilated and thus [the station of] trust becomes valid."
