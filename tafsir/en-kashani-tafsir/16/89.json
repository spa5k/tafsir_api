  "text": "and We shall bring you as a witness against these: this has already been mentioned in sūrat al-NisāÌ. And We have revealed to you the Book, namely, the Discriminating Intellect after the existence that is bestowed by the Truth, as a clarification of all things, explaining and verifying the truth of all things, and as a guidance to his perfection for whoever submits and yields to the soundness of his primordial nature, and a mercy, for him by making him attain that perfection by means of [spiritual] nurturing and reinforcement, and as good tidings to him that he will subsist in that perfection forever beyond time in the three gardens."
