  "text": "And verily there came to them a messenger from among them, that is, of their own genus, being the faculty of reflection which belongs with the totality of the soul's faculties, with rational concepts and truthful opinions, but they denied him, by failing to be affected thereby and to obey its commands and prohibitions, both the rational ones and those of the Law, and by refraining from conducting themselves according to its requirements and by being little concerned therewith and not caring in the slightest to turn their attention away from that in which they were engrossed, and so, the chastisement of being veiled and deprived from the pleasure of perfection, seized them, while they were unjust and deviating from the path of virtue and failing to fulfill the dues of their companion [the messenger]."
