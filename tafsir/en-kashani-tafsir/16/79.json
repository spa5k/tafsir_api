  "text": "Have they not observed the birds, the spiritual and ego-centric faculties such as reflection and the intellect, both the considerative and the practical, nay indeed, estimation and imagination, [how they are] made subservient in the air of heaven·∏ç, that is, [in] the space of the world of spirits. Nothing holds them, without attachment to substrata and without dependence on some heavy body, except God."
