  "text": "That, opening up of the breast to unbelief and contentment with it, is because they have preferred the life of this world to the Hereafter, since it constitutes the limit and ultimate extent of their knowledge and their knowledge does not extend to the Hereafter because the insights of their hearts are blocked and their preparedness corresponds to the dark lower matters such as corporeal substrata and so they have come to love what they can sense and this suits their state, even though the love of this world is the source of every sin as that [love] necessitates the thick veil behind which and in the folds of which lies all sin, and because God does not guide the disbelieving folk, that is, those who are veiled by the thickest veils since it is impossible for them to receive guidance."
