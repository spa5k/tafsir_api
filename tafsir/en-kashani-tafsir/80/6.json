  "text": "As for him who deemed himself without need, to him dost thou attend. “This man has shown himself to have no need for Me and worshiped another in place of Me, and he is deluded by his wealth and blessings: He reckons that his wealth will make him last forever [104:3]. He fancies that the property will keep him in this world forever. He does not know that the wealth is the cause of his punishment and increase in his chastisement.” One of the great ones of the religion said, “Gold, silver, and the various sorts of wealth are not this world itself, but the vessels and containers of this world. In the same way, the servant's movements and stillnesses and his acts of obedience are not the religion itself, but the vessels and containers of the religion. Religion is all burning and pain, and this world is all remorse and cold wind. All the gold, silver, and sorts of wealth that belonged to Korah were not reprehensible. But, when the rightful due of the Real was sought from him, he refused and would not discharge it. The pull of his heart toward gold, silver, and the wealth of this world was reprehensible. “There is many a person who has not seen a penny in his dreams but who tomorrow will be the Pharaoh of the folk of this world, for his heart is defiled by avarice for this world. And there is many a person who has been given possession of the wealth of this world who tomorrow will give back his heart without any apparent scar from this world.” The final end of a man who keeps the religion and lets go of this world is what He says at the end of the surah:"
