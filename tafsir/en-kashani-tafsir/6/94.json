  "text": "And now you have come to Us singly, disengaged from attributes, attachments, family, relations and existence by being absorbed in the source of the Essential union, as We created you the first time, by producing the atoms of your ipseities in pre-eternity at the taking of the covenant [cf. Q. 7:172], and you have left what We conferred on you, of means, forms of knowledge and qualities of excellence, behind your backs; and We do not see with you, your means, your causes and what you preferred by your caprices and attached yourselves to of your beloved things and your objects of worship, whom you claimed to be associates amongst you, out of your love for them and your devotion to them and your ascribing of [the power of] effect to them, and your heeding of them and equipping of yourselves with them. Now that separation has befallen you as a result of the mutation of states and the changing of forms and figures, and that which you claimed, as a thing possessing existence, has failed you, by your witnessing: [this statement] constituting universal laudation of God."
