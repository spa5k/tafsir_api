  "text": "Messengers indeed have been denied before you; yet they endured patiently, through God. He has given him solace through Himself after reprimanding him, lest he subsist within the variegation and so that he might not be sorry after it has departed from him and end up in [a state of] constriction, but rather so that his heart might be reassured, which is why He follows that with His words: There is none to change the words of God, that is, the attributes of God by which He discloses Himself to His servants. These are not replaced, nor are they changed by the denial of the deniers; nor are these [deniers] able to change [His attributes]. He then denies him any power and declares him as incapable with His words:"
