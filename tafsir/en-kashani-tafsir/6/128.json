  "text": "And, the day when He shall gather them, on the day of the source of the nondelimited union, all together, We shall say: 'O assembly, of the jinn of the ego-centric faculties, you have garnered much of mankind', that is, [much] of the senses and the external organs, or of the human forms, making them your adherents and the folk whom you obey and your seducing of them and adorning for them the ephemera of this world and corporeal pleasures and your evil whisperings to them to [commit] acts of disobedience. Then their friends from among mankind, who befriended them, will say, 'Our Lord, we enjoyed one another, by profiting each from the other in the form of the concentration (jam øiyya), but, verily, now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us', at death, or at the physical return in the vilest of forms and the most evil of living. He will say, 'The Fire, the fire of being deprived of pleasures and the finding of pain, is your lodging to abide therein' - except what, moment, God wills, that it be lessened or that from among you should be delivered he the cause of whose chastisement is not idolatrous association that had been firmly-rooted in his beliefs. Surely your Lord is Wise, not chastising you except for the configurations of your souls that you have acquired, commensurate with what is entailed by [His] wisdom, Knowing, of the one who is chastised for his beliefs and whose chastisement thus endures, or [who is chastised] for the configurations of his evil deeds and who is thus chastised in the measure commensurate with these [configurations] but is then delivered therefrom."
