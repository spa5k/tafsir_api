  "text": "And when a sign comes to them, in the way of an attribute of the heart, a luminous radiation from an angelic character configuration, or knowledge, wisdom and an effusion from a spirit, they deny them by turning away therefrom and [instead], from the part of the estimation and the imagination, they wish for perceptions similar to those intellective and reflective perceptions, and [desire] imaginary compositions and estimative fallacies with which to oppose the veridical proofs in order to believe in them and to yield thereto. God knows best where to place His Message, placing it only where it belongs among the spiritual faculties that are disengaged from primordial substrata. Those who have sinned, by being veiled and plotting to lead astray those who have prepared themselves to be guided, or [those] who pure hearts that have become guided, shall be smitten with humiliation from God, by the elimination of their capacities and their empowerment at the disintegration of the body, and a terrible chastisement, by depriving them of what is favourable for them and the procurement [to them] of what is incompatible for them at the physical resurrection in return for their plotting."
