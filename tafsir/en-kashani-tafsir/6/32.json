  "text": "The life of this world, that is, the sensory life - since what is sensory is closer to creatures than what is intelligible - is nothing but a game, nothing but something without foundation or reality, quick to perish and become extinct; surely the abode of the Hereafter, that is, the world of spiritual beings, is better for those who, disengage from the vestments of the attributes of mortals and corporeal pleasures. What, do you not understand·∏ç, so as to prefer the nobler, the more wholesome to the viler, the lowlier that is perishing."
