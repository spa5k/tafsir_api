  "text": "They indeed are losers who, are veiled, who are deniers of the encounter with the Truth, until when, the minor resurrection, comes upon them, they are remorseful for being remiss about it, and they shall be bearing their loads, in the way of the burdens of attachment [to the material] and the acts arising from the love of corporeal things, as well as the evil consequences of misdeeds and the sins arising from the configurations of sensory things, on their backs: in other words, these [burdens] shall mount them and assume mastery over them, firmly rooted as these are in their souls, veiling them, causing them [to suffer] chastisement and impeding them from what they desire."
