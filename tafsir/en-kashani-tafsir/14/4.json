  "text": "And We have not sent any Messenger except with the tongue of his people, that is, with speech that corresponds with the state in which they are in, in accordance with their preparedness and commensurate with their intellects. For otherwise they would not understand, as that meaning would then be remote from their understanding and would not correspond with their station; and he would not be able to make clear for them the potential in their first preparedness in the way of perfection that befits it and what their ipseities entail according to primordial nature; God then sends astray whomever He will, because of the disappearance of that person's preparedness through dark configurations that have taken deep root [in him] and false beliefs that have settled [in him]; and He guides whomever He will, whomever has remained upon his preparedness, or in whom the veils of his configurations and the forms of his beliefs have not taken deep root; and He is the Mighty, the Strong whose will cannot be overcome and so He guides whomever He wishes to send astray and sends astray whomever He wishes to be guided; the Wise, who manages the affair of guiding the one to be guided by all manner of graces and the affair of the sending astray of the one to be sent astray by all manner of forsaking, as required by [His] ultimate wisdom."
