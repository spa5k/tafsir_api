  "text": "As your Lord brought you forth: in other words, this state, meaning, the state in which they are objecting to you, in terms of translocation, is like their objection when your Lord brought you forth [from your home], because they, having veiled themselves from the act of God with their acts, saw both acts as issuing from you and so were averse to your going forth just as they were averse to your being granted the spoils of war [by God]. Nor did they understand [the significance of] your Lord's bringing you forth, from your home with the truth, that is, garbed in the truth, going forth with it and not with your soul. In this way bi'l-á¸¥aqq ('with the truth') is a circumstantial qualifier of the direct object of [the verb] akhrajaka ('brough you forth'); or [it means] a going forth garbed in what is the correct action and wisdom."
