  "text": "When your Lord inspired the angels, [saying], 'I am with you: in other words, He was reinforcing the angelic realm (malakūt) with the realm of divine power (jabarūt), so that they would come to learn from the world of divine power that God was assisting them, so make those who believe, in the contiguous strengthening [from heaven], stand firm. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers, [and they experience terror] by virtue of the fact that they are severed from the heavenly reinforcement and divine strengthening and that doubt and the force of illusion have taken mastery over them, so smite above the necks: in other words, make them firm by instructing them in the meaning of this and encourage them by casting these words unto them, or by showing them this action on your part, as the reported narrative has it."
