  "text": "And it was said, 'O earth, swallow your waters, and O heaven, abate!': in other words, a call came from the direction of the Truth by the tongue of the Law [to] the earth of corporeal nature to the effect: O earth, by the command of the Law and by following its precepts diminish the power over you of your vain desire and its mastery by the gushing forth of your substrata over the heart and halt at the bounds of moderation through which it [the heart] acquires its proper condition; and O heaven of the intellect, veiled [as you are] by habit and sense, tarnished by illusion and overcast with the clouds of vain desire that reinforce the soul and physical nature by preparing for it its substrata and means [of nourishment] through consideration, desist from reinforcing it. And the waters, of corporeal nature and the lifeline of the moisture that screens off the light of the Truth and prevents real life, subsided. And the affair, of God, was accomplished, by the deliverance of those who were saved and the destruction of those who were destroyed, and it became steady, that is, his law was upheld, upon the Jūdī, of Noah's existence and it settled, and it was said: 'Away with, that is, destruction for, the evildoing folk!', who denied God's religion and worshipped vain desire instead of the truth and substituted the place of the Law with the path of nature."
