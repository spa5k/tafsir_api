  "text": "He said, 'O my people, have you considered, in other words, tell me: what if I might be [acting] upon, a proof of certitude regarding [my] affirmation of the Oneness, from my Lord and that He has provided me with fair sustenance from Himḍ, in the way of cognitive and practical wisdom, as well as perfectedness and perfection by means of uprightness in affirming the Oneness, would it be right for me to abandon my forbidding of idolatrous association and injustice, and my desire to set things right by cleansing and adorning you [with righteous deeds]ḍ The apodosis of araÌaytum ('have you considered') has been omitted because it has [already] been indicated in similar [passages], as the aforementioned stories of Noah and Ṣāliḥ, peace be upon them both, and [indicated] by the words here that are specific to him: And I do not desire to be inconsistent before you, to the end of this [verse]: that is, that I should seek to procure transient this-worldly benefits [for myself] by committing the very injustices which I am forbidding you. I desire only to, set my soul and your souls right by acts of self-cleansing and preparation for the reception of wisdom so far as I am able. And I am only successful in setting things right, through God. In Him I trust and to Him I turn [repentant]."
