  "text": "And Noah called out to his Lord and said, 'My Lord, lo! my son is of my family: fatherly compassion and the affectionate bonds of kinship drove him to demand his deliverance on account of the intensity of his attachment to him and concern for his affair. Despite that, he was mindful of the [refined] manners required in the [divine] presence and the virtuous [form of] requesting [from God], saying: and truly Your promise is the Truth, and he did not say, 'do not break Your promise to deliver my family'. And he said that [which he did say] only because of the presence of some variegation and a remnant within him, since by 'family' he had understood those related [to him] by form and natural ties of kinship, oblivious on account of his excessive distress for his son of God's proviso where He said: save those against whom the Word has already gone forth [Q. 11:40], failing to realise that his son is the one against whom the Words had already gone forth. Nor did he [Noah] solicit the compassion of his Lord, but alluded with his words: and You are the Most Just of Judges' to the fact that the Knower, the Just and the Wise does not break His promise."
