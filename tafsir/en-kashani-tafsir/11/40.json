  "text": "Such that when Our command came, for the destruction of your community, and the oven, of the body, overflowed, at the point of the mastery of the corrupt mixtures and the excretive moistures over the natural heat and [the mastery of] the natural potency of the primordial water over the fire of the animal spirit. Or [such that when there came] Our command for their spiritual destruction and the oven overflowed at the mastery of the water of natural vain desire over the heart and its drowning it in the primordial sea of the body. We said, 'Carry therein of every one two pairs, that is, from every kind of every species two, being their two forms, special and that of kind, which remain upon the annihilation of individuals. The meaning of the 'carrying of the two therein' is his knowledge of their subsistence with the subsistence of human spirits. For his knowledge is part of his all-subsuming ship, since it is composed of knowledge and deed. Thus its knowledge regarding the two is its carrying of the two and his knowledge concerning the two is his carrying of the two therein; and your family, and those who are joined to you in your religion and your conduct from among your kin, save those against whom the Word has already gone forth, that is, the judgement from pre-eternity that that one should be destroyed for his disbelief, and those who believe', in God from among your community."
