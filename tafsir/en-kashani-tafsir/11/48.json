  "text": "It was said, 'O Noah, go down, that is, descend from the locus of the union and the pinnacle of the station of sanctity and absorption in the unity to the station of differentiation and law-giving prophethood by returning to creation and witnessing the multiplicity at the source of unity, neither wrathful because of [your] being veiled by them [the multiplicity] from the Truth, nor satisfied with their disbelief by veiling [yourself] from them with the Truth, in peace, that is, safe from being veiled by the multiplicity and from the manifestation of the soul in wrath and from the existence of variegation and the actualisation of attachment after disengagement or error after guidance, from Us, that is, [a peace] issuing from Us and through Us, and blessings, as a result of the legislation of the rules of the Law and the establishing of the foundations of justice by means of which everything grows and is augmented, upon you and upon some communities, that will issue, from those with you, following your religion and your path until the end of time. And [there will be other] communities, that is, and there will issue forth from those with you communities, to whom We shall give enjoyment, in the life of this world, because of their veiling themselves therewith and halting [thereat], and then a painful chastisement will befall them', when We destroy them for their disbelief and burn them in the Fire of the vestiges and chastise them with the configurations.If you wish to effect a correspondence [between this and your own existence], you would interpret Noah as your spirit and the Ark as your cognitive and practical perfection through which shall be your salvation at the point of the Flooding of the sea of primordial matter, such that when the oven of the body overflows as a result of the mastery of alien moisture and corrupt mixtures and there comes the call [proclaiming] its [the body's] disintegration, he [your spirit] rides in it and carries with him [on board] from every two kinds from among the beasts of the animal and the natural faculties and the birds of the spiritual faculties two, that is, their original pair. And [he carries with him] his three sons, Ham (Ḥām) the heart, Shem (Sām) the considerative intellect and Japheth (Yāfith) the practical intellect as well as his wife, the reassured soul, taking it [the Ark] on its course in the Greatest Name of God and [finally] being delivered with timeless subsistence from eternal destruction in the Flood, while his other wife, the corporeal nature, and his son from her, the estimation that sought refuge in the mountain of the brain, are drowned."
