  "text": "[He said:] 'O my people, have you considered if I am [acting] upon a clear proof from my Lord: that it is incumbent upon you from the point of view of reason to submit to Him, and He has given me mercy, that is, special guidance through unveiling that is high above the degree of [rational] demonstration, from Him, that is, above the stage of intellect, being from the forms of knowledge that are God-given and from the station of prophethood, and it has been obscured from you, for your veiling of yourselves from the inward with the outward and from the Reality with creation. It can only be received through the volition of the folk of preparedness: how then can we compel you and coerce you to it, while you are averse to it·∏ç, in other words, if you wish to acquire acceptance of it, then cleanse your souls and purify your preparedness, if one has been bestowed on you, and abandon your denial so that the effect of the light of volition might be manifested upon you and you might then [be able to] receive it, God willing."
