Or [it sailed with them amid] waves of the deviations of the constitution and the overpowerings of ruinous mixtures. And Noah called out to his son, who was veiled by his intellect - that was [itself] overcome by illusion, being the intellect of livelihood - from the religion of his father and his affirmation of Oneness; who was [standing] in a place cut off, from his religion and his law: 'O my son, embark with us, that is, enter into our religion, and do not be with the disbelievers!, those who are veiled from the Truth and who will be destroyed by waves of the vain desires of the soul to drown in the sea of natural character traits."
