  "text": "And [bidding you]: 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord, in other words, proclaim His Oneness and ask of Him that He forgive the configurations of looking upon the other, the veiling of oneself with the multiplicity, confinement to things and halting with them even your acts and attributes; then repent to Him, return to Him by having [your] essences annihilated in Him, and He will give you fair enjoyment, in this world, on the basis of the divine law and justice in the case of subsistence after annihilation until the time of your reception at death, and He will give every person of merit, in terms of character traits, knowledge and perfections, [the due for] his merit, in the way of reward and degrees; or, He will give you fair enjoyment of the pleasures of the self-disclosures of the acts and the attributes, upon your disengagement, up to the moment of your annihilation; or, He gives every person of merit in terms of preparedness, [the due for] his merit in the way of perfection and level upon his elevation and drawing closer. But if you turn away, that is, refrain from affirmation of Oneness and disengagement, I fear for you the chastisement of an awful day, one [that will be] severe for you, the day of the return to God, the Powerful over all things, in other words, the day on which your incapacity and the incapacity of what you worshipp shall be manifested through His manifestation, exalted be He, in the attribute of His powerfulness whereupon He will subjugate you with chastisement."
