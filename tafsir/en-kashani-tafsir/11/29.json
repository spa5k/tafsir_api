I do not demand that of you, so be alerted to my [true] desire, if you are possessors of rational faculties as you claim; and I will not drive away those who believe, since they are people of propinquity and stature before God, and if I were to drive them away I would be an enemy of God and one in strife against His friends: I would not be a prophet in that case. But I see you are a people who are ignorant, of what makes a man fit for the encounter with God, knowing neither God nor the encounter with Him, because your intellects have taken flight to this world or because you are foolish, hurting the believers with your foolishness."
