As for the deliverance of Ṣāliḥ and those with them, according to the mentioned interpretation, this is like the deliverance of Jesus, peace be upon him, from crucifixion, as related in His words And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but for them he was given the resemblance [Q. 4:157] and His words and they did not slay him for certain. Nay, God raised him up to Him [Q. 4:157-8], similar to the deliverance of the believing man from among Pharaoh's folk [cf. Q. 40:28], according to what He has alluded to in His words So God shielded him from the evils of what they had plotted [Q. 40:45]."
