  "text": "Truly I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord; there is no creature, but He takes it by the forelock: he makes clear the necessity of trusting in God and that this [trust] is a fortified citadel, firstly by that His Lordship subsumes all and the one who is lord over another manages his affair and preserves him such that he has no need of the protection or guardianship of another; then by that every soul-possessing individual is subject to His vanquishing power and authority, captive in His disposing hand, His dominion and His power, unable to act, without power over or effect upon another and immobile in himself, like the dead, and as such there is no need to guard oneself or seek protection against him; then by that He is, on a straight path, that is, on the path of justice in the world of multiplicity, which is the shadow of His unity, and consequently He does not give anyone warrant over another except when that person deserves it on account of some sin or crime. Nor does He punish anyone unless he has slipped, even if it should be a minor [slip]; but such [punishment where it is due] might be for the purpose of cleansing [that person] and raising [him] by a degree as in the case of [the degree of] witnessing. In addition, within all of that he denies them and their deities the power to bring benefit or harm."
