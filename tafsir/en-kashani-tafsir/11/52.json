  "text": "And, O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, for the sins of the soul's veils and for halting with vain desire in idolatrous association, then turn to Him repentant, by orienting yourselves to the affirmation of Oneness and to the wayfaring along His path through disengagement and illumination, and He will release the sky of the spirit, upon you in abundance, with the waters of true knowledge and gnoses of certainty, and He will add to you, the strength of perfection, to, the strength of preparedness. And do not turn away from Him, as sinners', by manifesting the attributes of your souls and orienting yourselves to the lower aspect through the love of this world and the pursuit of nature."
