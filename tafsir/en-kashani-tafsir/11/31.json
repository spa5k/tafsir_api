Nor do I say, to the poor believers whom you scorn and regard with the eye of disdain, that God will not give them any good, as you claim, because for me 'good' is that which is with God and not property - God knows better, than me and you, what is in their souls, of good. He is best acquainted with their capacities and thoughts and none [except Him] knows the measure of their goodness, because it is tremendous. Lo! then I, that is, if I were to deny [any association of] good with them or drive them away, would be of the evildoers indeed'."
