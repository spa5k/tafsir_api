For the substations (daqāÌiq) of the sins of their states are too fine to be perceived by the intellect and their punishment too severe to be estimated by illusion; and you will have, then, besides God, no protectors, to guard you from His punishment, govern your affairs or nurture you, and then you will not be helped, against His might: this is a threat for His friends. How [much worse] then [would it be] for His enemiesḍ"
