In this meaning, someone composed a poem: My covenant is not because of love for earthly dust, but for that in which the Beloved dwells. * What I want from Your street is Your face. The word at has the stamp of proximity and election: “In the abode of the decree We gave this robe of proximity, eminence, and rank to MuṣṬafā the Arab, as he said: 'I spend the night at my Lord.' Tomorrow We will place this same robe and rank next to the faithful in the measure of their travel- ing, for they will be in a seat of truthfulness, at an Omnipotent King.” ṣāliḤ ibn Ḥayyān narrated from ʿAbdallāh ibn Barīda a saying concerning His words, in a seat of truthfulness, at an Omnipotent King: “The folk of the Garden will enter in upon the Compeller twice a day and recite for Him the Qur'an. Each man among them will sit in his own sitting place, on a pulpit of pearls, rubies, emeralds, gold, and silver, in accordance with their deeds. Their eyes will never be so delighted as they are by this. They will never have heard anything more tre- mendous and more beautiful. Then they will turn back to their lodging places, blissful, their eyes delighted, until the like of it on the morrow.”"
