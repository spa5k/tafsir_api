  "text": "Whoever desires the reward of this world, satisfied to remain with the caprice of the soul: why does such a one seek the vilest of things and remain at the lowest levels·∏ç then God has the reward, of both abodes at once, if he should desire it [the reward of this world] by being annihilated in it, for He is the Existence that encompasses everything and nothing escapes Him. God is ever Hearer, of the conversations of your souls, Seer, of what your intentions and desires are in your deeds."
