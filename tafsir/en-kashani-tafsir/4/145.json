  "text": "[Verily, the hypocrites will be] in the lowest level [of the Fire], on account of his increased chastisement, the severity of his torture and burning, and not on account of its being the lowest level, for the effect of the Fire on the hypocrite is more severe and more painful given that there is a remnant of preparedness in him. As for the original bovine disbeliever, because of the lack of any preparedness in him does not suffer in his chastisement the pain which the hypocrite suffers, even if he should be in a worse state than him and endure a greater chastisement and degradation; [and you will never find for them] a helper, to help them from God's chastisement, because both their connection and the raising of their love [to God] together with [that of] the folk of God are severed [from them]."
