  "text": "Those who disbelieve, [those] who veil themselves from the Truth and from religion, and from the union and from differentiation, and seek to divide between God and His messengers, by veiling themselves from religion but not the Truth and from differentiation but not the union, and so deny the messengers estimating that unity is incompatible with multiplicity and that union is inconsistent with differentiation: that is how they end up believing in some things and disbelieving in others: [and say, 'We believe in some, and disbelieve in some'] and seek to adopt, a way between total faith, in union and differentiation, and total disbelief."
