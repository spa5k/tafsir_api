  "text": "And those who expend of their substance to show off to people, that is, who manifest their perfections from the concealment of non-existence and bring them out into actuality, veiled by their seeing these as being of their own souls and make a show to people that these [perfections] are theirs, and believe not in God, with true belief so that they might know that absolute perfection can only be His - what existence does anything other than Him possess so that such [perfection] might belong to it·∏ç - and that they might be rid of the veil of seeing perfection as that of their souls and might thus be delivered from the sin of vanity; and the Last Day, that is, the annihilation in God and the issuing forth before the One, the Vanquisher, that they might thus be quit of the sin of associating [others with God]. And that is because of their comradeship with the satan of estimation. Whoever has Satan for a comrade, then an evil comrade has he, because he [Satan] leads him astray from guidance and veils him from the Truth."
