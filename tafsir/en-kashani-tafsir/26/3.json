  "text": "Perhaps thou tormentest thyself because they are not of the faithful. He is saying, “O master, they are a handful of the estranged, the objects of My harsh and forceful severity. Why do you occupy your heart with them? Why do you make yourself suffer because they will not believe? Turn them over to My decree and busy your heart with My love and com- panionship. Whenever a heart takes its ease in My love and companionship, it has no room for any other.” Sahl ʿAlī Marwazī was asked, “What is the greatest of God's generous gifts to the servant?” He said, “That He empty his heart of everyone but Him.” Junayd was asked, “When is the heart happy?” He said, “When He is inside the heart.” Shaykh al-Islām said, “He is not in the heart by His Essence. Rather the remembrance of Him is in the heart, love for Him in the secret core, and gazing upon Him in the spirit. In contemplation there is first the heart's vision, then the heart's proximity, then the heart's finding, then the heart's seeing face-to-face, then proximity's mastery over the heart, then the heart's dissolution in face-to- face vision. Beyond that, nothing can be expressed.” I set off on the oceans of love not knowing their measure- oceans that do not quench the fire of those who drown."
