  "text": "But as for him who believes, by means of knowledge and gnosis, like the two rational faculties, as well as reflection and the external sensoria, and acts righteously, by hastening to acquire qualities of excellence and by yielding and being obedient, he shall have, as a reward, the fairest thing, in the way of the Garden of the attributes and the self-disclosures of Its lights along with Its rivers of knowledge; and we shall speak to him mildly in our command', that is to say, a gentle speech by the actualisation of excellent habitus (malaka)."
