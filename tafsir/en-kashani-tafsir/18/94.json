  "text": "They said, by the tongue of [their] state, 'Truly Gog, the exigencies and estimative murmurings, and Magog, the whisperings and imaginative tendencies, are causing corruption in the land, of the body by inciting to vices and passionate desires that violate order and [by] urging to works that result in its impairment and the ruining of the rules that regulate good-doing and the bases of wisdom and [result] in the bringing about of vicissitudes, temptations, vain desires, and innovations [all of] which conflict with justice and necessarily bring about the corruption of crops and offspring. So shall we pay you a tribute, by reinforcing you with our perfections and the forms of our perceptibles, on condition that you build between us and them a dam·∏ç, which they cannot traverse and a barrier which they cannot scale, being the legal limit and the veil of the heart in terms of practical wisdom."
