Qatāda said, 'These are the words spoken by the People of the Book and completing where they had said They will say \ufffd [Q. 18:22]. And His words Say: 'God is more knowledgeable\ufffd' is a refutation of them. In the codex (muṣḥaf) of ʿAbd Allāh [b. Masʿūd] it is: And they said that they had tarried (wa-qālū labithū), that is because there is no verifiable or unvarying certainty [regarding the exact duration]."
