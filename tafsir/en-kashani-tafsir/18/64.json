  "text": "Said he, 'That, in other words, that escape of the fish and its making its way in accordance with its innate disposition (jibilla), is what we have been, seeking. Because there can be found the juncture of the two seas where Moses had been promised that he would find someone more knowledgeable than him. For the ascent to perfection by close pursuit of the holy intellect can only be at such a station. So they turned back, retracing their footsteps, in rising to the station of the first primordial nature (fiṭra ūlā) as they had initially been retracing their footsteps at the descent from the ascent to perfection until they found the holy intellect which is one of God's servants singled out for the privilege of [divine] solicitude and mercy."
