'Verily you have come to Us: We say to them on that Day, 'you have come to Us, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised and each on his own, in other words, just as We created you the first time; rather you claimed, by your denial of the resurrection, that We would not appoint for you a tryst', a moment for the fulfilment of what you were promised by the tongues of prophets in the way of a sending forth [after death] and a resurrection."
