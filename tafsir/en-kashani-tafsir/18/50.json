  "text": "The signification of the prostration of the angels and Iblīs's refusal has already been mentioned. As for His words, He [Iblīs] was one of the jinn, [syntactically] constitutes incipient speech, as though someone had said, 'What was wrong with Iblīs that he did not prostrate himselfḍ', to which the reply is, 'He was one of the jinn', that is, [he was] one of those corporeal faculties that are concealed in matter, and that is why he transgressed, against his Lord's command, in other words, on account of his veiling himself with matter and its appendages."
