  "text": "[Those, for them there shall be] Gardens of Eden, in the way of the three Gardens; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold: that is, they shall be made ornate therein with different kinds of adornments in the way of the realities of the affirmation of the oneness of the Essence and the meanings of the entified self-disclosures of the Exclusive Unity (aá¸¥adiyya). For, the gold adornments constitute the entifications, whereas the silver ones constitute the luminous ones of the [divine] attributes, as in where He says: and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver [Q. 76:21]; and they shall wear green garments: they shall resplendent, virtuous and radiant attributes that shall necessarily bring about joy; of fine silk: of states and bestowals, since these are subtler; and [heavy] silk brocade: of character traits and earnings, since these are denser, reclining therein on, the couches that are the divine names, which are the points of origin for His acts, on account of their having assumed His attributes and of the fact that the attribute together with the Essence is precisely what that [divine] name is supported by in the Garden of attributes and acts. How excellent a reward, and how fair a resting-place!, in contrast with How evil a drink and how ill a resting-place [Q. 18:29]."
