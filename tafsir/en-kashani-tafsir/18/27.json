  "text": "And recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord: it is possible that the min ('of the Book') denotes inceptiveness of purpose, such that the Book is First Tablet that comprehends all forms of knowledge from which revelation was given to those to whom it was revealed. Or it [the min] could be an explication of what has been revealed, with the Book denoting the Discriminating Intellect in both cases. There is none who can change His words, which are the principles of religion such as the affirmation of oneness and justice and various other such [principles]. And you will not find, besides Him, any refuge, to incline to, since such a thing cannot exist."
