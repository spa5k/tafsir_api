  "text": "And restrain yourself: a command to exercise patience with God and His folk and not to turn your attention to other than Him - this patience is the kind indicative of uprightness and fixity and can only be [realised] through God - along with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening, in other words, continuously, being the affirmers of His oneness the disengaged indigent ones who seek nothing other than God and have no want of either this world or the Hereafter and who do halt with any acts or attributes, desiring His Countenance, namely, only His essence, calling on Him and not being veiled from Him by other than Him at the moment of the manifestation this [essence] at the daybreak of annihilation or at the moment of Its being veiled by them at subsistence. And so patience with them is patience with God, and the overlooking of them with the eye, which is forbidden, constitutes the turning of one's attention to what is other [than God]."
