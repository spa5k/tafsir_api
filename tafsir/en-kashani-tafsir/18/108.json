  "text": "[wherein they will abide] with no desire to be removed from them, [with no desire for] any self-transmutation (taḥawwul) since they will have attained perfection which their preparedness had entailed and so there will be no yearning for what might be beyond these [Gardens], even if there should be [another] perfection beyond that since they will have no perception thereof, and so neither tasting nor yearning [will they have beyond the Gardens]. The fact that they are the opposite of the polytheists who are veiled from the Truth by the other and the fact that their Gardens are the Gardens of Paradise (firdaws) both prove that the ones intended [here in the verse] are the affirmers of the Oneness (muwaḥḥidūn) of perfected preparedness, above whose perfection there is no other perfection and so there is nothing remaining beyond their rank which they would want to 'change' to."
