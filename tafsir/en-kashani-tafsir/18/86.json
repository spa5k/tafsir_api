  "text": "until, when he reached the setting of the sun, that is, the setting of the sun of the spirit, he found it setting in a muddy spring, namely, one that was mixed with mud, which is the corporeal matter, an admixture of dark bodies, similar to where He says from a drop of mixed fluid [Q. 76:2]; and he found by it a folk, namely, the egocentric faculties, the corporeal and the spiritual. We said, 'O DhūÌl-Qarnayn - either chastise, by means of spiritual discipline, subjugation and bringing to death, or treat them kindly', by setting them straight and fulfilling their share."
