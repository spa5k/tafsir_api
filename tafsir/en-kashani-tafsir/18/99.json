In other words, We shall leave them to mix on account of their coming together in the spirit without separation, and the Trumpet shall be blown, for the sending forth [from death] at the second creation, and We shall gather them a [single] gathering: or at the major resurrection, in the state of annihilation. The manifestation of the Truth which levels it because of the high stature of knowledge and wisdom there. The manifestation of the signification of the dissolution and licitness [granted by God] is by the self-disclosure of the divine acts and the nonexistence of the other and His act And on that day, We shall let some of them surge against others bewildered mixing as one thing without movement. And the Trumpet shall be blown by the existentiation through the existence of [God] the Truth at the state of subsistence and We shall gather them a [single] gathering in the [reality of the] Oneness, uprightness and fixity, and in the fact that they will be in God and not in themselves."
