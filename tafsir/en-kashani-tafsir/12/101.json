  "text": "My Lord, indeed You have given me [something] of sovereignty, that is, of the Oneness of sovereignty which is the Oneness of the acts, and You have taught me the interpretation of events, that is, the meanings of things hidden in the Unseen and what a [given] form of the Unseen ultimately refers to, something which belongs to the affirmation of the Oneness of the attributes, Originator, of the heavens of the attributes at the station of the heart and [of] the earth of the affirmation of the Oneness of the acts at the station of the soul. You are my Protector, in the affirmation of the Oneness of the Essence in this world of the sovereignty and the Hereafter of the spiritual [angelic] realm. Receive me in death in submission [to You]: annihilate me from myself in a state of being obedient to Your command and not insolent as a result of the subsisting of [my] ego, and join me to the righteous', who are firmly fixed at the station of uprightness after being annihilated in the affirmation of Oneness."
