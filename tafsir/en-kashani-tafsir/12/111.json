  "text": "Verily there is in their stories a crossing over [moral] for people of pith, that is, [a moral] by which they can cross over from the exoteric aspect of these [stories] to their esoteric one, in the way that We provided a [spiritual] crossing over in the story of Joseph for the possessors of intellects that are stripped of the skin of illusory things, unadulterated with the coverings of sensory things. It, this QurÌān, is not a discourse that has been fabricated, by the soul, but a confirmation of what, was fixed beforehand in the Tablet, and a detailing of everything, that is undifferentiated in the world of [divine] decree and a guidance to the affirmation of Oneness, and a mercy, by means of the self-disclosures of the attributes from behind the curtains of His verses, for a folk who believe, in the Unseen by virtue of the purity of their preparedness."
