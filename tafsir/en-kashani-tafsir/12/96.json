  "text": "As for his saying, 'Did I not say to you, \ufffdIndeed I know from God what you do not know·∏ç\ufffd, this is an allusion to his prior knowledge of the heart's return to the station of the intellect.His asking of forgiveness for them is his establishing of them upon the judgement of the intellectual virtues by means of uprightness after their purification, their acquisition of intelligence and their reception of luminous configurations after shedding the dark ones. Their entry upon Joseph is their arrival at the station of the breast at the point of uprightness. Their entry into Egypt is the being of all in the presence of the divine concentration of the [inclusive] unity despite the variance in their levels of excellence at the source of the union of the unity. The raising of his parents upon the throne represents the elevation of the two levels of the intellect and the soul over the levels of the remaining faculties and the increase in their propinquity to him and the potency of their authority over these [other faculties]. Their falling down in prostration before him represents the submission of all and their obedience to him by the command of the divine [inclusive] unity without their souls' exercising any motion, such that not a single hair or vein moves in them except by means of God."
