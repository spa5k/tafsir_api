Know also that for those beloved [of God] their unveilings precede their [spiritual] efforts. Thus they teach their faculties the divine precepts and rulings and direct them after the arrival, even if their souls should be reassured before that [arrival]. As for the provision with which he equipped them is a small measure of particulars which they are able to comprehend and work with."
