  "text": "Until when the messengers despaired, that is, [until when] they have journeyed and guarded themselves and their conquest and victory over unveilings slackened by the disbelief of the faculties of the soul, until when the messengers, those who are the noble leaders of the people, despaired of attaining perfection, and thought that, their suppositions had deceived them in terms of their preparedness for perfection or their hopes, Our help came to them, in the way of reinforcement and the granting of success by the replenishing [of them] with the lights of the angelic realm and the realm of invincibility, and whomever We wished We delivered, of those messengers and their followers belonging to the folk of [God's] solicitude. And, Our vanquishing by means of veils and chastisement, cannot be averted from the sinning folk, when We make manifest upon their hearts the attributes of their souls so that they then cause them [their hearts] to acquire wicked configurations that veil and harm [them]."
