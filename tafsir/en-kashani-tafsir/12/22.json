However, most people are not aware that such matters are [completely] in the hands of God and so they press on to [spiritual] striving, struggling and training unaware that the striving, the struggling, the training and the spiritual discipline are also [all] from God. God has made these causes and means for what He has predetermined and that is why He has not separated them by saying, after stating We gave him [power of] judgement and knowledge: Thus, We reward those who are virtuous, in [their] pursuit, will, struggle and spiritual discipline."
