  "text": "And the ʿAzīz's wife, the one called Zulaykhā, to whom he entrusted his [the heart's] welfare with his statement, 'Give him an honourable place. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son', is the very self-reproaching soul which sought illumination by the light of the spirit, the vestige of which reached it, but which failed to attain fixity (tamkīn) therewith and did not attain the degree of the reassured soul. God's establishing of him [Joseph] in the land constitutes His empowering of him, after the cleansing and being illuminated by the light of the spirit, to [be able to] resist the soul and the faculties, and His granting of him mastery over the land of the body by the use of his instruments in the actualisation of perfections and in the governance of it by means of acts of [spiritual] discipline until such time as that [potential] perfection which resides in his preparedness emerges into actuality, as He says, that We might teach him the interpretation of events, in other words, that We might teach him about Our act, what We did with him in the way of delivering [him] and empowering [him] with fixity. And God's way [always] prevails, through His reinforcement, His facilitating of success and assistance until such time as he reaches the full extent of the perfection of his prime at the station which his preparedness entails so that He might then endow him with knowledge and wisdom, as He says:"
