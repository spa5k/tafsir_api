  "text": "As for the courtiers who said, 'A jumble of dreams!, those were the noble faculties, such as the intellect, the reflection that is veiled by estimation, and estimation itself that is veiled from the mystery of spiritual discipline and from [that of] change, as in the case of those who are veiled by these [faculties] and who have halted with them, whom you find reckoning the states of folk who practice spiritual discipline to be [mere] fairytales. As for the messenger of love who 'remembered after a time', he only remembered by means of the manifestation of the angel of the Holy Spirit and the latter's inspiration to him and causing him to see the differentiations of his existence by returning to the multiplicity after the unity - otherwise he would be in the state of annihilation, consumed by the source of the union, seeing therein neither the existence of the heart nor anything else: how then would he be able to remember·∏ç He would only remember as a result of his becoming manifested by the light of the Truth after his non-existence."
