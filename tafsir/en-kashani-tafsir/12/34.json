  "text": "So his Lord answered him, and He fended off their wiles from him, that is, He reinforced him with holy support and fortified him with castings from the august glories, turning his face away from the side of abomination to the side of the Holy, fending off thereby their machinations. Truly He is the Hearer, of the heart's communion at the station of mystery, the Knower, of what ought to be done with it when it is in need of Him."
