  "text": "You will not be disablers in earth or in heaven, and you have no friend or helper apart from God. You will not be disablers in earth or in heaven. On the contrary, everything turns around in His grasp, and He brings to pass for them the decrees of His predetermination-whether they deny or voice His tawḤīd, whether they turn toward Him or away from Him."
