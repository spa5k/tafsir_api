  "text": "You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty from your Lord, that is, do not have any inhibitions, upon your return to mutiplicity, about seeking gentle comforts for your souls and giving them the enjoyment of their shares [of this world] in accordance with the Law and as permitted by the Truth, for [the fulfilment of] their shares thus would reinforce their being in harmony with the heart in its pursuit of its goals and because they would not then be transgressors illumined as they would be by the light of the Truth; but when you press on, that is, when you push your souls forward [from ʿArafāt], from the station of complete gnosis, which is the last of the holy rites of the Pilgrimage and the mother of them all, as the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, \" The Pilgrimage is essentially ʿArafa \" ; then remember God at the Sacred Waymark, that is, witness God's beauty at the spiritual mystery that is called the Hidden (al-khafiyy), for remembrance at this station is to witness, while the sacred waymark is the locus for sensing the beauty which the other is forbidden from reaching; and remember Him as He has guided you, to remembrance of Him at the [various] levels. For He, exalted be He, has guided [you] first to remembrance by the tongue, which is the remembrance of the soul, then to the remembrance by the heart which is is the remembrance of the acts, [remembrance] from which issue forth the graces and favours of God, then to the remembrance of the innermost heart which is the eyewitnessing of the acts and the unveiling of the sciences of the disclosures of the attributes, then to the remembrance of the spirit which is the witnessing of the lights of the disclosures of the attributes together with the observing of the light of the Essence, then to the remembrance of the Hidden which is the witnessing of the beauty of the Essence together with the subsistence of the duality [ḍ], then to the remembrance of the essence which is the witnessing of the essence through the lifting of the subsistence, though previously, that is, before your arrival and stand at the ʿArafāt of gnosis, you were misguided, [away] from these remembrances."
