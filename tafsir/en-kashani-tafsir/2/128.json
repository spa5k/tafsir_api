And make us submissive to You, that is, do not assign us to our own selves so that we might submit by our selves, but [that] we should submit [to You] through You and by Your making; [and, of our seed, a community submissive to You; and show us our holy rites, and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting, the Merciful.]"
