  "text": "Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that We have revealed, that is, [those] who conceal what We have effused upon them of the clear proofs of the lights of gnoses and the knowledge of the self-disclosures of the acts and the attributes and the guidance of the states and the stations, or the guidance to the affirmation of the Unity of the Essence via certain knowledge. For what is eyewitnessed cannot be concealed by means of variegations of the soul or the heart, [variegations] that mask the unveilings in the heart and the mysterious communions of the night and the spiritual witnessings, after We have shown them to the people clearly [in the Scripture], in the Book of their intellects, [intellects] illumined by the light of the pursuit that perceives the vestiges of the lights of the hearts and the spirits with the blessing of companionship - they shall be cursed by God, He will reject them and banish them, and by the cursers, from among the High Council, [who curse them] by forsaking them and refraining from reinforcing them from the world of support and light, and [by the cursers] from among the yearning prepared ones, the light of whose hearts they [the now accursed] had enjoyed the intimacy and on whose effusion of light they [the accursed] had drawn by the strength of their sincerity, and in whose constant companionship they had found rest, enjoying their blessedness and their breaths at the rising radiance of the gleam of their states, [cursing them] by abandoning them and relinquishing their companionship, rejecting them and turning away from them because of their [the accursed ones'] loss of that [light] and their [the cursers'] sensing the sullying of their purity."
