  "text": "The Jews say, 'The Christians have nothing', because of their being veiled by their religion from their [the Jews'] religion; likewise say the Christians because of their being veiled by the esoteric aspect from the exoteric one, as the Jews are veiled from the esoteric aspect by the exoteric one, which is the situation today with the various schools of Islam; and the Christians say, 'The Jews stand on nothing'; yet they recite the Scripture, which contains what would guide them to the removal of that veil and seeing the truth of every religion and [every] dogmatic school, for the truth of the people of that religion or school is not false since they adhere to those beliefs: otherwise what is the difference between them and those who have neither knowledge nor scripture, as is the case with the polytheists, for what these [latter] say is the same as what the former say, nay they [the polytheists] are less blameworthy since there is only the proof of the intellect against them, while the others have both the proofs of the intellect and those of the Law. [Thus, the ignorant say the like of what these say]; God shall decide between them regarding their differences, [He shall decide between them] with the truth concerning their differences, on the Day of, the event of the major, Resurrection, and the manifestation of the Essential Unity upon the emergence of the Messiah (al-Mahdī), peace be upon him. According to ḥadīth it is that God will disclose Himself to His servants in the form of their belief and they will know Him, whereupon He will transform Himself from that form to another form and they will not know Him: thereupon they will all be misguided and veiled, except what God wills; and He is the One whose Oneness is affirmed but who is not tied to the form of His belief."
