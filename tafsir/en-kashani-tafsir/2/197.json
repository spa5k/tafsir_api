  "text": "The Pilgrimage is in months well-known, in other words, the time for the Pilgrimage is a series of defined periods, namely, from the attainment of physical maturity to the age of forty, as He said in the description of the cow, [that it was] neither old nor virgin, [but] middling between that [Q. 2:68]; whoever undertakes the duty of Pilgrimage during them, upon himself with resolve and commits himself, then no lewdness, that is, [no] lewd act by the manifestation of the appetitive faculty, nor wickedness, no revilement [of others], meaning, the dissent of the irascible faculty against obedience to the heart, or disputing, that is, violating the rational faculty by means of a devilish act, in the Pilgrimage, that is, when seeking the house of the heart. Whatever good you do, in the way of a meritorious act through these three faculties by the command of the Law and that of the intellect, to the exclusion of any despicable acts, God knows it, and will reward you for it. And take provision, from the meritorious aspects [of these faculties] which necessarily means that you avoid the despicable ones; for the best provision is guard oneself, against such [despicable acts], and fear you Me, in your actions and intentions, O people of pith!, for the main issue for the pith [your innermost heart], that is, the intellect that is pure from any of the blemishes of illusion and the husk of matter, is to fear Me."
