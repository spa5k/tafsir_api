  "text": "He has only forbidden you: carrion, because blood in it is congealed and [because the consumption of] it is far removed from [the principle of] moderation by the deviation of that [creature's] constitution; blood, because it mixes with impure faeces which do not receive life, justice and luminosity and because of its ineligibility for such [things] thereafter on account of the lack of maturity; the flesh of swine, because of the prevalence of predatorialness and voraciousness and because it [swine] by nature openly engages in filth and unrestricted sexual behaviour, and the same is caused by the consumption of it; what has been hallowed to other than God, that for which the voice has been raised that it be sacrificed for other than God, in other words, that by whose sacrifice and consumption association [of things with God] was intended, since this is contradictory to the affirmation of Oneness and revealing of an associationism; from this [statement] one is given to understand that [it] also [includes] whatever encourages the one consuming it to speak of, and raise his voice [in support of], anything other than God. In other words, every thing that is not consumed in affirmation of [His] Oneness is forbidden to the one consuming it. Yet whoever is constrained, from among the community, not desiring, [sinfulness] against another constrained person by withholding it [from him], nor transgressing, but just to stay alive, no sin shall be on him. [God is Forgiving, Merciful.]"
