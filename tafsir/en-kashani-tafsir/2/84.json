  "text": "And when We made a covenant with you: 'Do not shed your own blood, by desiring the abodes and attributes of the soul and by inclining towards its caprices and natures, while abandoning your true life and the specific qualities of your acts for the sake of securing its goals and pleasures; neither expel your selves, your essences since the essence is represented by the self, from your habitations', that is, from your spiritual abodes and the holy gardens. Then you confirmed it, by accepting that [covenant], and you bore witness, to it through your initial states of preparedness and your primordial intellects."
