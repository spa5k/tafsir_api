  "text": "And those, polytheists, without knowledge, of His Oneness, say, 'Why does God not speak to usḍ; Why does a sign not come to usḍ' So, spoke those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are much alike, in terms of [their] ignorance of [His] Oneness and the words of God and His signs, since knowledge of these is a branch of the knowledge of [His] Oneness. Yet We have made clear [the signs], the proofs of Oneness and the modality of communion [with God], to a people who are certain."
