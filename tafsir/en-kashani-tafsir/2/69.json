  "text": "[They said, 'Pray to your Lord for us, that He make clear to us what her colour may be'. He said, 'He says she shall be a cow] golden, because the colour of the body is black, lacking as it is in luminosity in the first place; the colour of the vegetative soul is green because of the manifestation in it of luminosity, while the prevalence of black in it is on account of its inability to perceive; the colour of the heart is white because of its being disengaged from the body, its perceptive capability and the perfection of its luminosity. Necessarily then the colour of the animal soul in speechless animals is red because of the composite nature of the luminosity of its perception and the blackness of its attachment to the body, since 'red' is a colour between white and black and is composed of them both, albeit the black predominates; it [the soul] is yellow in human beings because the luminosity of its perception predominates by its adjacency to the heart, for yellow is red coloured by white; bright in colour, due to the purity of its preparedness and the radiance of the beam of the heart's light upon it; gladdening to beholders', because of the strength of its preparedness and its radiance. The 'beholders' are the perfect individuals who look upon preparednesses because of their obligatory love for the prepared who are able to see and their tasting in their presence."
