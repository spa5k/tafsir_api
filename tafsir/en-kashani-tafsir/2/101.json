  "text": "When there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what was with them, a party of them who were given the Scripture have cast away the Scripture of God behind their backs, as though they did not know.This is manifest [in meaning] and can be known from what has already been [mentioned in previous verses]. The exoteric sense is that Gabriel is the active intellect, Michael is the spirit of the sixth celestial sphere, from his intellect emanates the universal vegetative soul charged with the provision of [God's] servants; Isrāfīl is the spirit of the fourth celestial sphere, from his intellect emanates the universal animal soul that is in charge of the animals; ʿIzrāÌīl is the spirit of the seventh celestial sphere and he is in charge of all human spirits which he seizes by himself or through intermediaries who are his assistants whereupon he hands them over to God, exalted be He."
