[And when they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe']but when they go in private one to another, at moments of forgetfulness they prevent one another from casting [onto others] what God has disclosed to them in the way of objects of perception that may be sensory, imaginal or estimative, so that they might compose therefrom arguments and dispute with them thereby in the Spiritual Presence before their Lord; [they say: 'Do you speak to them of what God has disclosed to you, so that they may thereby dispute with you before your Lordḍ Have you no understandingḍ']."
