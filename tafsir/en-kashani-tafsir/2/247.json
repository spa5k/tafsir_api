  "text": "[Then their prophet said to them, 'Verily as king for you God has raised up] Saul: [he] was a poor man of no [distinguished] lineage and no wealth and so they did not accept him as king, because according to the generality the eligibility for kingship and leadership is through [the manifestation of] outer felicity, that is wealth and lineage, which is why their prophet warned them that eligibility is rather through the other two felicities, that of the spirit, which is knowledge and that of the body, which is increased physical strength and solid build and breadth, by saying [to them]: 'and He has increased him broadly in knowledge and body, and God knows best who is fit for kingship and gives it [the kingship] to whom He will; and God is Embracing, great in gift, giving wealth as He gives kingship, Knowing, who is eligible and what wealth such [a person] would need to support himself and give it to him [accordingly]. He then makes it clear that [an individual's] fitness for kingship entails another sign which is that [God's] creatures submit to him and that awe of him and respect for him alight in their hearts and that their hearts are at peace with him, and that they love him and cede to his command in obedience and compliance; that is what the ancient Persians used to call khoreh that was exclusive to the Kayanian [Persian] Kings. Thereafter, they called [this special aura] farr and said that the farr of kingship was possessed by Fereydun; and that when it had disappeared from Kay Kāvus, they sought the one who possessed this farr and found it in the blessed King Kay Khusrau, who then called it the tābūt, that is, the thing to which he would refer all matters - because tābūt is [based on the grammatical paradigm] faʿlūt from [the infinitive] al-tawb [to return]; in other words, there will come to you from this [tābūt] what will establish his kingship by way of submission, obedience, compliance and love for him which God will cast into your hearts - as the Prophet said, 'I was given victory [over my enemies] through terror [being cast into their hearts] even [they happen to be] at a distance of one month's journeying' - or [it meant] that to which he will refer in terms of his ego-centric condition and his [spiritual] configuration (hayÌa), which will testify to the validity of his kingship."
