  "text": "And when he turns his back, he hastens about the earth [to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock], because of his disregard of the Law and his heresy, which is the case that you see with most of those who claim love [of God] and affirmation of the Oneness, and God loves not corruption: in other words, he is a worker of corruption but claims to love God. But how would such [love] be forthcoming in his case when the lover only does what his beloved loves and God does not love what he does. Such a person cannot be truthful in his claim, as the poet says:'You disobey the Divine while you outwardly manifest love of Him.That is vile, an act unheard of. For if your love were truthful you would be obedient to Him. Indeed, the lover is to his beloved obedient'."
