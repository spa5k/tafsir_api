  "text": "And establish prayer, and pay the alms, seeking My approval instead of anticipating My reward: this is corroborated by His statement, and bow with those that bow, since the act of bowing is submission and obedience to the object of that act; it is the sign of satisfaction which is the legacy of the self-disclosure of the attributes. The purpose [of that] is to say: be satisfied with what I decree when you inspect My attributes. The orientation upon the performance of the act is the indication that reward and recompense is being sought on account of the soul being independent with its form. Prostration which is the ultimate submission is the sign of being annihilated in the unity upon the self-disclosure of the Essence."
