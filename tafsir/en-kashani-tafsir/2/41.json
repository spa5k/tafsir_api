  "text": "And believe in what I have revealed, of the QurÌān to My beloved of the unity of [My] attributes, confirming that which is with you, in the Torah of the unity of [My] acts, and be not the first to disbelieve in it, that is, the first to be veiled therefrom, veiled as you are by your belief. And do not sell, that is, do not exchange, My signs, those indicating the self-disclosures of My essence and attributes, such as the sūrat al-ikhlāṣ [Q. 112] and the kursī-verse [Q. 2:255] and the like, for a small price, that is, for the paradise of your soul because of your habituation to the sensory pleasures and the reward of deeds through the affirmation of the unity of acts. If you [are wont to] guard against association [of others with Me], then guard against the assault of My overwhelming power, majesty and veil by seeking My approval and not affirming an attribute to any other than Me; [and fear Me]."
