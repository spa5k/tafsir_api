  "text": "[O you who believe] come into submission [all of you], meaning, into surrender and the submission of your countenances to God, since the mutual enmity between the faculties and their discord in failing to submit to God's command is proof that you are following [the steps of] Satan, who wishes for you to merit God's subjugation by committing reprehensible acts of excess, because of his instinctive enmity towards you on account of his innate disposition being different from yours and [on account of] his lacking the light of your primordial nature, given that he was created from fire and seeks only that you be fiery like him and not luminous. He is thus an enemy in the form of a lover."
