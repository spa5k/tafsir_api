According to another interpretation [it means]: 'And We appointed for Moses the heart upon his becoming attached to the body and veiled from his people, the spiritual powers, for the forty nights during which his corporeal structure was being created; then you took to worshipping the calf of the animal soul, [Moses] as the infant, after his absence in the state of childhood; then We pardoned you after that, worship by the real maturation [of Moses] and the self-manifestation of the light of the heart upon your disengagement, so that you might be thankful for the grace of My granting you success in [attaining] that disengagement and My preparing [for you] of the means for your perfection by your following of the path of My attributes."
