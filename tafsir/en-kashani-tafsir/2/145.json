  "text": "Yet if you should bring to those who have been given the Scripture every sign, that is proof of the soundness of your prophethood and the validity of your prayer-direction, even if it should be from their own scripture or an incontrovertible rational one, they will not follow your direction, on account of their being veiled by their religion and their intelligibles and their confinement to them; and you are not a follower of their direction, because of your transcending the level of their religion and your rising above their station; neither are they followers of one another's direction, because each of them is veiled by his religion and because of the contradictoriness of their directions that originates in the contradictoriness that is at the centre of [each of] their natures. If you were to follow their, sundry, whims after the knowledge, of unity that comprehends you, has come to you, then you will surely be among [the evildoers], [among] those who have diminished what is your due and what is due to your station [as prophet]."
