  "text": "[Never will the Jews be pleased with you, neither the Christians, not until you follow their creed,] Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance', that is to say, the path of Oneness that is specifically qualified by truth is the path and none other, as [Imam] ʿAlī [b. Abī Ṭālib], peace be upon him, said: 'Right and left lead astray, only the middle path [in-between] is the [true] route'. And if you were to follow their whims, after the knowledge that has come to you, that is, the knowledge of Oneness and gnosis, you shall have against God neither friend, nor helper, because of the impossibility of there existing any other than Him."
