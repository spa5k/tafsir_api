  "text": "And when We appointed the House, of the heart, to be a place of visitation, a place of return and a place of settlement, for the people, and a sanctuary, a place of security or a cause for security and safety for them in which they shall feel secure and at peace upon their arrival there from the dangers of the attributes of the soul and [from] the havoc of the destructive and corruptive faculties of nature, and [from] the conjurings of the satans of illusion and imagination and their seductions and devices. 'Take to yourselves Abraham's station, which is the station of the spirit and the station of friendship, as a place of prayer', a place for true prayer which is the witnessing and the divine union and the friendship of the tasting; and We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael, 'Purify My House, We commanded them to purify the House of the heart from the defilements of the conversations of the soul and the impurities of the evil whisperings of Satan and the filth of the motivations of caprice and the dirt of the attributes of the faculties, for those that shall go round it, that is, for the yearning wayfarers who go round the heart during their journey, and those that cleave to it, those who have arrived at the station of the heart through that reliance that is the affirmation of the unity of the acts, those who reside therein without the variegations of the soul that could drive [them] away from it, to those who bow, that is, those who have submitted, who have reached the station of the self-disclosure of the attributes and the perfect level of satisfaction, and those who prostrate themselves', those annihilated in the Oneness."
