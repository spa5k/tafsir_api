  "text": "And when it is said to him, 'Fear God', he is seized by vainglory in his sin, in other words, egocentric zealotry, the zealotry of pagandom [cf. Q. 48:26] has driven him to sin in obstinacy and insolence because of his soul's becoming manifest at that point and his claim that he is better informed about his actions than the one counselling him; so Gehenna shall be enough for him, that is, his ultimate goal is the very depth of his lowly level, in which he is, and its darkness, for Gehenna means a darkened abyss of unfathomable depth."
