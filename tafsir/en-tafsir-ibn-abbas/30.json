(Allah created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them) of created beings and marvels, (save with truth) save for the Truth and the establishment of commands and prohibitions and not merely for falsehood (and for a destined end) and for an appointed time in which there will be requital. (But truly many of mankind) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (are disbelievers in) deny (the meeting with their Lord) resurrection after death."

      "text": "(Have they not travelled) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (in the land and seen) and reflect upon (the nature of the consequence for) the requital of (those who were before them) when they disbelieved in their messengers? (They were stronger than these in power) in physical strength, (and they dug the earth) for agriculture more than the people of Mecca did; it is also said that this means: they travelled more for their trade (and built upon it) and lived in their buildings (more than these have built) more than the period in which the people of Mecca lived in their buildings. (Messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) with commands, prohibitions and signs but they disbelieved and Allah, Exalted is He, destroyed them because of their disbelief. (Surely Allah wronged them not) when He destroyed them, (but they did wrong themselves) through their disbelief, idolatry and denial of the messengers."
