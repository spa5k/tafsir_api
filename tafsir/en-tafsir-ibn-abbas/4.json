(He who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave) a slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger, (and pay the blood money) in full (to the family of the slain) to the next of kin of the victim who have the right to demand retaliation, (unless they remit it as a charity) unless the next of kin of the victim remit the blood money to the killer as a charity. (If he) the victim (be of a people hostile unto you) who are at war with you, (and he) i.e. the victim (is a believer, then (the penance is) to set free a believing slave) the killer should set free a slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger and so does not have to pay the blood money. Harith belonged to a people who were at war with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). (And if he) the victim (cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a covenant) a treaty and peace, (then the blood money must be paid) in full (unto his folk) to the next of kin of the victim (and (also) a believing slave must be set free) a slave who believes in the divine Oneness of Allah. (And whoso hath not the wherewithal) to set free a believing slave (must fast two consecutive months) continuously. (A penance from Allah) if he does this, Allah will forgive him for killing a believer by mistake. (Allah is Knower) of him who kills by mistake, (Wise) in that which he ought to do."

When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah) in jihad, (be careful to discriminate) between who is a believer and who is an unbeliever, (and say not unto one who offereth you peace) he who greets you and says to you �there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah�: (�Thou art not a believer�;) and then kill him (seeking the chance profits of this life) so that you may despoil him. (With Allah are plenteous spoils) He has with Him a tremendous reward for him who avoids killing a fellow believer. (Even thus (as he now is) were ye before) with your people feeling safe with the believers and with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions because of the attestation of �there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah�, before the Emigration; (but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you) by migrating from the unbelievers. (Therefore take care to discriminate) such that you do not kill believers. (Allah is ever informed of what ye do) whether it is killing someone or other things."
