So they said: �O Muhammad! When will the torment which you promised us happen?� As a response, Allah revealed: (The commandment of Allah will come to pass) the chastisement of Allah has come. The Prophet (pbuh) was sitting at that point and he suddenly stood, having no doubt in his mind that the chastisement had come. But immediately after that, Allah said: (so seek not ye to hasten it) i.e. the chastisement, at which the Prophet (pbuh) sat down. (Glorified) Allah exonerated Himself from having a son or partner (and Exalted be He) He is too elevated and absolves Himself (above all that they associate (with Him)) of idols."

This verse was revealed about the tribes of Kindah and Murad; it is also said that this means: honour your pledges when you swear by Allah, (and break not your oaths) i.e. the pledges that you pledge between yourselves (after the asseveration of them) after ascertaining and confirming them, (and after ye have made Allah surety over you) i.e. a Witness over you; it is also said that this means: a Guardian over you. Meaning: both parties made their pledge and said: Allah is witness that we will honour our pledge. (Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do) whether you break or honour your pledges."
