There is another way of understanding the above: those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture, before the advent Muhammad (pbuh) such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, and those who ascribed partners to Allah before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such as Abu Bakr and his fellow Arabs, would not have desisted from their disbelief and idolatry until the clear proof came to them, i.e. until Muhammad (pbuh) came to them."

Allah then mentioned belief in Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (That) i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness (is true religion) the religion of truth, straight without any crookedness; it is also said that this means: that, i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness, is the religion of the angels; and it is also said this means: it is the religion of those who are by nature upright; and it is also said this means: the religion of Abraham."
