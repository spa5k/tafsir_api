(And Allah heareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al-Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by the jinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angry and said: �if you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just as my mother is�."

      "text": "(O ye who believe! When it is said) when the Prophet (pbuh) says: (Make room in assemblies, then make room; Allah will make way for you (Hereafter)) in the Hereafter. This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it was revealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. These people went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah. When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet (pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, he noticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them this verse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along with faith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have no knowledge. This is because a believer who is knowledgeable is better than a believer who is not. (Allah is informed of what ye do) of good or evil."

This was revealed about those believers who were well off and used to speak to the Prophet (pbuh) more than the poor believers, so much so that they vexed both the Prophet (pbuh) and the poor believers. Allah, therefore, forbade them from doing so and commanded them to give alms to the poor, one silver coin for each word they would say to him, before they even spoke with the Prophet (pbuh). (That) almsgiving (is better) than holding back money (and purer for you) and purer for your hearts from sins; and it is also said this means: it is purer for the hearts of the poor in that it prevents their hearts from becoming hard. (But if ye cannot find (the wherewithal)) to give alms, O poor believers, then you can speak with the Prophet (pbuh) as much as you wish without being required to give alms (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives your sins, (Merciful) towards the one among you who dies repentant."

(Then, when ye do it not) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in that which He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you.

From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: �You should free a slave�. Aws said: �I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave�. The Prophet (pbuh) said: �Then you should fast two successive months�. Aws said: �I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast�. The Prophet (pbuh) said: �Then you should feed 60 needy ones�. Aws said: �I can not afford it�. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: �I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I�. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself."
