The Banu Sahm said at that point: �We were rooted out by injustice in the pagan era; go and count the living and the dead of our people and the living and the dead of your people�. When they did so they found out that the Banu Sahm were more numerous. Therefore the above verses were revealed about them: bragging about status and lineage distracted you to the extent that you visited the graveyards to count the dead; it is also said that this means: increase in wealth and children distracts you until you die and be put in the graves."
