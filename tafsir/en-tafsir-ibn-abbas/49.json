Be not forward in the presence of Allah): '(O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah) do not start with any word or action until the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) commands or prohibits you first; it is also said that this means: do not start immolating your sacrifices on the day of immolation (and His messenger) until you receive Allah's command and the command of His Messenger; it is also said that this means: do not oppose the Messenger; and it is said this means: do not contravene the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in relation to saying or doing anything without the command of Allah or of His Messenger, and do not oppose the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your works. This was revealed about three prophetic Companions who killed two men from Banu Salim when the Muslims had a peace treaty with them, without being commanded to do so by Allah or by His Messenger. Allah, glorified and Exalted is He, forbade them from engaging in any matter without a command from Allah or His Messenger."

Let not a folk deride a folk) this was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who mentioned a man of the Helpers with something bad; he mentioned the man's mother about whom he used to taunted in the pre-Islamic period, but Allah forbade him from saying ill things about fellow believers, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; referring here specifically to Thabit! (Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him, (nor let women (deride) women) this was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) who derided Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, and Allah forbade them from doing so (who may be better than they are) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him; (neither defame one another) do not defame your believing brothers nor backbite against each other, (nor insult one another by nicknames) which were used in the pre-Islamic period. (Bad is the name of lewdness) it is bad to call your brother: �O Jew�, �O Christian�, �O Magian� (after faith) after having accepted faith and turned his back on all that. (And whoso turneth not in repentance) from calling his brothers with such names and nicknames after having accepted faith, (such are evil-doers) such are those who harm themselves with punishment. This was revealed about Abu Burdah Ibn Malik al-Ansari and 'Abdullah Ibn Hadrad al-Aslami who had a dispute and Allah forbade them from doing so."

(Shun much suspicion) this was revealed about two Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, the Servant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion about others, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) for some ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not) and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; and this is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting your brother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant."

When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men from Quraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: �Did Allah and His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven�. In response, Allah said: (Lo! We have created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another.

But their presence in Medina caused a rise in the price of foodstuffs and the streets of Medina became full of their impurities. In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: �O Messenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us�. When Allah mentioned their claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: �We are genuine in our faith in Allah and His Messenger�. But Allah said: (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faith in Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say �We submit�) we submit so that we may be spared from the sword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith have not entered your hearts.
