Their thinking is dominated by their national traditions and contemporary mores. For this reason, the prophet’s unadulterated religion does not fit the pattern or mould of their thought.  He appears a stranger to them. This difference acts as a mental barrier between the prophet and the common people.  Unable to see the prophet’s call in its proper perspective, they are not prepared to accept it. The prophet’s call is in itself extremely rational. It is in itself a proof that it has come from God. But the aforesaid mental barrier proves so impregnable that a man is unable to penetrate it in order to grasp the meaning of the prophet’s call. Thus God opens the doors of His Grace to man, but he does not pass through them."

      "text": "A study of the universe reveals that its creation has been effected gradually in a phased manner. Creation in this way—in other words by stages, means planned creation; and when the creation of the universe has been so carried out, it essentially follows that it has a Planner who has purposefully created it according to a set plan. Similarly, there are mountains on this earth at various places that maintain the balance of the earth. There are millions of species of living organisms on this earth and every species requires different types of sustenance, which are  found in its habitat. Similarly, a study of the universe also shows that initially all things were in the shape  of divided atoms. Then they combined to form different entities. It is further evident from such a study that all the things in this immense universe are uniformly governed by the laws of nature. These observations clearly establish that the Creator of the universe is all-knowing and all-aware.  He is all-powerful and dominant.  So, who else can be there whom a man can treat as being worthy of worship?"

If this rejection is of a call given by a prophet, the punishment for this starts  right here in this world, just as happened in the case of the communities of ‘Ad and Thamud. The main point of the call for Truth has always been that man should become a worshipper of God. He should associate with the one and only God his feelings of fear and love. But in every age it has happened that the contemporaries of the Prophet opined that his personality was too unimpressive to have been chosen by God as His messenger. Therefore, they refused to accept his words."

The theory of ‘skin speech’ of modern times has established the feasibility of such a happening. It has now been discovered that every utterance a man makes is recorded on the skin of his body and that it can be heard once again, just like a voice recorded by mechanical devices. Since God is not visible, man carries the impression that God does not see him. This misunderstanding gives rise to arrogance in man. But if a man realises that he is being observed by God at all times, his whole behaviour will change.

Contrary to this, denigration means desisting from presenting any arguments in connection with the matter under consideration and simply trying rather to find defects in it, cast a slur on it, thus making it the target of condemnation. The method of criticism is the most legitimate, while the method of ferretting out or imputing defects is the way of unbelievers. Moreover, the latter method amounts to denying the signs of God; because every true argument is a sign of God.

Even if people are not good to him, he should be good to them.

Almighty God has made it possible for unilateral good behaviour to be immensely persuasive. The preacher of God is aware of this God-given asset, and uses it to the utmost extent, even although it may involve crushing his own feelings and killing the urge to retaliate.

In ancient times, the sun, the moon and stars appeared quite dazzling to man, so he took them as deities and started worshipping them. In the present age, it is the glamour of the material side of civilization which appears dazzling. So, materialism has now been given the same status as was enjoyed in former times by the sun and the moon, though the sun, the moon and other phenomena are all creations of God. A man should worship the Creator and not His creations. The arrogance of the proud is not related to the call of Truth but to the preacher giving that call.  It appears to the leaders of an age that the preacher of Truth is smaller in stature than themselves and that therefore  the message conveyed by him is also of lesser import."

In this way man is informed that God has made extensive and elaborate arrangements in this world to refresh and invigorate his dry existence.

Similarly, if man allows God’s guidance to permeate his existence, he too will become reanimated upon receiving it. The main reason for a man’s not benefitting from God’s guidance is that he distorts God’s message. When God’s guidance comes to him, he does not take it as it is, instead he tries to ferret out some points in it which he may misrepresent. In this way, God’s guidance does not become a part of his mind.  It does not nourish his soul.

Their thinking is dominated by their national traditions and contemporary mores. For this reason, the prophet’s unadulterated religion does not fit the pattern or mould of their thought.  He appears a stranger to them. This difference acts as a mental barrier between the prophet and the common people.  Unable to see the prophet’s call in its proper perspective, they are not prepared to accept it. The prophet’s call is in itself extremely rational. It is in itself a proof that it has come from God. But the aforesaid mental barrier proves so impregnable that a man is unable to penetrate it in order to grasp the meaning of the prophet’s call. Thus God opens the doors of His Grace to man, but he does not pass through them."

The proof of its being so is that untruth cannot enter it either from the front or from behind, i.e., there is no possibility of interference with it from any side.   It cannot be distorted either directly or indirectly. And this holds true now and for all time to come. This is  a very extraordinary forecast to make. In terms of the cause-and-effect system of this world, if this forecast has to come true, it is necessary that a strong community should permanently exist as the bearer of the Quran; it should not be at variance with the teachings of previous prophets; nobody should ever be able to find fault with the Quran; the evolution of knowledge should never result in contradiction of any of its statements; the vicissitudes of history should not exert any influence upon it; the language of the Quran, Arabic, should always remain a living language. Islam’s long history after the revelation of the Quran shows that, surprisingly, all these factors in its favour have strongly resisted erosion. The very convergence of these factors is quite extraordinary: there is no other book except the Quran in respect of which so many positive factors have continuously remained accumulated for so long a period as one thousand five hundred years. This is sufficient proof that the Quran is the Book of God. The greatness of the Quran must be discovered through argument and reasoning and not by a display of power.  Its greatness will be apparent  on the basis of power on the Day of Judgement. But then those who did not accept God’s Truth on the strength of arguments would be compelled to accept this Truth by being humbled."

      "text": "When the Quran was revealed in the Arabic language, opponents of Islam  said that this was the Prophet Muhammad’s mother tongue, and therefore it was not difficult for him to write some sort of book in Arabic and present it as holy scripture. They further said that had he really been a prophet, he would have delivered discourses in a strange language with the help of God. Non-serious and insincere people alone indulge in such talk, and such people can never be satisfied. For example, if it had happened that the prophet had approached the Arab people and started talking to them in Greek or Syriac or Persian language, the people would have had grounds for saying; ‘How strange is this prophet! He says that he has come to guide the people, but he speaks in a language which is not understood by his audience.’ The fact is that only those people are able to accept the Truth who are serious about it. Those who are not serious about the Truth are unable to understand even the clearest of its points.  The analogy befitting them is that of a person who is called from a very far-off place. Such a person will hear some voice, but he will be unable to make out its real sense."

This veil, which was required to be torn asunder, is then turned into a source of doubt. But this doubt cannot be an excuse for anybody on the Day of Judgement, because it proves that man was not serious about the issue of Truth. Man is perfectly serious in the matter of his worldly interests and therefore he tears down all the veils and discovers the reality.

Similarly, there are mountains on this earth at various places that maintain the balance of the earth. There are millions of species of living organisms on this earth and every species requires different types of sustenance, which are  found in its habitat. Similarly, a study of the universe also shows that initially all things were in the shape  of divided atoms. Then they combined to form different entities. It is further evident from such a study that all the things in this immense universe are uniformly governed by the laws of nature. These observations clearly establish that the Creator of the universe is all-knowing and all-aware.  He is all-powerful and dominant.  So, who else can be there whom a man can treat as being worthy of worship?"
