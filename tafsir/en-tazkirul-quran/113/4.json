  "text": "This chapter, containing five verses, was revealed at Makkah. It is a prayer for protection. The title of the chapter is derived from verse no. 1, which asks people to seek refuge in ‘the Lord of the Dawn or Daybreak’ from every kind of ill arising from outer nature and from the envy and the dark and evil plottings of others. God is the One who rends the darkness of night and brings out from it the light of dawn. It is this God who can remove the dark clouds of trouble overshadowing a man and bring him into the sunshine of well-being. The present world has been made with a view to putting human beings to the test. So, here there is evil along with good. The only way for man to be safe from the ill effects of evil is to seek refuge in God against it. Evil is of different kinds. For example, the mischief indulged in by evil-hearted people in the dead of the night, and the practitioners of witchcraft. Similarly, there are individuals who, seeing others living prosperously, become jealous and make the latter the victims of their jealousy-inspired actions. A believer should seek refuge in God from the mischief of all such people, and undoubtedly it is God alone who has the power to protect man from all kinds of evil.",
