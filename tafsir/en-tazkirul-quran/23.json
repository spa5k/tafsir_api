Realisation of God is not a simple matter. It brings about a revolution in the life of a man. He becomes a worshipper of God and bows down before Him in submission. His sincerity and seriousness increase to the extent that wasting time in useless pursuits appears fatal to him. He sets aside a portion of his earnings in the name of God and with that he helps the needy. He exercises control over his sexual desires and gives free rein to them only within the limit prescribed by God for the purpose. He lives his life in this world as a responsible person and never misappropriates whatever is entrusted to him. Such a man never dishonours any pledge undertaken by him. Those who possess these qualities are the favoured subjects of God.  These are the people for whom God has kept ready the ideal world, namely, the gardens of Paradise. After death they will be sent into this sublime atmosphere so that they may savour its joys forever."

While one accepts the call for Truth—in spite of all its unfamiliarity—the other ignores it or even ridicules it. While one abstains from indulging in cruelty—solely because God has prohibited it, another becomes a tyrant at the very first opportunity, because his self-interest bids him do so.

The Lord of this universe will certainly scorn those who scoffed at the Truth and will show His appreciation for those who valued it."

They presume him to be a madman and ignore him. It has been the story of every community that, as time has gone on, it has started following the traditions of its forefathers instead of following the real teachings of God.

That is why a prophet’s contemporaries fail to recognize him. To them the prophet appears to be a man who makes false claims to prophethood in order to be taken as a great man. They presume him to be a madman and ignore him. It has been the story of every community that, as time has gone on, it has started following the traditions of its forefathers instead of following the real teachings of God. Whenever a prophet appeared and again preached genuine religion, they felt that the prophet’s religion was different from the traditions of its forefathers. Given the mindset of these people, their forefathers appeared to be greater and the prophet appeared to be a comparatively lesser person. This is the main reason why the call of the prophets of every period seemed a strange cry to their contemporaries."

In ancient times, the Jews enjoyed the position of being a prophet-raising community. But, having continuously indulged in arrogant behaviour, they forfeited this entitlement. The time had come for this trust to be taken away from them and handed over to another community, in this case, the Children of Ishmael. Therefore, as a way of bringing to a conclusion the religious predominance of the Jews, God caused their last prophet to be born in a miraculous manner and gave him some additional miracles to perform. The Jews, however, persisted in rejecting him, and this finally proved that they did not deserve to be a community into which prophets should be born. This was a very critical moment for the Messiah’s mother, Mary. In these circumstances, she was in dire need of a corner where she could live away from the eyes of the people, and where the necessities of life should be available in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. When Almighty God placed her in this critical position, He also provided for her a peaceful place near her home."

      "text": "When the religion of God is revived in its true spirit, it instills the fear of God in people’s minds but when religion loses its true spirit, it becomes a mere source of boasting and pride for its adherents. This is the time when men of religion split into a number of groups. Each group chooses for itself that aspect which feeds its pride. Groups which feed on pride are always many in number, while the religion of the God-fearing is always one. An absence of fear breeds a diversity of opinions, while a God-fearing mentality leads to uniformity of opinion. In the present world, man is being put to test. During the period of respite allowed to an individual or a group at God’s behest, all the amenities of life are provided. On account of this, negligent people think that whatever they are doing is right and that, if they had been wrong, their possessions and all comfort and convenience would have been snatched away from them. But, by God’s method, a man’s possession are taken away from him, not on his flouting God’s will during the trial period, but in the world hereafter."

But, it seldom happens that man uses his wisdom in the real sense. He forms opinions on the basis of outward appearances. There are very few who consciously and openly deny the existence of the life hereafter. However, many can in fact be said to reject this belief. These are such as only formally accept the existence of the life hereafter, but in practice lead their lives as if they have no belief that they will be resurrected after death and presented before God to account for their deeds."

Most people admit that the Creator of the earth and the heavens is the one and only God; that He is their Lord and He controls them; that He enjoys all the superior powers. Yet their lives do not in any way reflect this acknowledgement. Such sublime truth demands that it permeates their thinking. The realisation of God should make them truly God-conscious. It should so become a part of their nature that, when they come face to face with the Truth, they admit it immediately. Their whole life should be moulded upon it. But, in actual fact, none of this happens. They accept God as a formal belief, but their real lives are not affected by it. The conception of God does not cast any spell over such individuals. On the contrary, they remain enamoured of trivial things. How strange is man’s behaviour!"

      "text": "In this world of God, success is for one who is a true believer, one who devotes himself fully to God and not to anybody other than God, and who leads a God-oriented life. Realisation of God is not a simple matter. It brings about a revolution in the life of a man. He becomes a worshipper of God and bows down before Him in submission. His sincerity and seriousness increase to the extent that wasting time in useless pursuits appears fatal to him. He sets aside a portion of his earnings in the name of God and with that he helps the needy. He exercises control over his sexual desires and gives free rein to them only within the limit prescribed by God for the purpose. He lives his life in this world as a responsible person and never misappropriates whatever is entrusted to him. Such a man never dishonours any pledge undertaken by him. Those who possess these qualities are the favoured subjects of God.  These are the people for whom God has kept ready the ideal world, namely, the gardens of Paradise. After death they will be sent into this sublime atmosphere so that they may savour its joys forever."

Now, he realises that the life Hereafter, which he had hitherto ignored, was in fact the real target in life. The possessions of the pre-death period were for the purpose of earning credit towards the life Hereafter and not as ends in themselves. So, after death, he will immediately want to be sent back to this world. But this will not be possible, because in accordance with the creation plan of God, every man is given only one chance. In the present world man relies on his friends and relatives, but on Judgement Day he will be all alone. There, only his good deeds will be of avail. Nothing else will save him."
