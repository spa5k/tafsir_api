In this universe, the earth is an extremely exceptional sphere, upon which numerous factors and arrangements have made human life possible. Among these arrangements are the maintenance of balance by the rising mountains on the earth, and also the plentiful existence of valuable things like water, greenery, etc. There is nobody except Almighty God who can manage this huge system. As such, is it legitimate for man to worship things other than God?"

The Quran says that Luqman was a grateful subject of God and who, as a father, advised his son to save himself from polytheism. Polytheism holds that beings other than God are man’s benefactors and that, man should direct his feelings of gratitude towards them.  The belief in the oneness of God stems from the intense realisation that God is the sole benefactor of man and as such all his gratitude should be shown only to that One."

This irrational behaviour is otherwise known as polytheism, or ascribing partners to God (shirk). The Majesty of God is too great to be expressed in words. The history of physical sciences is spread over thousands of years.

For example man does not know the exact number of stars that exist in space, nor the number of species of animals and vegetation found on the earth. He remains unaware about the true nature and composition of the leaf of a tree or a grain of sand or even the many wonders hidden in the sea. In short, there are few things, big or small, in this world, about which man has obtained full information. This in itself is enough to prove that if all the trees of the world are chiselled into pens and all the seas become the ink, it will still not suffice to record the innumerable feats of God."

Books which give good advice, are plentiful but he is always the more frequent purchaser of books which divert his mind and which do not demand any serious action on his part. The guilt of one who goes to the length of inducing others to indulge in purely entertaining (i.e.wasteful) pursuits is greater, because he has made himself the leader of dissipation, keeping people preoccupied with pointless activities and rendering them incapable of giving their attention to more serious affairs. Conceit is the worst trait in a man. If Truth presents itself before a conceited individual, he will not accept it, because he thinks too highly of himself. He will contemptuously overlook it and press on regardlessly. Just the opposite is true of the believers. Their advice-loving nature compels them to accept the truth and to surrender their life to it completely."
