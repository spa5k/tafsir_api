      "text": "The reality of religion is that man should apprehend the Being of God and His workmanship in the universe so intensely and realistically that the Being of the one God should become everything for him; man should fear only Him and on Him alone, should he build up his hopes. The one God should be the entire focus of his heart and mind. This is what constitutes the act of making God the object of worship (ilah) and amounts to praying to Him. All the prophets came into the world in order to bring about this condition. Those who prove to have this sense of submission to God will be treated as successful on Judgement Day, but those who go against this will be left without hope. For the general people, this decision will be taken on Doomsday (Judgement Day), but for the addressees of the prophet, it starts in this world itself. There is perfect unity in the universe and at the same time, there also is perfect meaningfulness. Unity in the universe makes it unwarranted for anyone to make somebody other than the one God the centre of his attention. And it is the natural consequence of its meaningfulness that it should meet a meaningful end. In this way, the system governing the universe provides arguments in favour of both the unity of God (tawhid) and the existence of the Hereafter."

This coordinated and harmonious action of ‘heaven and earth’ clearly proves that the God of earth is the same as that of heaven. There is perfect harmony among the different parts of the universe. This harmony is definite proof of the fact that the Creator and Lord of the whole universe is only one. In the present structure of the universe, there is no scope for more than one God, and when the real Creator and Lord is one God, making any thing other than Him an object of worship will be absolutely indefensible."

      "text": "There are two objectives in reading the Quran—one is for the guidance of the self and the other is to present it to others to encourage them to understand the Truth. Whether the actual words of the Quran are repeated or its meanings are explained, man should in any case seek the protection of God against Satan. It does not mean simply repeating some fixed words; it means consciously arming oneself so that Satan’s attack becomes ineffective. Satan is always lying in wait for man. He changes the meaning of the words of the Quran in the mind of the reader, and what cannot be included in the text he inserts in the commentary. In this way Satan raises controversial issues between the preacher and the addressee, as a result of which understanding the true meaning of the Quran becomes difficult. However, God has given liberty to Satan only to misguide and instigate. He has not given power to him to lead anyone astray by force (laysa lahu sultan). His actions have no effect on those who have maintained their mental connection with God. But those who are neglectful of God and pay attention to the word of Satan become subject to Satan, who leads them towards his evil path."

      "text": "The Quran is the Book of dawah. Its various parts were revealed bit by bit over a period of twenty three years. In consideration of the training of the believers, a gradual approach was adopted in respect of certain commandments. Taking advantage of such ‘changes’, the opponents of Islam used to say that the Quran was not the Book of God, but the Prophet Muhammad’s own writings which he attributed to God. They used to say that, if it had come directly from God, there would not have been such changes in it. Had these opponents been sincere and serious in the study of the Quran and had they looked upon the factor of change in the right perspective, they would have seen the wisdom of a gradual approach in giving orders. But when they saw the matter in the wrong perspective, changes appeared to them to be the result of a lack of human knowledge. A reasoned confirmation of these changes not being immediately forthcoming gave rise to the levelling of false allegations. The Quran has been revealed to present the Truth—here Truth means the pure and unadulterated religion of God. Those who are seekers after Truth and who are not satisfied with adulterated religions, will find not only the answer to their search in the Quranic religion but also peace of mind therein."

In various books of tafsir (commentary) their names have been given as Jabr, Yasar, ‘A’ish, Ya‘ish, etc. (there is some mention also of Salman al-Farsi who later became a Muslim). These slaves being either Jews or Christians were very knowledgeable about the ancient holy religions of Judaism and Christianity. From time to time they chanced to meet the Prophet Muhammad. On the basis of such meetings, the Chiefs of the Quraysh started saying, ‘The non-Arabs tell Muhammad something and he presents it to the people, declaring it to be “divine discourse.’” Why was this ridiculous statement made by them? It was due to the same common wrong approach which is found in every period all over the world; i.e. the refusal to recognize the value of one who is one’s own contemporary. The Prophet Muhammad was a contemporary personality for the Quraysh, and therefore, they failed to appreciate him. This verse shows that those who feel nothing but contempt for their contemporaries can never be truly inspired to accept the Truth. Instead of accepting the Truth, they fabricate false allegations against the messengers of the Truth; ignoring the greater facts, they seize upon irrelevant things amounting to hair-splitting in order to defame the preacher. They spend their entire lives in this way until the day of their death when they will be punished by God."

If a person is truly loyal to God in his heart, but under serious compulsion and to save his own life he utters something against his faith, he will not be castigated for this by God. But those who have changed from the inside and who, under the influence of Satanic doubt or the pressure of circumstances, have willingly adopted some way other than God’s way are not pardonable. When an individual behaves faithlessly rather than as a man of faith, the reason for it is always worldliness. Looking to the salvaging of his worldly interests, he adopts the way of the unbeliever. Had he understood the value of the Hereafter, worldly interest would have appeared of so little worth to him that renouncing the Hereafter for the sake of the world would have seemed absurd. If, in the eyes of any individual, worldly benefits appear to outweigh the gains of the Hereafter, the result is necessarily that he is not able to judge matters from the point of view of the Hereafter. He sees and hears, but due to his inclination toward the world, he loses sight of the various aspects of the Hereafter. He is only able to see those aspects which are connected with worldly considerations. Those who reach this stage of neglectfulness are fated to suffer eternal loss."

In the ancient polytheistic period, they attributed these foods to false gods and in this way made it the means of remembering false gods instead of the one and only God. In the atheistic modern period, man having made the whole matter subject to his personal tastes, those things prohibited by God have been treated as permissible by him. This has resulted in the things created by God becoming mere foodstuffs to cater to his tastes at the dining table.

But, in practice, they started going against these restrictions. The differences created in God’s religion by later scholars and other luminaries by means of their commentaries are not going to be resolved in the world, but when the Day of Judgement comes, God will then show what the real religion of God was and what the things were that the people themselves added to and included in their religion."

      "text": "The preacher’s call to the Truth is a process which emerges out of intense feelings of sincerity, seriousness and well-wishing. The realization of a man that he is answerable to God forces him to issue such a call to the subjects of God. He does so because he thinks that if he does not, he himself will be caught on the Day of Judgement. The natural result of such thinking is that the preacher speaks words of wisdom, gives good advice and engages in serious discussion. Exhortations to accept the Truth can be effective only when they are supported by argument and reasoning, and when they take into account the mentality of the addressees. A reasoned discourse should readily convince them of the reality of things but if it ignores their intellectual capacity, it will miss the mark and will do nothing to bolster the status of the preacher. Sympathy is a characteristic which develops in a discourse due to a well-wishing mentality (al-mu‘izah al-hasanah). When the preacher whose personality has been radically transformed by his realization of God’s majesty and glory speaks about God, the majesty of God will definitely shine through his discourse. The messenger of God who, after seeing heaven and hell, comes forward to show them to others will certainly in his discourse give glimpses of the joys of heaven and the terror of hell. The combination of these features will make his discourse so effective that it will melt hearts and bring tears to the eyes. Wisdom and good counselling are the staff of dawah work. However there are always those addressees who indulge in pointless discussions with the intention, who have no desire to understand the message but they only want to complicate matters. In such a case, the preacher must respond with gentleness; in the face of harsh words he must resort to reasoning and analysis and, in response to provocation, he must exercise patience. The eye of one who calls on others to the Truth is not on his audience but on God, who transcends all. Therefore, he utters such statements as prove to be true in God’s eyes rather than in man’s assessment."

      "text": "This verse indicates the character traits to be displayed by the dayee while facing up to his opponents. However, God says that if he is too sorely afflicted—allowing for human weakness in him as in other mortals, he is permitted to repay his tormentors in kind. But strictly speaking, the dayee is supposed to exercise patience whenever his addressees create trouble for him. Instead of adopting a retaliatory approach, he should leave all such issues to God. If the addressee does not accept the Truth, being bent rather on destroying the dayee and his mission, then the best course to be adopted by him is that of patience, i.e. avoiding reaction or retaliatory actions, he should continue conveying the message of Truth in a positive manner. The missionary has really to prove that, in fact, he is always conscious of God. If he proves this, then thereafter in all other matters, God becomes sufficient for him. After that no device of his opponents can harm him. However, strong his opponents may be. There are two kinds of human beings in this world. One is entirely focused on man and his activities, while the other is entirely focused on God. The latter see the powers of God with their own eyes. The former is never able to have control over impatience and anger. It is only the second type of person who can bear complaints and suffer bitterness and, for the sake of whatever he is going to receive from God, ignore whatever is meted out to him by his fellow men. The dayee must not have a vengeful mentality, and must abstain from retaliatory action. The conspiracies and devices of his opponents are likely to make him afraid that they may completely derail the call of Truth and destroy the preacher himself. But whatever the circumstances, he has to rely on God; he is required to have the firm belief that God sees everything and that He will support the Truth and defeat the falsehood."

On the earth, there are innumerable examples of God’s creation (animals, vegetation, rocks and minerals, etc.). The former phenomenon highlights the totally submissive aspect of creation, (musakhkharatun bi amrihi), while the latter phenomenon highlights the endless variety of creation (mukhtalifan alwanuhu). The first scene reminds man of the limitlessness of God’s power, while the second scene reminds him of the multiplicity of God’s attributes. These scenes are so wonderful that the keen-eyed observer cannot remain unaffected by them. In these things, he will see God’s majesty and His role as Sustainer; he will discover unseen realities hidden in external occurrences; by looking at God’s creations, he will be immersed in the realization of the Creator."

But if the iron is moulded in the shape of a ship, it will start floating on the surface and will be capable of carrying heavy loads and going from one country to another. This is a special law of God by means of which He has made as huge a creation as the sea subservient to man’s interests. Similarly, by a wonderful under-sea arrangement, fresh food is provided in the shape of fish and, for the ornamentation of man, valuable pearls are formed in the oysters which live in the ocean. As for the disposition of the world’s natural features, God could have made various other arrangements. For example, there might have been no oceans or seas on the earth; or man could have been made capable of walking on the sea as he walks on land. But this was not God’s way. His purpose was to create in man a feeling of gratefulness. Not being able to walk on the sea, when a man boards a boat or a ship, he experiences a sense of gratefulness; he thinks that since he is unable to traverse the sea with the help of his legs, God has been kind enough to make it traversable by means of a boat or a ship; he again thinks that since he is not able to fly in space, God has created such conditions as now permit him to fly at great speed in an aeroplane. Such divine preferences have been built into the system of nature in order to awaken man’s consciousness and to create in him feelings of gratefulness and obligation towards his Lord, the Sustainer."

For the general people, this decision will be taken on Doomsday (Judgement Day), but for the addressees of the prophet, it starts in this world itself. There is perfect unity in the universe and at the same time, there also is perfect meaningfulness. Unity in the universe makes it unwarranted for anyone to make somebody other than the one God the centre of his attention. And it is the natural consequence of its meaningfulness that it should meet a meaningful end.

Those who prove to have this sense of submission to God will be treated as successful on Judgement Day, but those who go against this will be left without hope. For the general people, this decision will be taken on Doomsday (Judgement Day), but for the addressees of the prophet, it starts in this world itself. There is perfect unity in the universe and at the same time, there also is perfect meaningfulness. Unity in the universe makes it unwarranted for anyone to make somebody other than the one God the centre of his attention. And it is the natural consequence of its meaningfulness that it should meet a meaningful end. In this way, the system governing the universe provides arguments in favour of both the unity of God (tawhid) and the existence of the Hereafter."

One of the main features of paradise is that everything is available there that a man desires. There are things there which are not available in this world to anybody —not even to the greatest kings. In the present world, due to man’s limitation and due to the unfavourable nature of external conditions, it never happens that man obtains whatever he wants. The concept that in paradise, man will find whatever he desires is of such allure that whatever sacrifice has to be made to enter paradise is negligible by comparison."

In view of this, his present behaviour can be treated as a result of the will of God. He maintains that he would not have been able to do wrong if his misdeeds had not been backed by the will of God. He says that if his actions were not to God’s liking, He would not have allowed him to continue those actions. In other words, it should have been the rule that whenever he did something against the will of God, He should have prevented him from doing it. Man talks in this way because he is not serious about truth and untruth. Had he been serious, he would have immediately understood that the liberty of action pertains to the creation plan of God according to which man is being tested in this world.

The Majesty and Power of God, which is evident in the existence of the universe, shows that God is far above any shortcomings to compensate which He would feel the necessity of creating a son or a daughter. The fact is that if God were deficient in any way, He would not have been God at all. God is God because He is entirely flawless."

If God acted in this way, nobody would be left on the face of the earth. God has given a definite period of respite (ila ajalim musamma) to every person and every community. During this period God gives man the opportunity to listen to the voice of his conscience or to an external warning and to reform himself. This applies likewise to communities. As soon as people reform themselves, all their past crimes are pardoned: it is as if they had started a new life. Just as God has taken it upon Himself not to seize upon anybody during the period of respite, He has similarly taken it upon Himself after the expiry of this period to necessarily seize upon people. After that no individual or community will be given any further opportunity for reform or repentance."

Many wrong beliefs have come into existence because God was judged to be a lesser entity than He really is. It is the result of such underestimation of God that people, though believing in God, remain fearless of Him. They form the belief about very ordinary things that these will be a source of proximity to God and that all the bounties of the Hereafter will be allotted to them as their share. The belief is entertained that a thing which does not make even an ordinary man happy, will please God. This amounts to adding arrogance to wrongdoing, which can never be pardoned by God."

Due to the concerted action of various factors, water vapours rise in the air and form clouds and again fall on the earth in the form of rain. Then this rain causes the growth of lush green cover on the earth. In this happening, there is firstly a lesson that, in this universe everywhere, the activism or workmanship of the one God is manifest. Had many gods been active here, there could not have been such wonderful coordination in the various forces of the universe that could result in such a unified harmonious process. The unity in the system of the universe is a clear proof of the fact that its Creator and its Lord is only one and not more than one. Secondly, there is the lesson that the power and majesty of God are so great that they can revivify a dead body; cause the growth of a lush green garden, and produce colour, fragrance and taste in dry and barren things. There is proof of unity in the first occurrence and the second one shows symbolically that for human souls also, there is similar godly ‘rain’, and that is ‘revelation’. One who wants to give a new life to his dead and dry soul, should have himself drenched in the rain of godly revelation."

Then it is a very strange occurrence that at the last stage of his life, a man loses his mental powers, his knowledge and his physical strength completely.

Man has no say in the above-mentioned type of events that occur in a man’s life: he is not capable of bringing about any change in them. This proves that whatever is happening is happening at the instance of some other being; man’s life as a whole, right from childhood up to his death, bears testimony to the fact that here all knowledge belongs to God and all power rests with God—man’s helplessness is the proof of the all-powerful existence of God."

In this world the division of material assets is not uniform. It is generally seen that one person has a great deal while another has so little that he is compelled to be the servant or slave of one who has plenty. Now an affluent person does not distribute his wealth among his servants in order to remove the difference between him and them. So, by analogy, it is not correct to believe that God has distributed His powers among others. Nobody denies his own greatness. Then how can God want to do something which even a man would not like to do? The fact is that a man has no possessions of his own, while the possessions of God are His own and not gifted by others. The fact is that all such beliefs are inconsistent with the image of God!"

The world has treated these events as being so insignificant that, excepting the last of the prophets (the Prophet Muhammad), there is no prophet whose work has been treated as worthy of mention in contemporary histories. But their task assumes great importance and seriousness when it is seen linked with the Hereafter. In the majestic court of the Hereafter, these very prophets and bearers of the Truth will be testifiers on behalf of God and, on the strength of their testimony, the eternal future of people will be decided. Those who, according to the testifiers, accepted the Truth and surrendered themselves in submission to it will be treated as people of paradise in the eternal world there; and those who, according to these Godly testifiers, rejected the Truth and were not willing to submit to it, will be consigned to eternal hell. If in a community or nation, true envoys of God make their appearance and that community does not accept their word, then it is a definite proof of that community’s being blameworthy. Thereafter that community loses the right to plead that they were not aware of Judgement Day, Paradise and Hell and that, as such, they should be saved from the punishment of Judgement Day."

At that time, when the worshippers of false gods see the gods whom they worshipped, they will make excuses to try to prove their innocence. In other words, they will represent these false gods as having deceived them and made them worship non-gods. But the false gods will immediately contradict this and will say, ‘This was your own arrogance. In order to avoid obedience to God, you yourself devised false gods and in their names you “proved” your self-loving religion to be legitimate.’ There are some who do not accept the call of Truth, and there are others who, further to this, try by various methods to prevent others from doing so. The first type of behaviour results from being misguided, while the second type is that of deliberate misguidance. The punishment given to misguided people will be doubled in the case of those who knowingly misguided others."

      "text": "It is the way of Almighty God that He entrusts the task of delivering warnings and of giving good news to a community through an individual selected from that very community. This is why the prophets who came to various communities were members of those communities. Now the Muslim community is required to fulfill the responsibilities of calling for the Truth and of testifying in every community till the Day of Judgement. The preachers of the various communities of this world will in the Hereafter be God’s witnesses or testifiers of those communities. It will be on the basis of their testimony that decisions will be made regarding the reward or punishment to be given to all individuals of the community. There are descriptions in the Quran of all matters of major moral and practical importance. Indeed, every revealed book which has come to mankind on behalf of God has contained such descriptions. However, the main focus is not on worldly knowledge, but on success or failure in the Hereafter. This is true of the Quran, which lays down broad principles covering the entire range of conduct which will lead to success in the Hereafter. (Neglect of these principles will lead to failure.) Those who are guided by them will merit divine blessings, while those who neglect them will only give grounds for their own destruction."

      "text": "Generally, of the various highways the traveller has to choose from, there is a recognized route by which he can go straight to his destination. But, running parallel with, or connecting to each highway, there are always many lanes and by-ways. If the traveller chooses to drive along one of the latter, thinking he is on the right road, he will never reach his destination, but will stray many miles to the right or left of it. The same is true of reaching God. God has already shown man which way will lead to Him. This is the way of the Unity of God (tawhid) and the fear of God (taqwa). One who follows this path will reach God and one who goes another way will be lost by the wayside; he will never be able to reach his Lord. Everything in the world treads the path fixed by God. Had God so wished, man also would have been compelled to follow the path fixed by God. But the scheme of the creation of man is different from that of the creation of other things. Other things are required only to follow a regulatory discipline. But in the case of man, what is required is voluntary obedience to this discipline. The result of there being this opportunity to voluntarily submit to regulation is that while one person will take the right path, another will leave it and become lost on paths of his own devising."

      "text": "How a subject of God should live in the world has been clearly described in this verse. In view of its importance, Caliph ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul ‘Aziz included this verse in the weekly sermon. The first thing an individual must ensure is that justice (‘adal) is done. This means that whatever right one person has over another should be fully discharged, be the claimant weak or strong. In the fulfillment of rights, only the nature of the right will be considered and not any other factors. The next thing is showing consideration (ihsan). This means that while honouring rights, one should be broadminded. Human consideration should be added to the demands of justice. One should exhibit generosity and sympathy beyond the legal requirement. Man should have the courage as far as possible to reconcile with whatever is rightfully due to him and try to give to others more than is rightfully their due. The third thing is ‘giving their due to near relatives’ (wa i’ta zil qurba). This means that just as a man becomes anxious when he sees his wife and children in need and fulfills that need, he should be similarly sensitive about the needs of others who are close to him. No well-to-do person should behave as if only he himself and the members of his household are entitled to his property: he should also include in his responsibilities the fulfillment of the rights of his relatives. After this three things have been prohibited in this verse. The first thing is moral evil (fahsha’) which is clearly judged to be such by the human conscience and universally considered shameful. The second is the perpetration of such deeds as are judged improper by common moral standards. This includes all those things which are considered as evil by man and which man’s nature refuses to accept. Munkar is the opposite of ma‘ruf. Ma‘ruf consists of such things as are considered good in every society. The third thing is transgressing all limits (baghi). This includes arrogance when a man exceeds his recognized limit and attacks another person; his engaging in sinful behaviour in order to harm another’s life, property and honour; his making use of his strength and influence to gain an illegitimate advantage."

      "text": "The spinning of cotton involves the hard work of combining separate fibres so that articles useful to man may be woven from it. If someone spins cotton, working hard the whole day, but in the evening tears the spun thread to pieces, then the entire hard work will go waste. The same is true of those who enter into a mutual agreement and one or the other party breaks it without any valid reason. Shredding the cotton thread after spinning it amounts to wasting one’s labour. Similarly, the breaking of an executed agreement nullifies the whole process by which a matter of mutual unity had come into existence. In the present world a man spends his life along with other human beings. Every man has to do his work among many other men. For this reason, great importance is given to mutual confidence and trust. In order to maintain this collective social life, agreements and decisions between one man and another man are frequently entered into, sometimes by oath and sometimes without an oath. Now, if people start breaking such agreements without any real justification, social life will be greatly disturbed and constructive development of any kind will no longer be possible. There are two ways of making an agreement in the name of God. In one case a pledge is made formally, uttering the words of the oath. In the second case the words of the oath are not uttered, but reference to God in some form is included in the agreement executed. In all such cases the undertakers of oaths are as if making God the witness or surety in the matter. The breaking of an agreement in which the name of God is also included is much more serious, because this shows that it is only when a man needs to win the confidence of others that he makes use of God’s name, but when he is overcome by the requirements of his own interests, he ignores God. There are two types of agreements between individuals or communities—one is based on principles, and the other is based on interest. In ancient times, the position was that whenever there appeared to be any advantage in making  such an agreement, it was executed, but whenever it seemed beneficial to break it, it was broken. Things are no different today. As opposed to this, Islam requires that agreements should be subject to the principles of Islamic law and morality."

      "text": "There are unfathomable aspects of this world. Truth and untruth are not separate and distinct. The reason for this is to be found in the plan of God by which He created this world, a plan designed to ascertain the true moral fibre of each and every individual on this earth. Indeed, man has been brought into this present world for the purpose of being tested. This purpose would not have been served had man not been given the freedom to accept or reject God’s word. He had to have the freedom to show truth to be untruth and to present untruth in the shape of truth. If God had not had this in view, he would have subjected all human beings to His orders, just as He did with the rest of the universe. This state of affairs will be perpetuated till the Day of Judgement. On the Day of Judgement it will be clear as to who used his judgement correctly, and who ignored the Truth for the sake of self-interest. At that time God will mete out to each individual such treatment as will be commensurate with his or her performance during the period of trial in the present world."

If Muslims enter into transactions involving agreements with others and thereafter, without any real reason and only for the sake of self-interest, break them, this will result in destroying the moral credibility of Muslims in general. This will create an atmosphere such as will discourage others from adopting the way of God. Ibn Kathir writes that when a rejecter of Islam sees that a Muslim has entered into an agreement, but goes against it, he will have no faith in the religion of Islam and will abstain from embracing the religion of God. The act of breaking an agreement against the principles of Islamic law inevitably occurs when one partner to it sees that he will receive certain worldly benefits by doing so. But a believer’s view is Hereafter-oriented. Whenever it is the self which makes a move to break the agreement, the person concerned curbs his self by saying that there may be some worldly benefit in breaking it, but he will gain no advantage thereby in the Hereafter. And the advantage of the Hereafter is definitely greater than any worldly benefit."
