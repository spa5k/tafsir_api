The message that he gave to the corrupted people of those days has been put here in three words—worship (‘ibadah), fear of God (taqwa) and obedience to the Prophet (ita‘ah), i.e. the worshipping of God and renouncing the worship of anything other than God, leading one’s life in the world with the fear of God in one’s heart and considering the prophet of God an example to be followed in all matters. This has been the real message of all prophets in every age and this is the true message of the Quran itself."

The fact is that this acceptance of God’s greatness is the real standard of God-worship. One who is living in the knowledge of the Majesty of God is a real God-worshipper, while one whose heart is not immersed in God’s greatness is not a true believer."

One of these was to spread it about that Noah was against their great ones of old, viz., Wadd, Suwa‘, Yauq, Yaghuth and Nasr. All of them had been of great piety in ancient times. Gradually they became sanctified and ultimately people started worshipping them. It was easy to turn the people against Noah in the name of these men. So, they made Noah’s mission look dubious to the people by saying that he was treading a new path, straying from the path of their revered forebears."
