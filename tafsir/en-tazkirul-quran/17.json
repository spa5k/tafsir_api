      "text": "One year before the migration (hijrah) of the Prophet Muhammad to Madinah, the conditions at Makkah were extremely adverse. It looked as if the history of Islam might come to an end even before it could take any definite shape. At that very juncture, God arranged to show the Prophet a very great sign—a demonstration, in fact, that Islamic history would not only run its due course, but that certain conditions would also be created to ensure that what it brought to the world would be preserved and thus remain eternally alive. This was because it had to become the authentic source of God’s religion for all nations till the Day of Judgement. God so willed that the Prophet Muhammad be taken from Makkah to al-Masjid al-Aqsa in Palestine (Jerusalem). This was the first stage of a journey (mi‘raj), which was spiritual rather than physical, in nature. Here, at al-Masjid al-Aqsa, God had also gathered all the previous prophets. Together, they engaged in congregational prayer, with the Prophet Muhammad leading them. This instance of the Prophet Muhammad leading the prayer symbolized God’s decision that the shariah of the previous prophets were no longer an authentic source of divine guidance. Now, all the nations should have to draw upon the religion presented by the Prophet Muhammad in order to have the authentic knowledge of God’ religion. For this important happening, which came to be known as The Night Journey, or isra’, Palestine was the most suitable place, its having been the centre from which the majority of the previous prophets had issued their call of Truth. Hence God’s selection of this particular area to announce His decision."

      "text": "The Quran calls upon all human beings to accept the Oneness of God, or tawhid, that is, belief in the one God and surrender to His will. It can truly be said that no other matter can be more correct, more reasonable and more natural. Undoubtedly, the Oneness of God is the greatest reality and also the greatest truth. This position of the Oneness of God necessarily makes it the standard by which all human beings should be tested and the basis on which some should be treated as right and others as wrong, some as successful and others as failures. But, in the present world this standard is seemingly not upheld and the testing of human beings is not, apparently, done on this basis. But this is due only to God’s hidden way of applying His law of testing. For individuals, death, and for the general mass of the people, the Day of Judgement are the final limits of the test period. As soon as this limit is reached, human beings will be separated into two different groups: those who believed in one God in the full sense, and met all the demands of that belief, will find themselves in paradise, while those who did not, will find themselves in hell."

      "text": "Man is narrow-minded. He wants to build up all kinds of status for himself or for his group. If the distribution of all kinds of blessings had been in the hands of man, surely the rich and the powerful would in addition have reserved prophethood for themselves. But God sees everything in terms of merit rather than community biases. He looks at all human beings and selects the best person out of the entire human race for prophethood. Had prophethood been conferred by human beings, their choice would certainly have been characterised by communal biases and prejudices rather than by merit."

The virtuous people mentioned in this verse are the People of the Book. They had learnt from their ancient divine scriptures that a final prophet was going to come, and that those who believed in him and supported him, would be held deserving of special divine succour. Therefore, they had been eagerly waiting for the advent of the final prophet. That is why they took no time in recognizing the Prophet Muhammad.

      "text": "The system of night and day shows that it is the way of God that there should be darkness first and, thereafter, light should take its place. In God’s eyes, both of them are equally important. Just as there are benefits in light, similarly, there are benefits in darkness. If there were no distinction between night and day, how would man allocate his time and how would he alternate work with rest? Man should neither be afraid of darkness, nor should he constantly hanker after light, because eternal light is not possible in this world of God. One whose desires are such had better leave this world and go in search of another world. It is strange that this is the greatest weakness of man: he never wants to have to face any period of darkness, but immediately wants to have light. His undue haste is a sign of this weakness. Haste is, in fact, the equivalent of not reconciling with the plan of God. And not reconciling with the plan of God is the real cause of all human destruction. God wants man to be patient about acquiring the immediate luxuries of the world, so that he should keep to the right path on his journey towards the Hereafter. But man, due to his hasty nature, rushes to acquire ephemeral worldly luxuries, which prove to be impediments to his continuing his onward journey. Man’s desire for instant gratification is the greatest reason for his being deprived of the bounties of the Hereafter. This is likewise true of the world, where real success is achieved by means of patience and not by a hasty approach. The Prophet Jeremiah advised the Jews that they should recognize the political domination of the King of Babylon for the present, and in the initial stage devote their efforts to constructive work and the preaching of God’s word. He said that thereafter a time would come when Almighty God would give them the means of achieving domination and power. But, in their impatience, the Jews were not willing to accept his advice. Eager to enter the stage of ‘light’ before passing through the stage of ‘darkness’, they immediately started a political struggle against the King of Babylon. Since, in accordance with the system of God, it was not possible for them to succeed, only dishonour and degradation awaited them."

Some hold that God should be called by one name, others by another name. Some hold that the words of devotions should be uttered loudly, others that they be uttered quietly. The Arabs were engaged in such debates and discussions in different ways. God said that all His names were good. He might be called by any of His names. Similarly, acts of devotion are not to be judged by quiet or loud utterances, but rather by the spirit they evince. The spirit of prayer is one of a deep consciousness of God’s greatness. Belief in God should become akin to discovering a perfect and great Being, who is independent of any help from anyone; who has no equal and no partner. When this discovery finds words and comes to the lips of the believer, it is called celebration of God’s greatness (takbir)."

On the other hand, there is the way of infinite love of truth, the credit for which man will receive only when he begins his life after death. If a man has a grievance, one way of dealing with it is to become vindictive and vengeful. The other option is to forgive and, offering prayers to God, leave the whole matter in His hands. Similarly, man may spend his wealth in fulfilling his desires and furthering his ambitions, or he may spend it for the cause of God. Likewise, there are two different ways of dealing with life’s contingencies: one is to fulfil one’s own desires, while the other is to dedicate oneself to the worship of God.

      "text": "The implication of the above-mentioned event was that the Children of Israel, the Jews, were deposed from the position of the ‘bearers of the Scriptures’ in favour of the Children of Ishmael (Banu Isma‘il). This event took place in accordance with the way of God, who has always chosen a particular group for the declaration of the truth. This is the greatest honour one can have in this world. However, this selection is not based on race or community. A group is entitled to this honour only if it is able to demonstrate the necessary competence. The moment its competence becomes questionable, it must forgo its entitlement to this honour. This happened in the case of the respective communities of Adam, Noah, Moses, and Jesus—without exception. This is the law of God, moreover, for any future community and there can be no exception to it for anyone. To qualify for this position, the chosen group must treat God as the sole guardian, (wakil), and, placing their full trust in the one and only God, should leave all their affairs to Him. When man discovers God in all His majesty and power, it is but natural that he should make God his guardian. One who attains the true realization of God will make God his everything, and will lead the life of a true believer in the present world. In order to lead such a life, man has to find God as the greatest reality, that is, the Creator and Lord of all creation. Moreover, only those who attain this status in the realization of God can properly discharge the responsibility of calling upon others to the truth. To preach the word of God, it is absolutely necessary to be completely selfless, for total concentration cannot be developed in a man unless all his hopes and fears are attached to God; God should be his everything."

Similarly, the more one is involved in Hereafter-oriented activities, the greater the reward one will receive in the Hereafter. Furthermore, whatever one receives in the next world will be eternal, while whatever one receives in this world will be ephemeral in nature."

This means that when one acknowledges one’s helplessness vis-à-vis the greatness of God, one does so out of choice rather than as a result of some visible compulsion. In this respect, the case of elderly parents is somewhat similar in nature to that of God. The parents have no material power over their children. When the children treat their parents well, they do it of their own free will and not because of any material pressures. This is the real test of man in the present world. Here he has to adopt the way of truth and justice, without being forced to do so. He has to perform of his own free will and at his pleasure such deeds as he would perform if God appeared before him in all His Omnipotence. Such voluntary action poses a serious test for man. However, God has made it easy for man by his special Grace. He does not test man with the severity of a master who becomes overly exercised about petty things. If a man is basically loyal to God, He excuses his petty lapses. If a man turns over a new leaf after doing something wrong, He pardons him, regardless of how great a sin he may have committed."

This event took place in accordance with the way of God, who has always chosen a particular group for the declaration of the truth. This is the greatest honour one can have in this world. However, this selection is not based on race or community. A group is entitled to this honour only if it is able to demonstrate the necessary competence. The moment its competence becomes questionable, it must forgo its entitlement to this honour. This happened in the case of the respective communities of Adam, Noah, Moses, and Jesus—without exception. This is the law of God, moreover, for any future community and there can be no exception to it for anyone. To qualify for this position, the chosen group must treat God as the sole guardian, (wakil), and, placing their full trust in the one and only God, should leave all their affairs to Him. When man discovers God in all His majesty and power, it is but natural that he should make God his guardian. One who attains the true realization of God will make God his everything, and will lead the life of a true believer in the present world. In order to lead such a life, man has to find God as the greatest reality, that is, the Creator and Lord of all creation. Moreover, only those who attain this status in the realization of God can properly discharge the responsibility of calling upon others to the truth. To preach the word of God, it is absolutely necessary to be completely selfless, for total concentration cannot be developed in a man unless all his hopes and fears are attached to God; God should be his everything."

In view of this, man’s action in killing anyone on the pretext of a lack of the means to survive amounts to committing a totally unjustifiable act. When God Himself undertakes the sustenance of all His creatures, nobody has the right to kill anybody for fear that another’s continuing to exist will reduce his own chances of survival. ‘It is We who provide (sustenance) for them, and for you.’ Through these words the thinking of man is directed towards construction rather than destruction. It is worth considering that if human beings at present can earn their livelihood, it is by their utilizing the productive resources provided by God. This will hold good for future generations also."

One who is killed without the justification of the Islamic law must be regarded as having been wronged. In view of this, the surviving kin of the deceased have full rights over the killer; they may avenge the murder as per the law; or they may let the killer go, after taking compensation from him; or they may forgive him altogether. According to Islamic law, the real claimants are the surviving kin of the dead person and not the government. The duty of the government is only to help the surviving kin to enforce their will. Murder is such a terrible crime that it is said in a tradition of the Prophet Muhammad that the killing of a human being is more undesirable that the annihilation of the whole world. In the eyes of God, this principle notwithstanding, the surviving relatives of the murdered person have no right to commit any excess on the killer in the avenging of the murder. They may not, for instance, disfigure the killer or kill one of his companions in his place, etc. If the surviving relatives of the killed person commit any excess in avenging the murder, in this case the government may step in to prevent this, in exactly the same manner as it would have assisted them in securing their right to retributive justice, or qisas. This reveals the spirit of Islamic law: if a person, howsoever oppressed, wants to take revenge, he is allowed to do so only in proportion to the degree of oppression he has suffered. He is in no way allowed to take any action in excess of this."

Keeping promises is a sign of nobility of character. One, who makes a pledge, but does not fulfill it, is a worthless person before God and men. Literally ‘a pledge must be accounted for to God’. These words make it quite clear that if one man makes a promise to another, it does not concern just the two of them: God actively participates in the capacity of the third party.

The details of the first instance of corruption are found in the Old Testament books of Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The details of the second instance of corruption are found in the words of Jesus in the New Testament in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. The Prophet Muhammad was taken from Makkah to al-Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, in order to be shown ‘the sign of God.’ One of these signs is also the history associated with al-Masjid al-Aqsa. The above verse just means a place of worship situated at a distance. It is called the farthest place of worship, because it was situated at a distance of 765 miles from Makkah. Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, in this context, refers to the Jewish place of worship, that is, the Haykal Synagogue. This Jewish synagogue, built by Solomon in 957 BC, was razed to the ground in 586 BC by the king of Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzar II. After a long period of time, the Jews rebuilt their place of worship. This was gain reduced to ruins in AD 70 by the Romans. This history is a manifestation of God’s Law which lays down that if a community entrusted with the Holy Scriptures discharges the obligations attached to them, then it is given a high status in this world, as well as success in the Hereafter. If it fails to do so, it is made subject to oppressive communities, which make it a victim of their tyranny and exploitation. The manifestation of this law has occurred again and again in the case of former bearers of the scriptures. Two important events of direct relevance have been referred to here, so that a lesson may be taken from them. In the beginning God blessed the Children of Israel and delivered them from the Pharaoh’s tyranny and permitted them to occupy Palestine and establish their rule there. But then, corruption set in among the Jews. They started engaging in polytheistic practices, became the victims of differences and schisms, and separated into different groups. As a result of this repeated disobedience to God, the Children of Israel had to submit to Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, who established his dominion over Palestine. Thereafter, he chose a member of the royal family of the Jews and appointed him as his representative to rule over them. But, the Jews, considering this subordinate state damaging to their national pride, rebelled against it. This was despite being advised against rebellion by one of their prophets, Jeremiah. The King of Babylon became so incensed that once again, in 486 B.C., he attacked Palestine with all his military might. The Jews were not only totally defeated, but their temple in Jerusalem, which was the last sign of their glory, was also completely demolished."

Secondly, if the partner is taken to be God’s son, —who, in the experience of man is a symbol of power and strength—this again would defy understanding, for, power is indivisible. If in any system there is more than one person invested with power, a struggle between them is bound to take place, for each one of them would want to have absolute power. Now, if there had been more than one powerful being in this universe, there would certainly have been a struggle for power and this would have created disorder and dissension. But, as there is no disorder or dissension in the universe, this proves that no such being or beings exist as have a share in God’s power. Whether God’s supposed partners are called sons or daughters, the notion of partnership clashes with reality. The truth is that the entire universe rejects all ideas that ascribe partners to God’s divinity."

The details of the first instance of corruption are found in the Old Testament books of Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The details of the second instance of corruption are found in the words of Jesus in the New Testament in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. The Prophet Muhammad was taken from Makkah to al-Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, in order to be shown ‘the sign of God.’ One of these signs is also the history associated with al-Masjid al-Aqsa. The above verse just means a place of worship situated at a distance. It is called the farthest place of worship, because it was situated at a distance of 765 miles from Makkah. Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, in this context, refers to the Jewish place of worship, that is, the Haykal Synagogue. This Jewish synagogue, built by Solomon in 957 BC, was razed to the ground in 586 BC by the king of Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzar II. After a long period of time, the Jews rebuilt their place of worship. This was gain reduced to ruins in AD 70 by the Romans. This history is a manifestation of God’s Law which lays down that if a community entrusted with the Holy Scriptures discharges the obligations attached to them, then it is given a high status in this world, as well as success in the Hereafter. If it fails to do so, it is made subject to oppressive communities, which make it a victim of their tyranny and exploitation. The manifestation of this law has occurred again and again in the case of former bearers of the scriptures. Two important events of direct relevance have been referred to here, so that a lesson may be taken from them. In the beginning God blessed the Children of Israel and delivered them from the Pharaoh’s tyranny and permitted them to occupy Palestine and establish their rule there. But then, corruption set in among the Jews. They started engaging in polytheistic practices, became the victims of differences and schisms, and separated into different groups. As a result of this repeated disobedience to God, the Children of Israel had to submit to Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, who established his dominion over Palestine. Thereafter, he chose a member of the royal family of the Jews and appointed him as his representative to rule over them. But, the Jews, considering this subordinate state damaging to their national pride, rebelled against it. This was despite being advised against rebellion by one of their prophets, Jeremiah. The King of Babylon became so incensed that once again, in 486 B.C., he attacked Palestine with all his military might. The Jews were not only totally defeated, but their temple in Jerusalem, which was the last sign of their glory, was also completely demolished."

However provocative the addressees may be, the preacher has been commanded to exercise patience and refrain from repaying in the same coin. For, if he is provoked by the addressees’ ill behaviour, an atmosphere of hatred and obstinacy will develop. This tension between the preacher and the addressees might make it impossible for the latter to take his message cool-mindedly, with an open and unbiased mind. Any atmosphere of hatred and obstinacy between the preacher and the addressees favours Satan, who is thus able to make the call of truth unpalatable to the addressees. Therefore, if the preacher through any of his actions becomes responsible for producing a feeling of defiance and hatred, it is as if he were playing into the hands of Satan. It is like doing the enemy’s job oneself."

Similarly, it happens sometimes that the preacher and the addressees engage in arguments regarding which of their respective prophets is the superior one. The energies of each side are then spent on proving that their own prophet enjoys a higher status with God, with the result that the discussion, which should have been focused on the principles of the prophet’s message, is instead focused on personalities. This awakens in them feelings of prejudice and, as a result, places further obstacles in the path of the acceptance of the truth. Hence the explanation given in these verses that it is a matter pertaining to God as to what status He grants to His servants.

The first kind was in the nature of general help offered to a prophet and his companions. This help was like a support from God. The second kind was that taking place at the demand of polytheists, namely, miracles. The Prophet Muhammad—the last Prophet—and his Companions were given divine succour on a number of occasions. But the miracles, given to the previous prophets, were not given to Prophet Muhammad inspite of the demands of his contemporaries. The reason was that everything has certain demands: those who demand extraordinary signs will have extraordinary responsibility given to them too. Furthermore, according to the law of God, those who do not accept faith, even after being shown such extraordinary signs as miracles, are subsequently destroyed, having invited God’s wrath and proved themselves deserving of God’s scourge. Now, since the Prophet Muhammad was the last Prophet and prophethood was going to be terminated with him, his addressees could not be dealt with in like manner, for in that case the entire community would have been wiped out by the divine scourge. Who would have remained then in the world to represent the Prophet? It was God’s special mercy to the addressees of the last Prophet that in spite of their demands, they were not given tangible miracles. Had their demands been acceded to, they too—after their denial—would have faced the same fate as that of the Thamud community."

In answer to their demand for tangible miracles the Quran had this to say: ‘Is this miracle not enough to open their eyes?’ i.e. in the initial stages of conveying the word of God when the Prophet apparently had no power, it was declared that mankind had been encircled by God. This statement was corroborated with the spreading of Islam among the Arab tribes. It saw its completion with the victory of Badr, and the conquest of Makkah after the Hudaybiyyah Peace Treaty. Similarly, when the Prophet Muhammad announced on the morning following the Night Journey that the previous night he had been taken from the Ka‘bah to al-Bayt al-Maqdis, people did not believe him. His opponents summoned those individuals who had actually seen al-Bayt al-Maqdis and the Prophet was then asked to describe the details of the building. This he did with great accuracy. Still these happenings were not taken seriously. They scoffed at them, demanding proof of his veracity in the shape of miracles. The truth is that the actual problem is not one of showing tangible miracles but rather of serious thinking about the mission. When people are not serious about the divine call, they make a mockery of everything, even if it is of great importance. When the Quran warned that in hell people would have to eat the fruit of the Zaqqum tree (\n37:62\n), Abu Jahal called for dates and butter to be brought, and asked others to eat them, saying that that was what Zaqqum was. (Tafsir ibn Kathir). The fruits of this tree will serve as food for the inhabitants of hell. When this verse was revealed in the Quran, one of the leaders of the Quraysh remarked, ‘Look at Abu Kabsha’s son, he warns us of a hell which will burn up everything in it, even the stones. Then how does he think that a tree can grow in that fire? We all know that fire burns everything.’ (At-Tafsir al-Mazhari)."

Accepting the godhead of God is monotheism (tawhid), while acceptance of beings and things other than God as the godhead is polytheism (shirk). What God desires from man is nothing other than acknowledgement. But man is so insolent that he is not willing to bow to God’s will, even to this minimum extent."

They were then given divine assistance through the agency of Cyrus, the King of Iran, who attacked and captured Babylon in 539 B.C., having defeated its ruler. Cyrus showed his favour to the Jews by allowing them to leave Babylon and return to their native place, Palestine. There, after a long time, they constructed their temple once again. However, the corruption, which had prevailed in the previous generation of the Jews, began to set in in the new generation also. In the meantime, they faced many vicissitudes. Their own prophets, John the Baptist and Jesus, who rose from among them, criticized their behaviour, revealing the irreligiousness they indulged in in the name of religion. This enraged the Jews. They went so far as to kill John the Baptist and were prepared to crucify Jesus. Then the wrath of God descended upon them once again. In the year 70 A.C., the Roman King, Titus, attacked Jerusalem and destroyed it completely. The Jews recognize these events as a part of their history, but when they mention these historical facts, they attribute them to the oppression of tyrants. The Quran, however, very clearly attributes them to the behaviour of the People of the Book themselves. This shows that political conditions are always subject to moral conditions. No tyrant oppresses any community unless the corruption of the religious and moral conditions of that community gives him the opportunity to do so, i.e. it allows him to make them his victims."

When the moon and the stars have not been endowed with consciousness, why has man been given consciousness and will power? Man exploits everything on this earth—trees, mineral ores, animals—but has the power to prevent any other creature from exploiting him. The animals have to rely upon their teeth, horns and hooves to do things with, but man makes tools and machines to achieve his ends. The only possible thing for a river to do is flow downwards, following the slope of the land over which it passes, while man can climb to any height, having the power to travel up or down, in any direction he wishes. Man has been provided for on a large scale in this world. The tree leaves convert solar energy into chemical energy in order to prepare food for man. Cows eat grass in order that they may return it in the form of milk. The honeybee is engaged in hectic activities day in and day out, sucking the nectar of the flowers from all around it to transform it into precious honey for man, etc. All these gifts of God to man demand that he should become His grateful servant. But he shows little if any gratitude to his Maker."

Such a preacher is all alone, without any powerful supports, unlike those occupying high religious positions. This difference results in misunderstanding, so that those in power come to regard the preacher as a totally worthless person. They even go to the extent of wanting to expel him from their town or city. Such people tend to forget that this earth has been created by God. Therefore, trying to harm the preacher of truth amounts to proving themselves sinners in God’s eyes. Moreover, expelling God’s preacher from any human settlement is the equivalent of expelling a representative of the government of the time. Such an expulsion serves only to condemn the expeller. Whenever a man wants to belittle another, it is he himself who is belittled in the eyes of the Lord of the world. For it is the Lord who has the actual power to elevate His creatures in status or lay them low."

      "text": "Tahajjud, literally means keeping a vigil at night. The spirit of the tahajjud prayer is remembrance of God in the hours of solitude, i.e. during the night. When a man has slept for a short time, and gets up feeling refreshed, that is the best hour. When he directs his attention to God with full devotion and recites God’s words in the form of prayer during this hour, it is as if he were the epitome of devoutness. When his mind is fully concentrated on the prayer, his entire personality is so engaged that this strong attachment to God makes its way through his eyes. The high status of the Prophet (maqam mahmud) has two aspects, one pertaining to this world and the other pertaining to the hereafter. In the latter case it is linked by the commentators with the Great Intercession. As we learn from traditions, all the prophets will intercede, by the will of God, on the Day of Judgement on behalf of the believers. This intercession will be a testament to their being true believers, and only after this intercession by the prophets will the believers who have been awarded Paradise by God be admitted to Paradise. The Prophet Muhammad will be the Intercessor for the largest group, for his followers will be greater in number than any other. The worldly aspect of this exalted status of the Prophet Muhammad is his being acknowledged and acclaimed by the nations of the world on account of his having become a historical prophet. Indeed, the divine plan saw its completion with his prophethood; today the people of the world are compelled to acknowledge him as a prophet of God. His prophethood has become an established fact, instead of being the subject of controversy as it was during the early period of his prophetic career. That is to say, it is a prophethood in favour of which so much historical proof has accumulated that no room is left for doubt regarding the personality and teachings of the Prophet. Man, by his own established academic standard, is compelled to accept his prophetic position. The ultimate form of that acknowledgement and acceptance is praise. That is why such a status is described as exalted."

      "text": "‘The Spirit’ here means divine revelation. The Arabs who used to question the Prophet were not deniers of revelation. Their questions arose not out of their ignorance of the fact that God reveals His message to His prophets, but out of their ignorance of the Prophet, that is, not considering him worthy of receiving divine revelation. It was at a time when history had not yet created an aura of greatness around the Prophet. He appeared to people like a common man, so they could not believe that the angel would come to him with God’s words, and if they questioned him, it was only to scoff at him. However, in answer to this question the Quran gives us a very important principle, that is, that man has been granted only a little knowledge, and not complete knowledge. That is why realism demands that he refrain from embroiling himself in such questions as he cannot answer because of his natural limitations. In ancient times man could see only with his naked eye. So observation by the eye could work only over a specific distance, which is not enough to study the truth. For instance, something which appears from a distance to be a single object turns out to be two when we come closer to it. Since so many gadgets have become available in latter times, man has come to look upon them as remedies for his limitations. He thinks that by means of these gadgets, things can be observed to the fullest possible extent. But when man reached the twentieth century this misunderstanding came to an end. Then he learnt that things were far more complex and mysterious than were imagined, even with the aid of these gadgets. This being so, remaining content with limited knowledge is now the demand of realism, not just the demand of some creed. During the age of Newton, the world of scientific research was limited to the macro world. In those times, it was held that all things of the world, in their ultimate analysis, were a combination of atoms and the atom was something which could be weighed and measured. In the light of this theory, it was believed that anything that could be weighed and measured or was tangible had any real existence. Consequently an unseen God could not be believed in at a scientific level. However in the 20th century in the era of Einstein, with the splitting of the atom, human knowledge reached the micro world from the macro world. Now it was demonstrated that the atom was composed of electrons and protons, which were nothing but intangible waves or energy which could not be seen. It could be apprehended only by means of indirect effect or by inference. Therefore, unobservable things that could be proved by inference also came to be considered as having a real existence. This led to the belief in the argument from design. “Where there is a design (Universe) there is a Designer”. It was thus accepted that if we could see the effect of God, His design, or the Universe, we had to ultimately believe in the existence of the Designer or the Maker of the universe. Our capacities are limited, but the world beyond us is unlimited. It is impossible for the limited to grasp the unlimited. Human limitation demands that man should remain content with indirect knowledge, and stop insisting on direct knowledge. In other words, knowledge acquired by indirect methods should be regarded as being as valid as that acquired by observation."

God has created man as a conscious being and throughout the entire universe, this consciousness is a unique phenomenon—a gift by which man may recognise the truth by his own powers of reasoning, rather than wait to be convinced by miracles. The truth is that in the present world man is being tested at the level of argument. Here, everyone has to recognise truth in the language of reasoning and argument and adopt it as such. Those who cannot recognize truth in this way are the ones who will be failures."

      "text": "The Quran calls upon all human beings to accept the Oneness of God, or tawhid, that is, belief in the one God and surrender to His will. It can truly be said that no other matter can be more correct, more reasonable and more natural. Undoubtedly, the Oneness of God is the greatest reality and also the greatest truth. This position of the Oneness of God necessarily makes it the standard by which all human beings should be tested and the basis on which some should be treated as right and others as wrong, some as successful and others as failures. But, in the present world this standard is seemingly not upheld and the testing of human beings is not, apparently, done on this basis. But this is due only to God’s hidden way of applying His law of testing. For individuals, death, and for the general mass of the people, the Day of Judgement are the final limits of the test period. As soon as this limit is reached, human beings will be separated into two different groups: those who believed in one God in the full sense, and met all the demands of that belief, will find themselves in paradise, while those who did not, will find themselves in hell."

The cause of this astonishment is traceable to the fact that before him is the ‘great’ Prophet as he is known today, while the deniers of the first phase had before them a contemporary prophet who was at that time just Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah, as yet with no glorious history to commend him. A prophet to his contemporaries appears to be only a human being like any other, but later on, with the accumulation of historical proofs regarding his prophethood, people have no doubt about his being a real prophet. That is why all the prophets have been rejected by their contemporaries, save a tiny minority, while the next generation had no reason not to acknowledge their greatness. Since man is in a state of trial in the present world, he will never be informed of the truth through the angels. Such a communication of the truth would mean unveiling reality to the ultimate extent. If reality were to be unveiled in this way, how would man be put to the test?"

The latter are those who do not properly use their eyes, ears, or tongues: they use these things against the very purpose of creation, then they blissfully imagine that their actions will have no consequences in the Hereafter."

When this initial creation is possible, why should there not be a second creation? The truth is that after accepting the first creation, no scientific, rational argument comes in the way of believing in the second creation. In the face of such clear evidence, anyone who does not accept the second creation is a transgressor. He treads on the ground of stubbornness instead of on the ground of reason and rationality."
