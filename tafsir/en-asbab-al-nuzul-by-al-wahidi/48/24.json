Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdIsa ibn \ufffdAmrawayh\u003e Ibrahim ibn Muhammad\u003e Muslim\u003e \ufffdAmr al-Naqid\u003e Yazid ibn Harun\u003e Hammad ibn Salamah\u003e Thabit\u003e Anas who reported that eighty men from Mecca came down mount al-Tan\ufffdim intending to take on the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and his Companions by surprise. However, he captured them and spared their lives, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And He it is Who hath withheld men\ufffds hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them, after He had made you victors over them). \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mughaffal al-Muzani said: \ufffdWe were with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, at al-Hudaybiyyah close to the base of the tree which was mentioned in the Qur\ufffdan when thirty armed youths suddenly charged on us. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, prayed against them, and Allah, exalted is He, took away their sight. We then bounced on them and seized them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked them: \ufffdHave you come under the protection of someone? Has anyone given you a guarantee of safety?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo, by Allah!\ufffd He let them go after which Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And He it is Who hath withheld men\ufffds hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them\ufffd)\ufffd."
