  "text": "(O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are enemies for you, therefor beware of them. And if ye efface and overlook and forgive, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) [64:14]. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdSome men used to embrace Islam but, upon trying to migrate, were prevented from doing so by their families and children. The latter would plead with them, saying: \ufffdWe plead with you, by Allah, not to leave your family and clan and depart to Medina where you have no family or wealth\ufffd. Some of these men took pity on their family and children and stayed back, thus failing to migrate, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Ahmad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Fadl Ahmad ibn Isma\ufffdil ibn Yahya ibn Hazim\u003e \ufffdUmar ibn Muhammad ibn Bujayr\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdUmar al-Maqdimi\u003e Ash\ufffdath ibn \ufffdAbd Allah\u003e Shu\ufffdbah\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn Abi Khalid who said: \ufffdSome men used to embrace Islam but then faced the rebuke of their families and children, and so this verse was revealed (O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are enemies for you, therefor beware of them\ufffd)\ufffd. Reporting from Ibn \ufffdAbbas, \ufffdIkrimah said: \ufffdThis refers to those who were prevented by their families from emigrating to Medina. When they finally migrated and saw that people had gained a clear understanding of the religion, they were about to punish those members of their family who prevented them from migrating, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And if ye efface and overlook and forgive, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful)\ufffd."
