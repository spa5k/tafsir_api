Abu Sa'id informed us\u003e Ibn Abi 'Amr al-Naysaburi\u003e al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Makhladi\u003e al-Mu'ammil ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Isa\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Abu Hudhayfah\u003e Sufyan\u003e al-Zubayr ibn 'Adiyy\u003e 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla\u003e Ka'b ibn 'Ujrah who said: \ufffdIt was said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: 'We know how to salute you, but how do we invoke blessings on you?' And so this verse was revealed (Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation)\ufffd. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Hamdan al-'Adl informed us\u003e Abu'l-'Abbas Ahmad ibn 'Isa al-Washsha'\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Suli\u003e al-Riyashi\u003e al-Asma'i who said: \ufffdI heard al-Mahdi say from the pulpit of [the grand mosque of] al-Basrah: 'Allah has commanded you with something that He Himself has started first when He said (Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation). Through this, Allah has preferred the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, over all other messengers and singled you out from all other communities. Do, therefore, meet Allah's bounty with gratitude' \ufffd. I heard master Abu 'Uthman al-Hafiz say that he heard Imam Sahl ibn Muhammad ibn Sulayman say: \ufffdThe honour that Allah, exalted is He, bestowed upon our Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, by His saying (Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet) is more far-reaching and more complete than the honour bestowed upon Adam, peace be upon him, when the angels were ordered to prostrate to him. This is because it is not conceivable that Allah be with the angels upon the bestowal of that honour. However, Allah, exalted is He, has informed that He Himself showers blessings on the Prophet, and then He informed that the angels do shower blessings upon him. Therefore, an honour which ensues from Him is much far-reaching than an honour which ensues from the angels only and which is inconceivable that Allah be with them upon its bestowal\ufffd. What Sahl has said is taken from the saying of al-Mahdi. He might have come across it, adopted some of it and explained it further. He also compared it with the honour bestowed upon Adam and showed that it is more far-reaching and complete than it. It is also mentioned in the rigorously authenticated collections of prophetic sayings the following: Abu Bakr ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Isa ibn 'Amrawayh\u003e Ibrahim ibn Sufyan\u003e Muslim\u003e Qutaybah and 'Ali ibn Hajar\u003e Isma'il ibn Ja'far\u003e al-'Ala'\u003e his father\u003e Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhoever invokes blessings on me once, Allah will invoke blessings upon him ten times\ufffd."
