  "text": "(O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites\ufffd) [33:1]. This verse was revealed about Abu Sufyan, \ufffdIkrimah ibn Abi Jahl and Abu\ufffdl-A\ufffdwar al-Sulami [\ufffdAmr ibn Sufyan]. After the fighting at Uhud, they travelled to Medina and stayed as guests at \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy\ufffds. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, had allowed them to come to speak with him with his assurance of protection. They went to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, accompanied by \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Sa\ufffdd ibn Abi Sarh and Tu\ufffdmah ibn Ubayriq. They said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who had \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab with him: \ufffdReject the mention of our idols al-Lat, al-\ufffdUzza and Manat and say that they have benefit and the power of intercession for those who worship them, and we will leave you alone with your Lord!\ufffd Their words hurt the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be well pleased with him, said: \ufffdLet me kill them, O Messenger of Allah!\ufffd The Prophet said: \ufffdI have given them my assurance of protection\ufffd, upon which \ufffdUmar said to them: \ufffdLeave with Allah\ufffds curse and wrath upon you\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded \ufffdUmar to drive them out of Medina, and then Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed this verse."
