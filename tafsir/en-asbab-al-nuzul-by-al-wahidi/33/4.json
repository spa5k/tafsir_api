  "text": "(Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body\ufffd) [33:4]. This verse was revealed about Jamil ibn Ma'mar al-Fihri who was a sensible man who memorised whatever he heard. The Quraysh said: \ufffdHe could not have memorised all these things unless he had two hearts\ufffd. Labib used to say: \ufffdI have two hearts and my perception by means of either one of them is better than the perception of Muhammad\ufffd. When the Battle of Badr took place and the idolaters were defeated, Abu Sufyan met Jamil ibn Ma'mar, who had accompanied the idolaters. Jamil was wearing one shoe and holding the other shoe in his hand. Abu Sufyan asked him: \ufffdWhat is the state of people?\ufffd He said: \ufffdThey were defeated\ufffd. Abu Sufyan asked him again: \ufffdBut why are you wearing one shoe and holding the other in your hand?\ufffd Jamil said: \ufffdI thought I was wearing both shoes\ufffd. On that day, people knew that he would not have forgotten his shoe in his hand if he really had two hearts. (hath He made those whom ye claim (to be your sons) your sons) [33:4]. This verse was revealed about Zayd ibn Harithah. He was a slave of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, but he freed him and adopted him before he was sent as a Prophet. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, married Zaynab bint Jahsh, who was the divorcee of Zayd ibn Harithah, the Jews and hypocrites said: \ufffdMuhammad has married the wife of his son while forbidding people from doing the same!\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. Sa'id ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Nu'aym al-Ishkabi informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Makhlid\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi\u003e Qutaybah ibn Sa'id\u003e Ya'qub ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\u003e Musa ibn 'Uqbah\u003e Salim\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar who used to say: \ufffdWe did not use to call Zayd ibn Harithah with any other name except Zayd ibn Muhammad until the Qur'an revealed (Proclaim their real parentage. That will be more equitable in the sight of Allah) [33:5]\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Mu'alla ibn Asad\u003e 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn al-Mukhtar\u003e Musa ibn 'Uqbah."
