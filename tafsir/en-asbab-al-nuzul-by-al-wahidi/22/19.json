Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Muzakki informed us\u003e 'Abd al-Malik ibn al-Hasan ibn Yusuf\u003e Yusuf ibn Ya'qub al-Qadi\u003e 'Umar ibn Marzuq\u003e Shu'bah\u003e Abu Hashim\u003e Abu Majlaz\u003e Qays ibn 'Ubad who reported that he heard Abu Dharr say: \ufffdI swear by Allah that this verse (These Twain (the believers and disbelievers) are two opponents who contend concerning their Lord) was revealed about the following six: Hamzah, 'Ubaydah, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, 'Utbah, Shaybah, and al-Walid ibn 'Utbah\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Hajjaj ibn Minhal from Hushaym from Abu Hashim. Abu Bakr ibn al-Harth informed us\u003e Abu'l-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Sulayman\u003e Hilal ibn Bishr\u003e Yusuf ibn Ya'qub\u003e\u003e Sulayman al-Taymi\u003e Abu Majlaz\u003e Qays ibn 'Ubad\u003e 'Ali who said: \ufffdThe words of Allah (These Twain (the believers and disbelievers) are two opponents who contend concerning their Lord) up to (Taste the doom of burning) [22:22] was revealed about us and about our duels on the Day of Badr\ufffd. Said Ibn 'Abbas: \ufffdThis refers to the people of the Book. The latter said to the believers: 'We have a better right to Allah than you; our Scripture is older than yours and our prophet came before your prophet'. The believers said: 'It is us who have a better right to Allah than you; we believe in Muhammad and in your prophet as we believe in all revealed Scriptures. You have recognized our prophet but refrained from believing in him. You disbelieved in him only because you envied him resentfully'. This was their issue of contention regarding their Lord. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse about them\ufffd. This opinion is also the view of Qatadah."
