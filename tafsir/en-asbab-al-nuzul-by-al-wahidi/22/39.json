  "text": "(Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged\ufffd) [22:39]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThe idolaters from among the people of Mecca were in the habit of harming the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. These Companions used to come always either beaten or with their skulls bashed in. They complained to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, about this situation and he persistently told them: \ufffdBe steadfast, for I have not been commanded to fight\ufffd. This continued until the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, migrated, upon which Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdWhen the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was taken out of Mecca, Abu Bakr, may Allah be well pleased with him, said about him: \ufffdWe are unto Allah, and unto Him we shall return; we shall surely perish\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged; and Allah is indeed Able to give them victory). Abu Bakr said: \ufffdI knew at that point that there will be fighting\ufffd \ufffd."
