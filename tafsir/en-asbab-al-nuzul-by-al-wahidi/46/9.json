Al-Kalbi reported from Abu Salih that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdWhen tribulations faced by the Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, intensified, The Prophet saw in his dream that he migrated to a land that had palms, trees and plenty of water. He related this dream to his Companions and the latter took it for a good omen and a harbinger of relief from the harm of the idolaters which they faced. After a while, when they saw that nothing had happened, they said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah! When are you going to migrate to the land which you saw in your dream?\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer them, but Allah, exalted is He, revealed (\ufffdnor know I what will be done with me or with you\ufffd), i.e. I do not know whether or not I am going to move to the place which I saw in my dream. I follow only that which is revealed to me\ufffd."
