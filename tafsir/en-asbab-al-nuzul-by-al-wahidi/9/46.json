  "text": "(Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee\ufffd) [9:42-47]. Allah then revealed about those hypocrites who stayed behind and did not take part in the Battle of Tabuk (Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee\ufffd). He also revealed (Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble\ufffd). This is because when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, set forth, he camped his troops at al-Wada\ufffd \ufffds mountain trail while \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy camped his troops at a clear trodden path below the mountain trail of al-Wada\ufffd. His troops were no less than the troops which were with the Prophet. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, marched again, \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy, the hypocrites and the doubters stayed behind. To consol His Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble\ufffd)."
