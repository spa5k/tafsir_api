Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Tha\ufffdlabi informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Hamid\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma\ufffdmar\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Abu Salamah ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Khudri who said: \ufffdWhile the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was dividing alms, Ibn Dhu Khuwaysirah al-Tamimi (Hurqus ibn Zuhayr, the origin of the Kharijites) came to him and said: \ufffdBe fair with us, O Messenger of Allah!\ufffd The Prophet replied to him: \ufffdWoe unto you, who is going to be fair if I am not?\ufffd And then the verse (And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms\ufffd) was revealed\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad from Hisham from Ma\ufffdmar. Al-Kalbi said: \ufffdThis was revealed about those whose hearts are to be reconciled, i.e. the hypocrites. One of them, whose name is al-Jawaz, said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: \ufffdYou did not divide [the alms] fairly!\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms)\ufffd."
