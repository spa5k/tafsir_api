Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Shirazi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Khamirawayh al-Harawi\u003e Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Muhammad al-Khuza'i\u003e Abu'l-Yaman\u003e Shu'ayb\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab\u003e his father who said: \ufffdWhen Abu Talib was about to die, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered in on him while Abu Jahl and 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah were present. He said: 'O uncle, say with me, there is no god but Allah, so that I can plead with Allah in your favour'. Abu Jahl and Ibn Abi Umayyah said: 'O Abu Talib, will you shun the religion of 'Abd al-Muttalib?' And they kept talking to him such that the last thing he uttered was: 'I follow the religion of 'Abd al-Muttalib'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, then said: 'I will pray for your forgiveness as long as I am not forbidden from doing it'. This verse was then revealed (It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of idolaters even though they may be near of kin (to them) after it hath become clear that they are people of hell-fire)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Ishaq ibn Ibrahim\u003e 'Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma'mar, and also by Muslim from Harmalah\u003e Ibn Wahb\u003e Yunus; both Ma'mar and Yunus related it from al-Zuhri. Abu Sa'id ibn Abi 'Amr al-Naysaburi informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Mu'ammil\u003e 'Amr ibn 'Abd Allah al-Basri\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab\u003e Ja'far ibn 'Awn\u003e Musa ibn 'Ubaydah\u003e Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi who said: \ufffdI heard that when Abu Talib fell ill to the illness that led to his death, the Quraysh said to him: 'O Abu Talib, send for your nephew to send you something to cure you from the Garden he mentions'. The emissary went to find the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. He found him sitting with Abu Bakr. He said to him: 'O Muhammad, your uncle says to you that he is old and weak and he wants you to send him some of the food and drink of the Garden you mention so that he regains health'. Abu Bakr replied: 'Allah, exalted is He, has made it forbidden for the unbelievers'."
