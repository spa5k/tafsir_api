Abu Ishaq al-Tha'alibi, may Allah have mercy on him, informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Hamid al-Wazzan\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far\u003e ibn 'Abd Allah al-Munadi\u003e Abu Dawud Sulayman ibn al-Ash'ath\u003e Abu Tubah al-Rabi' ibn Nafi' al-Halabi\u003e Mu'awiyah ibn Salam\u003e Zayd ibn Salam\u003e Abu Salam\u003e al-Nu'man ibn Bashir who said: \ufffdI was sitting close to the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, when a man said: 'I do not care if I ever do any other good works after I quench the thirst of the pilgrims', another man said: 'I do not care if I ever do any other work after tending to the Sacred Mosque', and a third man said: 'Jihad in the way of Allah is much better than what you have mentioned'. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab rebuked them, saying: 'Do not raise your voices so close to the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, (this happened to be a Friday). But what I will do is that, after performing my prayer, I will go in and ask the verdict of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, concerning that about which you have differed'. He did, and then Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship) up to His words (Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim from al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Halwani from Abu Tubah. Said Ibn 'Abbas, according to the report of al-Walibi: \ufffdWhen he was taken prisoner on the Day of Badr, al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib said: 'If you have precedence over us through Islam, migration and Jihad, we also used to tend to the Sacred Mosque, quench the thirst of the pilgrims and relieve the afflicted'. Allah, exalted is He, revealed therefore (Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship\ufffd)\ufffd. Al-Hasan, al-Sha'bi and al-Qurazi said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about 'Ali, al-'Abbas and Talhah ibn Shaybah who boasted to each other. Talhah said: 'I am the master of the House, its key is in my hand."
