Al-Kalbi reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdWhen Allah, exalted is He, revealed the defects of the hypocrites due to their failure to join Jihad, the believers said: \ufffdBy Allah, we will never fail to join any military conquest or expedition undertaken by the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace\ufffd. So when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, ordered the march of military expeditions to fight the enemy, all the Muslims went out to fight and left the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, alone in Medina. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse\ufffd."
