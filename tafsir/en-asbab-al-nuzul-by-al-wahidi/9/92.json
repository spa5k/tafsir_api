This verse was revealed about the weepers who were seven in number: Ma\ufffdqil ibn Yasar, Sakhr ibn Khunays, \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ka\ufffdb al-Ansari, \ufffdUtbah ibn Zayd al-Ansari, Salim ibn \ufffdUmayr, Tha\ufffdlabah ibn \ufffdAnamah and \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mughaffal. These men went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdO Prophet of Allah, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, has recommended that we go out [to fight for His sake], so carry us with you \ufffd even though we wear mended slippers and sewed sandals \ufffd so that we fight with you\ufffd. He said to them: \ufffdI do not have any mounts on which to carry you\ufffd, upon which they withdrew crying. Mujahid said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about the sons of Muqarrin: Ma\ufffdqil, Suwayd and al-Nu\ufffdman\ufffd."
