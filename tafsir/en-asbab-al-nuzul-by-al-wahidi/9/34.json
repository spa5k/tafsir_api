  "text": "(O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly) [9:34]. This was revealed about the scholars and doctors of the people of the Book. They used to accept bribes from the communality of people; these are the gains they used to obtain from the common people. (They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah\ufffd) [9:34]. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri\ufffd informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Hamid\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\u003e Muhammad ibn Nusayr\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn Zurarah\u003e Hushaym\u003e Husayn\u003e Zayd ibn Wahb who said: \ufffdI passed by al-Rabadhah where I came across Abu Dharr. I asked him: \ufffdWhat brought you here?\ufffd He said: \ufffdI was in Syria and I had a disagreement with Mu\ufffdawiyah regarding the verse (They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah\ufffd). Mu\ufffdawiyah was of the opinion that it was revealed about the people of the Book, while I said to him that it was revealed about them as well as about us. We had an altercation after which he wrote to \ufffdUthman to complain about me. \ufffdUthman wrote to me asking me to go to Medina. When I went to Medina, a lot of people came to see me, as if they had never seen me before. I mentioned this to \ufffdUthman and he said: \ufffdIf you wish you can move somewhere else and stay close\ufffd. This is what has brought me to this place. Had they appointed an Abyssinian slave as my leader, I would have heard and obeyed him\ufffd \ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Qutaybah from Jarir from Husayn; he also narrated it from \ufffdAli from Hushaym. The Commentators of the Qur\ufffdan also disagree about the occasion of this verse. Some are of the opinion that it was specifically revealed about the people of the Book. Al-Suddi thought it was revealed about the people of the Qiblah while al-Dahhak was of the opinion that it was about both the people of the Book and the Muslims. \ufffdAta\ufffd also reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said regarding the words of Allah (They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah\ufffd): \ufffdHe means of the believers\ufffd. Abu\ufffdl-Hasan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Najjar informed us\u003e Sulayman ibn Ayyub al-Tabarani\u003e Muhammad ibn Dawud ibn Sadaqah\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mu\ufffdafa\u003e Sharik\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah al-Muradi\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn Murrah\u003e Salim ibn Abi al-Ja\ufffdd\u003e Thawban who said: \ufffdWhen the verse (They who hoard up gold and silver\ufffd) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdMay gold and silver perish!\ufffd He was asked: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, which of the riches should we hoard?\ufffd He said: \ufffdA heart which is grateful, a tongue which remembers Allah and a righteous wife\ufffd \ufffd."
