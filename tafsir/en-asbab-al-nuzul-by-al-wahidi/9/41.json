But Allah, exalted is He, refused to excuse them unless they went forth to fight, despite of what had ensued from them before. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr ibn Matar\u003e Ibrahim ibn \ufffdAli\u003e Yahya ibn Yahya\u003e Sufyan ibn \ufffdUyaynah\u003e Ibn Jad\ufffdan [\ufffdAli ibn Zayd]\u003e Anas who said: \ufffdAbu Talhah recited (Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed) and then said: \ufffdI see that Allah has not excused anyone\ufffd, and he went to Syria to take part in Jihad and remained there until he died\ufffd. Said al-Suddi: \ufffdOne day, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad, who was a huge, fat man, went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to complain to him [about his size] and to dispense him from taking part in fighting. (Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed) was revealed about him. But when this verse was revealed, people found it very hard on them, and so Allah, exalted is He, abrogated it and revealed instead (Not unto the weak nor unto the sick\ufffd) [9:91]\ufffd."
