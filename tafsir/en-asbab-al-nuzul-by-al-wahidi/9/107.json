  "text": "(And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime, they will surely swear: We purposed naught save good. Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. Never stand (to pray) there\ufffd) [9:107-108]. The commentators of the Qur'an said: \ufffdThe Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf built a mosque at Quba' and sent for the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to come to them. He went there and prayed in that mosque. Their brothers from the Banu Ghunm ibn 'Awf envied them resentfully and said: 'Let us built a mosque and send for the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to pray in it as he prayed in the mosque of our brothers, and let Abu 'Amir al-Rahib (the monk) also pray in it when he comes back from Syria'. This Abu 'Amir had embraced Christianity and became a monk in the pre-Islamic period. But when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, moved to Medina, Abu 'Amir rejected the religion of Islam and showed enmity toward it. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him then Abu 'Amir al-Fasiq (the corrupt) [instead of Abu 'Amir al-Rahib (the monk)]. Abu 'Amir left to Syria and then sent a letter to the hypocrites in which he wrote: 'Prepare yourselves and make ready whatever you can of force and weapons. Built a mosque for me, for I am going to the Caesar to request him to send with me Byzantine soldiers so that I drive out Muhammad and his Companions'. And so, they built for him a mosque by the Quba' mosque. Those who built this mosque were 12 men: Khidham ibn Khalid (this mosque of opposition was an extension of his house), Tha'labah ibn Hatib, Mu'attib ibn Qushayr, Abu Habibah ibn al-Az'ar, 'Abbad ibn Hunayf, Jariyah ibn 'Amir, his two sons Majma' and Zayd, Nabtal ibn Harith, Bahzaj ibn 'Uthman, Bijad ibn 'Uthman and Wadi'ah ibn Thabit. When they finished building this mosque, they went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'We have built a mosque for the sick and the needy and also for use in rainy and wintry nights, and we would like you to come and pray in it'."
