The commentators of the Qur'an said: �This verse was revealed about Banu'l-Nadir. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, moved to Medina, they signed a treaty with him in which they agreed not fight against him or with him and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, consented. Then when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, defeated the idolaters at Badr, Banu'l-Nadir said: 'By Allah, he is the Prophet whose description we find in the Torah; he will not be defeated'. However, when the Muslims were defeated at Uhud, they broke their pledge and showed enmity toward the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Muslims. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, surrounded them and then they signed a settlement treaty in which it was agreed that they leave Medina�. Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn al-Fadl al-Tajir\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e 'Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma'mar\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Ibn Ka'b ibn Malik\u003e one of the Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who related that the unbelievers of Quraysh wrote the following to the Jews after the Battle of Badr: �You are people of armaments and fortresses. Verily, you either fight our man or we shall do this and that, such that nothing will prevent us from the bracelets on your women's anklets�. When their letter reached the Jews, the Banu'l-Nadir were unanimously in favour of treason. They sent to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, saying: �Come with thirty of your men and we will send thirty of our men. Let us meet in a location halfway between you and us so that our men hear you and if they believe in you, we will all believe in you�. However, when they reached a certain location, some Jews said: �How are you going to get to him when he has with him thirty of his Companions who all desire to die before him? Send to him and say: 'How are we going to understand [what you are going to say to us] when there are sixty of us? Come along with three of your Companions and three of our scholars will meet you."

      "text": "O you who have faith, be wary of God and let every soul consider what it has sent on ahead for tomorrow, and be wary of God. In this one verse He mentions godwariness twice. First is the godwariness of the common people, namely the avoidance of forbidden things. Second is the godwariness of the elect, namely the avoidance of everything other than the Real. It has also been said that the first alludes to the root of godwariness and the second to the perfection of godwariness. No one can pass over the steep road of the resurrection without the perfection of godwariness. One must be detached from all objects of desire, one must seize on not reaching one's desires, and one must consider all sweet drinks as poison. When someone's feet reach this point, he has reached the perfection of godwariness. WāsiṬī said, “When the folk of godwariness act proudly toward the sons of this world, they are making claims in godwariness.” For, if this world had no impact on their hearts, they would not be proud about turning away from it. A great one said, “This world is a shard of pottery seen in a dream. The next world is a pearl found in wakefulness. The man is not someone who is wary of a shard in a dream-the manly man is he who is wary of a pearl found in wakefulness.” In short, know that the steps of the travelers in the road of godwariness are three: The step of the Shariah illuminates the door of the bodily frame. The step of the Tariqah illuminates the door of the heart. The step of the Haqiqah illuminates the door of the spirit. When those who travel in the bodily frame arrive, the hospitality of Surely the godwary will be in the midst of gardens and a river [54:54] will be brought for them. When those who travel in the heart arrive, the hospitality of a seat of truthfulness [54:55] will be brought for them. When those who travel in the spirit arrive, the hospitality of at an Omnipotent King [54:55] will be brought for them."

      "text": "(Those who entered the city and the faith before them�) [59:9]. Ja�far ibn Burqan related that Yazid al-Asamm said: �The Helpers said: �O Messenger of Allah, divide the land into two equal halves between us and the Emigrants�. He said: �No, they will suffice you their livelihood. Instead you will share the fruits of the land with them while keeping the land itself to yourselves�. They said: �We accept�, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Those who entered the city and the faith before them�)�. (� but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot�) [59:9]. Sa�id ibn Ahmad ibn Ja�far al-Mu�adhdhin informed us\u003e Abu �Ali al-Faqih\u003e Muhammad ibn Mansur ibn Abi al-Jahm al-Sabi�i\u003e Nasr ibn �Ali al-Jahdami\u003e �Abd Allah ibn Dawud\u003e Fudayl ibn Ghazwan\u003e Abu Hazim\u003e Abu Hurayrah who related that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entrusted one of the folk of the Platform (al-Suffah) to a man from the Helpers. The latter took the former to his family and asked his wife: �Do we have anything [to feed him]?� She said: �We do not have anything except the children�s food�. He said: �Put them to sleep and then bring me the food. And when you put the food down, turn the lamp off�. She did as her husband requested. The Helper offered what he had to his guest. The following morning he took him back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: �Indeed, the dwellers of the heavens are amazed at what you two have done�. This verse was then revealed (� but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot�). This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Musaddid\u003e �Abd Allah ibn Dawud, and also by Muslim\u003e Abu Kurayb\u003e Waki�, and both Ibn Dawud and Waki� related it from Fudayl ibn Ghazwan.

The man said [to himself]: �My brother so-and-so is more in need of it than I�, and he sent it to him. This sheep�s head was sent from one person to another � it was handled by seven households � until it returned to the first man who was gifted it in the first place. This verse (� but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot�), up to the end, was revealed about this�."
