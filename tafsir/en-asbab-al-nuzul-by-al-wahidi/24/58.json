Said ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a boy from the Helpers, called Mudlij ibn \ufffdAmr, to \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab, May Allah be pleased with him, after noon to summon him. When he entered in, he saw \ufffdUmar in a state which the latter disliked to be seen in. And so he said to the Prophet: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, I wish that Allah, exalted is He, give us some commands and prohibitions regarding asking permission before entering\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Said Muqatil: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Asma\ufffd bint Marthid. She had a slave-boy who was quite old and he happened to enter in on her one day at a time in which she disliked him to enter in on her. She went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdOur servants and slaves enter in on us and find us in states in which we dislike them to see us\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse\ufffd."
