  "text": "(No blame is there upon the blind\ufffd) [24:61]. Said ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdWhen Allah, glorious and exalted is He, revealed (O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity\ufffd) [4:29], the Muslims felt vexed to eat with the sick, the old, the blind and the lame. They said: \ufffdFood is the best part of one\ufffds wealth, and Allah, exalted is He, has warned against squandering wealth in vanity. The blind cannot see where wholesome food is, the lame cannot compete over food and the sick cannot eat properly\ufffd. As a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr and al-Dahhak said: \ufffdThe lame and the blind used to feel vexed at eating with healthy people because the latter found them despicable and disliked eating with them. The people of Medina did not allow the blind, lame or sick person to share their food because they considered them dirty. For this reason, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Said Mujahid: \ufffdThis verse was revealed to grant dispensation for the sick and the elderly to eat from the houses which Allah, exalted is He, has named in this verse. This is because some Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to go to the houses of their fathers and mothers or the houses of some of those who were named in this verse, when they did not have food to give to them. The elderly and the sick were uncomfortable about eating that food because it was given to them by other than the rightful owners of that food. They used to say: \ufffdVerily, they take us to houses which are not theirs\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn al-Fadl al-Tajir\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn Abi Uways\u003e Malik\u003e Ibn Shihab\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn al-Musayyab who used to say about this verse: \ufffdIt was revealed about some people who used to leave the keys of their houses, upon travelling with the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, with the blind, the lame and the sick as well as with their next of kin. They also used to enjoin them to eat from their houses if they needed to, but those with whom the keys were entrusted did not eat from these houses, saying: \ufffdWe fear they will not be pleased if we do\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
