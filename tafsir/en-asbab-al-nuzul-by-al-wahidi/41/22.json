Master Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi informed us\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn Nujayd\u003e Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Sa\ufffdid\u003e Umayyah ibn Bistam\u003e Yazid ibn Zuray\ufffd\u003e Rawh\u003e al-Qasim\u003e Mansur\u003e Mujahid\u003e Abu Ma\ufffdmar\u003e Ibn Mas\ufffdud who said regarding this verse: \ufffdTwo men from Thaqif were one day sitting with their sons-in-law from Quraysh (or it was two men from the Quraysh who were sitting with their sons-in-law from Thaqif) in a house, when they said to each other: \ufffdDo you think that Allah hears our intimate talk and conversation?\ufffd Some of them said: \ufffdHe can hear only part of it\ufffd. Some said: \ufffdIf He can hear part of it, He can hear all of it!\ufffd This verse was revealed about this (Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from al-Humaydi and by Muslim from Ibn Abi \ufffdAmr; and both related it from Sufyan who related it from Mansur. Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Faqih informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn \ufffdAli al-Hiri\u003e Ahmad ibn \ufffdAli al-Muthanna\u003e Abu Khaythamah\u003e Muhammad ibn Hazim\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Yazid\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah who said: \ufffdI was hiding behind the cloth of the Ka\ufffdbah when three men came along; their bellies were fat and their understanding very limited. It was one man from Quraysh and his two sons-in-law, or it was one man from Thaqif and his two sons-in-law from Quraysh. They said something I did not understand. One of them said: \ufffdDo you reckon Allah can hear what we say now?\ufffd Another said: \ufffdHe will hear us if we raise our voices, but if we lower them, He will not hear us\ufffd. One of them said: \ufffdIf He can hear part of it, He can hear all of it\ufffd. I mentioned this to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and this verse was then revealed (Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins\ufffd) up to His words (and ye find yourselves (this day) among the lost) [41:23]\ufffd."
