He alone will manifest it at its proper time. However, I will inform you about its signs and what will happen ahead of it. There will be a lot of trials and harj ahead of the last Hour'. They asked: 'What does harj mean, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'This is an Abyssinian word which means killing, dryness of people's hearts and that one is cast among strangers, such that people hardly know each other, those who have good minds will disappear and only a group of weak people will remain who would neither know good nor forbid evil\ufffd '."
