He said: \ufffdO Ibn \ufffdUmar, why do you not eat?\ufffd I said: \ufffdI do not feel like it, O Messenger of Allah!\ufffd He said: \ufffdAs for me, I do feel like it; this is the fourth morning in which I did not taste any food. And if I wish, I can pray to my Lord to grant me the like of the kingdoms of Chosroes and the Caesar. What will you do then, O Ibn \ufffdUmar, when you live among people who store their provision for a year and when certainty is weakened?\ufffd By Allah, we did not leave [our place] until this verse was revealed (And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision! Allah provideth for it and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knower)\ufffd."
