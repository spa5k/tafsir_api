  "text": "(We have enjoined on man kindness to parents\ufffd) [29:8]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThis was revealed about Sa\ufffdd ibn Abi Waqqas. When the latter embraced Islam, his mother Hamnah said to him: \ufffdO Sa\ufffdd, I heard that you have renounced your old religion. By Allah, I will not take shelter under any roof to protect me from the sun and wind, nor will I eat or drink, until you disbelieve in Muhammad and revert to your old religion\ufffd. Sa\ufffdd was the dearest of her sons to her, but he refused to do as she wanted. For three days, his mother did not eat, drink or take shelter under the shade until it was feared that she may perish. At that point, Sa\ufffdd went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and complained to him. Allah, exalted is He, revealed as a response this verse as well as the verse in Surah Luqman [31:14] and the verse in Surah al-Ahqaf [46:15]\ufffd. Abu Sa\ufffdid informed us\u003e Abu Bakr al-Ghazi\u003e Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Hamdan\u003e Abu Ya\ufffdla\u003e Abu Khaythamah\u003e al-Hasan ibn Musa\u003e Zuhayr\u003e Simak ibn Harb\u003e Mus\ufffdab ibn Sa\ufffdd ibn Abi Waqqas\u003e his father who said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about me. Umm Sa\ufffdd [his mother] swore that she will never speak to me, eat or drink, until I disbelieve in Islam. She did this for three days until she passed out from exhaustion. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (We have enjoined on man kindness to parents\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim from Abu Khaythamah."
