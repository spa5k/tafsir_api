  "text": "(Alif. Lam. Mim. Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe, and will not be tested with affliction?) [29:1-2]. Said al-Sha\ufffdbi: \ufffdThese verses were revealed about some people in Mecca who embraced Islam. The Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, in Medina wrote to them saying that their faith and embracing of Islam will not be accepted from them until they emigrate from Mecca. For this reason, they left Mecca with the intention of joining Medina. However, the idolaters caught up with them and harmed them. These verses were, therefore, revealed about them. The Muslims of Medina then wrote back and said to them that such-and-such verses were revealed about you. Those Muslims in Mecca said: \ufffdWe will leave and fight whoever follows us\ufffd. They left Mecca and were pursued by the idolaters. Fighting ensued between them; some were killed and some escaped safe. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed about them (Then lo! Thy Lord\ufffdfor those who become fugitive after they had been persecuted\ufffd) [16:110]\ufffd. Said Muqatil: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Mihja\ufffd, the client of \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab, who was the first Muslim to be killed at the Battle of Badr. \ufffdAmr ibn al-Hadrami struck him with a bow which killed him. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said on that day: \ufffdThe master of all martyrs is Mihja\ufffd. He will be the first one of this community to be called to the gate of heaven\ufffd. His wife and parents were distraught because of his death, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about them these verses, explaining that they had to suffer trials and hardship for the sake of Allah, exalted is He\ufffd."
