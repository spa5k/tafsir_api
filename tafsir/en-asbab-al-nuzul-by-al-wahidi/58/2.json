  "text": "(Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers)\ufffd) [58:2]. Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mansuri informed us\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Umar al-Hafiz\u003e Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Naysaburi\u003e Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath\u003e Muhammad ibn Bakkar\u003e Sa'id ibn Bashir that he asked Qatadah about putting away one's wife declaring her to be as one's mother, and he informed him that Anas ibn Malik said: \ufffdAws ibn al-Samit put away his wife, Khuwaylah bint Tha'labah, declaring her as his mother and the latter went to complain to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. She said: 'He put me away, declaring me to be as his mother, when I grew old and my strength failed'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed the verse of putting one's wife away, declaring her to be as one's mother. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to Aws: 'You have to free one slave'. He said: 'I cannot afford it!' The Prophet said: 'Then you have to fast two consecutive months'. Aws said: 'If I fail to eat twice a day, my sight suffers'. The Prophet said: 'Then you have to feed sixty needy people'. Aws said: 'I cannot do it unless you help me'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, helped him with fifteen measures (sa') [of dates] and Allah enabled him to gather what was necessary to feed sixty needy people, and Allah is merciful - they were of the opinion that Aws already had with him fifteen measures, in order to feed sixty needy people\ufffd. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hamid al-'Adl informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Daghuli\u003e Abu'l-Hasan Ahmad ibn Siyar\u003e 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Yahya ibn Yusuf\u003e Abu'l-Asbagh al-Harrani\u003e Muhammad ibn Maslamah\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e Ma'mar ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Hanzalah\u003e Yusuf ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Salam who said: \ufffdKhuwaylah bint Tha'labah, the wife of Aws ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, related to me, saying: 'He [Aws] came in one day and said something to me in an irritated tone. I answered him back and he got angry. He said: 'You are to me as my mother'. He then went out to the gathering place of his people."
