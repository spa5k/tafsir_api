  "text": "(Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is wroth?\ufffd and they will fancy that they have some standing. Lo! is it not they who are the liars?) [58:14-18]. Al-Suddi and Muqatil said: \ufffdThis was revealed about \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Nabtal, the hypocrite who used to keep the company of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and then report what he heard from him to the Jews. As the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting one day in one of his rooms he said: \ufffdNow shall enter on you a man who has the heart of a tyrant and who looks through the eyes of the devil\ufffd. At that point \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Nabtal who was blue of complexion came in. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: \ufffdWhy do you, and your friends, insult me?\ufffd He swore by Allah that he did not, but the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said that he did. The man went and brought his friends who then swore by Allah that they did not insult him. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed these verses\ufffd. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar ibn Matar\u003e Ja\ufffdfar ibn Muhammad al-Firyabi\u003e Abu Ja\ufffdfar al-Nufayli\u003e Zuhayr ibn Mu\ufffdawiyah\u003e Simak ibn Harb\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who related to him that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting under the shade of one of his rooms with a group of Muslims from whom the shade was slowly receding. He said to them: \ufffdA man will come to you and look at you with the eyes of the devil. When he comes do not speak with him!\ufffd A man of blue complexion then came. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him and addressed him: \ufffdWhy do you and so-and-so and so-and-so (he named a group of people) insult me?\ufffd The man left and brought all those named and they swore by Allah and apologized. Allah, exalted is He, revealed (On the day when Allah will raise them all together, then will they swear unto Him as they (now) swear unto you, and they will fancy that they have some standing. Lo! is it not they who are the liars?). This was narrated by al-Hakim in his Sahih\u003e al-Asamm\u003e Ibn \ufffdAffan\u003e \ufffdAmr al-\ufffdAnqari\u003e Isra\ufffdil\u003e Simak."
