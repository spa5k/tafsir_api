Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja'far informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Makhladi\u003e al-Mu'ammil ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Isa\u003e al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sabbah\u003e Hajjaj\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e Ibn al-Munkadir\u003e Jabir who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Abu Bakr came on foot to visit me at Banu Salamah when I was sick. He found me unconscious. He asked for some water, performed minor ritual ablution and then sprinkled some of the water on me and I woke up. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! What shall I do with my wealth?' And so the verse (Allah chargeth you concerning (the provision for) your children: to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Ibrahim ibn Musa\u003e Hisham, and also by Muslim\u003e Muhammad ibn Hatim\u003e Hajjaj; and both Hisham and Hajjaj related this tradition from Ibn Jurayj. Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mansuri informed us\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Umar ibn Mahdi\u003e Yahya ibn Sa'id\u003e\u003e Ahmad ibn al-Miqdam\u003e Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Aqil\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who said: \ufffdA woman came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, with her two daughters and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! These are the daughters of Thabit ibn Qays, or perhaps she said Sa'd ibn al-Rabi', who was killed fighting on your side at the Battle of Uhud. Their uncle has taken possession of their fortune and inheritance and did not leave anything belonging to them except that he took it to himself, so what do you think, O Messenger of Allah? For by Allah, they will never get married unless they have some money'. The Messenger of Allah said to her: 'Allah will judge for you concerning this'. And so Surah al-Nisa' was revealed which contains (Allah chargeth you concerning (the provision for) your children: to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females\ufffd). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then said to me: 'Summon for me the woman and her adversary'. He said to the uncle of the girls: 'Give the girls two third of the fortune, their mother one eighth and keep the remainder' \ufffd."
