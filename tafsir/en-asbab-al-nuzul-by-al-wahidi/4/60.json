  "text": "(Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go for judgment (in their disputes) to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them?) [4:60]. Sa'id ibn Muhammad al-'Adl informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr ibn Hamdan\u003e al-Hasan ibn Sufyan\u003e Ibrahim ibn Sa'd al-Jawhari\u003e Abu'l-Yaman\u003e Safwan ibn 'Amr\u003e\u003e 'Ikrimah\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdAbu Burdah al-Aslami was a soothsayer who used to settle the disputes that the Jews had amongst themselves. When a group of people from Aslam took their dispute to him, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Hast thou not seen those who pretend\ufffd) up to his saying (\ufffd were seeking naught but harmony and kindness) [4:62]\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\u003e Abu Salih Shu'ayb ibn Muhammad\u003e Abu Hatim al-Tamimi\u003e Abu'l-Azhar\u003e Ruwaym\u003e Sa'id ibn Qatadah who said: \ufffdWe were told that this verse was revealed about a dispute regarding a certain property in which were involved a man from the Helpers called Qays and a Jewish man. They took their dispute to a soothsayer in Medina to judge between them while leaving the Prophet of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. Allah, exalted is He, rebuked them for doing so. In fact the Jew was urging the Muslim to take their dispute to the Prophet of Allah, because he knew he will not wrong him. But the Helper refused to, even though he was a Muslim, and insisted to go to the soothsayer. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse censoring the person who was pretending to be Muslim as well as the Jew who belonged to the people of the Book, saying (Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee\ufffd) up to His words (\ufffd thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion) [4:61]\ufffd. Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Marwazi informed us in writing\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Husayn\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Ishaq al-Hanzali\u003e al-Mu'ammil\u003e Yazid ibn Zuray'\u003e Dawud\u003e al-Sha'bi who said: \ufffdOne certain hypocrite had a dispute with a Jewish man. The Jew invited the hypocrite to take their dispute to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, because he knew that he did not accept bribery. The hypocrite, on the other hand, called the Jewish man to take their dispute to their own arbiters because he knew that they took bribery for the judgments they issued."
