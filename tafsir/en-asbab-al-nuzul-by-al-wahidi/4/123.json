Abu Bakr al-Tamimi informed us\u003e Abu Muhammad ibn Hayyan\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e Sahl\u003e \ufffdAli ibn Mushir\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn Abi Khalid\u003e Abu Salih who said: \ufffdThe people of the Book, the adherents of the Torah and the adherents of the Gospel, as well as the adherents of other religions sat together one day and each claimed that they were better than the others. This verse was revealed regarding this\ufffd. Said Masruq and Qatadah: \ufffdOne day, the Muslims and the people of the Book argued with each other. The people of the Book said: \ufffdWe are more guided than you; our Prophet came before yours and our Scripture was revealed before your Scripture. Moreover, we have a better right to Allah than you\ufffd. The Muslims said: \ufffdWe are more guided than you and have a better right to Allah than you. Our Prophet is the seal of prophets and our Scripture makes all the Scriptures before it outmoded\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. Allah, exalted is He, later backed the argument of the Muslims against their opponents from amongst the adherents of other religions with His words (And whoso doeth good works, whether of male or female\ufffd) [4:124] and His words (Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah\ufffd) [4:125]\ufffd."
