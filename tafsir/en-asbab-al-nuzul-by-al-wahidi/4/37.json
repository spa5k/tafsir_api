Most Qur\ufffdanic exegetes said: \ufffdThis was revealed about the Jews when they concealed the description of Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, and did not reveal it to people despite the fact that they had it written in their Scriptures\ufffd. And al-Kalbi said: \ufffdThis refers to the Jews; they failed to be truthful to those who came to them with regard to the description of Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, despite the fact that they had it written down in their Scriptures\ufffd. Said Mujahid: \ufffdThe three verses up to His saying (\ufffdwhen Allah is ever Aware of them) [4:39] were revealed about the Jews\ufffd. And Ibn \ufffdAbbas and Ibn Zayd said: \ufffdThis was revealed about a group of Jews who used to go to some men from the Helpers, mixing with them and giving them advice. They used to say to them: \ufffdDo not spend your wealth for we fear poverty for you\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others)\ufffd."
