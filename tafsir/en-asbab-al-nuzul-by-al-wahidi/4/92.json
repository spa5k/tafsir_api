Abu \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Abi Ishaq informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr ibn Nujayd\u003e Abu Muslim Ibrahim ibn \ufffdAbd Allah\u003e Ibn Hajjaj\u003e Hammad\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn al-Qasim\u003e his father who reported that al-Harith ibn Shadid was hard on the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. He was on his way to embrace Islam when he was met by \ufffdAyyash ibn Abi Rabi\ufffdah, and not realising that al-Harith wanted to embrace Islam, he killed him. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse (It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless (it be) by mistake\ufffd). Al-Kalbi explained this event, saying: \ufffd\ufffdAyyash ibn Abi Rabi\ufffdah al-Makhzumi had embraced Islam but was fearful of coming in the open about it. He fled to Medina and took refuge in one of its fortresses. His mother was distressed a great deal. She said to her two sons Abu Jahl and al-Harith ibn Hisham, who were his half brothers from his mother\ufffds side: \ufffdBy Allah, I will stay outside in the sun, not eating or drinking, until you bring him back to me\ufffd. And they went looking for him, accompanied by al-Harith ibn Zayd ibn Abi Anisah, until they reached Medina. They went to \ufffdAyyash in his fortress, and said to him: \ufffdCome down, your mother has not entered the confines of a house since you left. She has also sworn that she will not eat or drink until you go back to her. By Allah we give you assurance that we will not coerce you to do anything nor will we come between you and your religion\ufffd. When they mentioned his mother\ufffds distress and gave him their assurance, he came down to them. They took him out of Medina, tied him up with strings and whipped him a hundred lashes each, and then took him to his mother. His mother said to him: \ufffdI will not untie your fetters until you disbelieve in that which you have believed\ufffd, and he was left fettered in the sun until he gave them some of what they had wanted. Al-Harith ibn Yazid went to him and said: \ufffdO \ufffdAyyash, by Allah, if that which you followed was guidance, you have now left it, and if it was error, you were already in error\ufffd."
