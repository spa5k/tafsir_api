Said al-Kalbi: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about some Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, among whom were \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn \ufffdAwf, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad, Qudamah ibn Maz\ufffdun and Sa\ufffdd ibn Abi Waqqas. These Companions were subjected to a lot of harm from the idolaters. They used to say: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, allow us to fight them\ufffd, but his answer was always: \ufffdKeep your hands off them, for I have not been commanded to fight them\ufffd. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, migrated to Medina and Allah, exalted is He, commanded them to fight the idolaters, some of them disliked fighting and found it very hard. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-\ufffdAdl informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr Hamdan\u003e al-Hasan ibn Sufyan\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAli\u003e his father\u003e al-Husayn ibn Waqid\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn Dinar\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who related that \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn \ufffdAwf and some of his fellow companions went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, in Mecca and said: \ufffdO Prophet of Allah, we were mighty when we were idolaters but now that we are believers we became humiliated\ufffd. He said to them: \ufffdI am commanded to pardon, do not fight these people\ufffd. But when Allah, exalted is He, made him move to Medina, He commanded him to fight, they withheld their hands, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands\ufffd)."
