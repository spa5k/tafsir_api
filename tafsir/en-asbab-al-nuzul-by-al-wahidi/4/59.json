Abu \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Abu Hamid al-\ufffdAdl informed us\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Abi Zakariyya al-Hafiz\u003e Abu Hamid ibn al-Sharqi\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Hajjaj ibn Muhammad\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e Ya\ufffdla ibn Muslim\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas that he said regarding the saying of Allah, exalted is He, (O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority): \ufffdIt was revealed about Hudhafah ibn Qays ibn \ufffdAdiyy who was sent by the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, in a military expedition\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Sadaqah ibn al-Fadl and also by Muslim from Zuhayr ibn Harb and both transmitter related it from Hajjaj. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas, according to the narration of Badhan: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent Khalid ibn al-Walid in a military expedition to one of the Arab clans. He was accompanied in this expedition by \ufffdAmmar ibn Yasir. When he drew closer to them at night, he stopped to camp in order to try to conquer them the following morning. Meanwhile this clan was warned about the approaching military expedition which made them flee the area, except for one man who was a Muslim. This man asked his family to get ready to move and then he went to the camp of Khalid and entered in on \ufffdAmmar. He said to him: \ufffdO Abu\ufffdl-Yaqzan! I am one of you. But my people ran away when they heard you were coming. I stayed because I am Muslim. Is this of any benefit to me, or shall I flee as my people did?\ufffd \ufffdAmmar said: \ufffdStay, for it is beneficial to you\ufffd. The man returned to his family and told them to stay. The following morning, Khalid invaded the clan but found no one except this man, and so he imprisoned him and seized his property. \ufffdAmmar went to him and said: \ufffdLet the man go, for he is a Muslim and I have already given him amnesty and told him to stay\ufffd. Khalid said: \ufffdYou give protection from me to others while I am the leader!\ufffd Ammar said: \ufffdYes, I give protection from you to others while you are the leader\ufffd."
