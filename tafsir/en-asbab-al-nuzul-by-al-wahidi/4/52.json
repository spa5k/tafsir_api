Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Muqri' informed us\u003e Sufyan ibn Muhammad\u003e Makki ibn 'Abdan\u003e Abu'l-Azhar\u003e Rawh\u003e Sa'id\u003e\u003e Qatadah who said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf and Huyayy ibn Akhtab, two Jews from Banu'l-Nadir, who met the people of Quraysh in the season of pilgrimage and were asked by the idolaters: 'Who is more guided to the way of the truth us or Muhammad? For we are the custodians of the Sacred Precinct, we provide water for the pilgrims and we are the inhabitants of the Sacred Precinct'. They said: 'No indeed, you are more guided than Muhammad'. They said this while knowing very well they were lying. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and he whom Allah hath cursed, thou (O Muhammad) wilt find for him no helper). When they went back to their people, the latter told them: 'Muhammad claims that such-and-such was revealed about you'. They said: 'He has said the truth. By Allah, the hatred and resentful envy that we have for him drove us to do so' \ufffd."
