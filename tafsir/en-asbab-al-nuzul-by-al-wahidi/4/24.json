Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Bunani informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Hamdan\u003e Abu Ya\ufffdla\u003e \ufffdAmr al-Naqid\u003e Abu Ahmad al-Zubayri\u003e Sufyan\u003e \ufffdUthman al-Batti\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Khalil\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Khudri who said: \ufffdWe had captured female prisoners of war on the day of Awtas and because they were already married we disliked having any physical relationship with them. Then we asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, about them. And the verse (And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess) was then revealed, as a result of which we consider it lawful to have a physical relationship with them\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Harith informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e Sahl ibn \ufffdUthman\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahim\u003e Ash\ufffdath ibn Sawwar\u003e \ufffdUthman al-Batti\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Khalil\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid who said: \ufffdWhen the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, captured the people of Awtas as prisoners of war we said: \ufffdO Prophet of Allah! How can we possibly have physical relationships with women whose lineage and husband we know very well?\ufffd And so this verse was revealed (And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess)\ufffd. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdIsa ibn \ufffdAmrawayh\u003e Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Sufyan\u003e Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj\u003e \ufffdUbayd Allah ibn \ufffdUmar al-Qawariri\u003e Yazid ibn Zuray\ufffd\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Abi \ufffdArubah\u003e Qatadah\u003e Abu Salih Abu Khalil\u003e Abu \ufffdAlqamah al-Hashimi\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Khudri who reported that on the day of Hunayn the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent an army to Awtas. This army met the enemy in a battle, defeated them and captured many female prisoners from them. But some of the Companions of the Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, were uncomfortable about having physical relations with these prisoners because they had husbands who were idolaters, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about this (And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess)."
