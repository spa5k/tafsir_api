The teacher Abu \ufffdUthman al-Za\ufffdfarani al-Muqri\ufffd informed us in the year [4]25\u003e Abu Muhammad \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAli ibn Ziyad al-Suddi in the year 363\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Fadl ibn Muhammad al-Jazari in the Sacred Mosque, Mecca, in 304\u003e \ufffdAli ibn Ziyad al-Lahji\u003e Abu Qurrah Musa ibn Tariq\u003e Sufyan\u003e Mansur\u003e Mujahid\u003e Abu \ufffdAyyash al-Zurraqi who said: \ufffdWe performed the prayer of Zuhr with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, upon which the idolaters exclaimed: \ufffdThey were in a vulnerable situation, why did we not attack them by surprise?\ufffd Then they said: \ufffdThere shall come another prayer which is more beloved to them than their own fathers, which is the midafternoon (\ufffdAsr) prayer\ufffd. Gabriel, peace be upon him, then came down with these verses between the Zuhr and the \ufffdAsr prayers. (And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them and arrangest (their) worship for them) in \ufffdUsfan, while the idolaters were led by Khalid ibn al-Walid; they were between us and the qiblah, and then He mentioned the prayer of fear\ufffd. \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn \ufffdAbdan informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Dabbi\u003e Muhammad ibn Ya\ufffdqub\u003e Ahmad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Jabbar\u003e Yunus ibn Bukayr\u003e al-Nadr Abu \ufffdUmar\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went out and met the idolaters in \ufffdUsfan. When he performed the Zuhr prayer, and the idolaters saw him bowing and prostrating, they said to each other: \ufffdThis was a missed opportunity for you. If you had raided them then, they would not have felt you coming until you had effectively attacked them\ufffd. One of them said: \ufffdThey have another prayer which is more beloved to them than their wives and wealth, so get ready to raid them when they are performing it\ufffd. Allah, glorious and majestic is He, then revealed to His Prophet, (And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them and arrangest (their) worship for them) up to the end of the verse, and informed him about the plot of the idolaters and mentioned therein the prayer of fear\ufffd."
