Abu \ufffdUthman Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad al-\ufffdAdl informed us\u003e his grandfather\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Sarraj\u003e Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Razi\u003e Salamah ibn al-Fadl\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Sahl ibn Sa\ufffdd\u003e Marwan ibn al-Hakam\u003e Zayd ibn Thabit who said: \ufffdI was with the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, when the verse (Those of the believers who sit still are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah) and did not mention (other than those who have a (disabling) hurt). Ibn Umm Maktum said: \ufffdHow is this so when I am blind and unable to see?\ufffd The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was overwhelmed with revelation in this assembly and he leaned on my thigh. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, his weight grew so much on my thigh that I feared he would crush it. Then he was relieved, upon which he said: \ufffdWrite: (Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a (disabling) hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah)\ufffd, and I wrote it down\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn \ufffdAbd Allah\u003e Ibrahim ibn Sa\ufffdd\u003e Salih\u003e al-Zuhri. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar ibn Matar\u003e Abu Khalifah\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Walid\u003e Shu\ufffdbah\u003e Abu Ishaq\u003e al-Bara\ufffd who said: \ufffdWhen the verse (Those of the believers who sit still are not on an equality\ufffd), the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called Zayd who went to him with a shoulder blade and wrote on it this verse. But Ibn Umm Maktum complained about the fact that he is blind, and so the verse (Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a (disabling) hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah) was revealed\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Abu\ufffdl-Walid and by Muslim from Bundar from Ghundar, and both Abu\ufffdl-Walid and Ghundar related it from Shu\ufffdbah. Isma'il ibn Abi al-Qasim al-Nasrabadhi informed us\u003e Isma'il ibn Najid\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abdus\u003e 'Ali ibn al-Ja'd\u003e Zuhayr\u003e Abu Ishaq\u003e al-Bara' that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdCall Zayd for me and ask him to bring with him a shoulder blade and an inkwell\ufffd, or he said: \ufffda slate\ufffd."
