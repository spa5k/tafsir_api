Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr Isma'il ibn Najid\u003e Yusuf ibn Ya'qub al-Qadi\u003e 'Amr ibn Marzuq\u003e Shu'bah\u003e 'Adiyy ibn Thabit\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Yazid ibn Thabit who reported that a group of people initially accompanied the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to Uhud but then turned back and returned to Medina. The Muslims were divided in their opinions about them. Some of them were of the opinion that they should be killed while others thought they should be spared, and so this verse was revealed. This was revealed by Bukhari\u003e Bundar\u003e Ghundar and also by Muslim\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Mu'adh\u003e his father; and both transmitters (Ghundar and Ibn Mu'adh's father) related it from Shu'bah. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Hamdan al-'Adl informed us\u003e Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ja'far ibn Malik\u003e 'Ubayd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e his father\u003e al-Aswad ibn 'Amir\u003e Hammad ibn Salamah\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e Yazid ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Qusayt\u003e Abu Salamah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\u003e his father who related that a group of Arabs came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and embraced Islam. Then they contracted the illness and fever that was going round in Medina and, as a result, renounced Islam and left Medina. They were met by a group among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace who asked them: \ufffdWhy did you leave Medina?\ufffd They replied: \ufffdWe contracted the illness of Medina and for this reason we disliked remaining there\ufffd. The Companions said: \ufffdDo you not have a good example in the person of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace?\ufffd Some of the Companions were of the opinion that these Arabs were hypocrites while others thought they were still Muslims. And because of this difference of opinion, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites\ufffd). Mujahid said apropos this verse: \ufffdThis was revealed about some people who left Mecca to Medina, claiming to be Emigrants. They then renounced Islam and asked permission from the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to go to Mecca to bring some merchandise with which to trade."
