Do ye blame us for aught else than that we believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed aforetime, and because most of you are evil-livers?) [5:59]. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdA group of Jews went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and asked him about the messengers he believed in. He replied: \ufffdI believe (\ufffd in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the Prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered) [2:136]\ufffd. But when he mentioned Jesus, they rejected his prophethood and said: \ufffdBy Allah, we know of no adherents of any religion who are less lucky in this world and the next than you; nor do we know of any other religion which is more evil than yours. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Say: O People of the Scripture! Do ye blame us for aught else than that we believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us) up to His words (and because most of you are evil-livers?)\ufffd \ufffd."
