Their wine was made from unripe dates, split unripe dates and dates. We heard a crier announcing that intoxicants were made unlawful. And so wine started flowing in the streets of Medina. Abu Talhah said: \ufffdGo out and spill it\ufffd, and so I spilled it. But then one of the people said: \ufffdSo-and-so and so-and-so were killed with wine in their bellies\ufffd. As a result, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who believe and do good works for what they may have eaten (in the past))\ufffd.
