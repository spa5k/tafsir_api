Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar al-Mu\ufffdadhdhin informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli al-Faqih\u003e Abu Lubabah Muhammad ibn al-Mahdi al-Mihani\u003e \ufffdAmmar ibn al-Hasan\u003e Salamah ibn al-Fadl\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn \ufffdUbayd\u003e al-Hasan al-Basri\u003e Jabir ibn \ufffdAbd Allah al-Ansari who related that a man from Muharib by the name of Ghawrath ibn al-Harith said to his people of Banu Ghatafan and Muharib: \ufffdShall I kill Muhammad for you?\ufffd \ufffdYes, but how are you going to do it?\ufffd they asked him. He said: \ufffdI will assassinate him!\ufffd This man then proceeded to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and found him sitting with his sword in his lap. He said: \ufffdO Muhammad, let me see this sword of yours\ufffd. He handed the sword over to him. The man took the sword out of its scabbard, moved it about but whenever he was on the point of striking the Prophet with it, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, restrained him. The man then said: \ufffdO Muhammad, are you not scared of me?\ufffd \ufffdNo!\ufffd answered the Prophet. The man said: \ufffdYou are not scared of me even though the sword is in my hand?\ufffd The Prophet said: \ufffdAllah will protect me from you\ufffd. The man put the sword back in its scabbard and gave it back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, upon which Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Remember Allah\ufffds favour unto you, how a people were minded to stretch out their hands against you\ufffd). Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Tha\ufffdlabi informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Hamid\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma\ufffdmar\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Abu Salamah\u003e Jabir who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, stopped by at a certain location and so people spread about to seek shade under the trees. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, hang his weapon on a tree and sat down to rest. A Bedouin came along, got hold of the sword belonging to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, turned to him and said: \ufffdWho will save you from me now?\ufffd The Prophet said: \ufffdAllah!\ufffd The Bedouin repeated the same question two or three times, and the answer of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was always the same: \ufffdAllah!\ufffd The Bedouin then put the sword back in its scabbard."
