  "text": "O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord\ufffd) [5:67]. Said al-Hasan: \ufffdThe Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhen Allah, exalted is He, sent me as His message, I felt oppressed by it, for I knew that some people will give me the lie\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was apprehensive of the Quraysh, Jews and Christians, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Sa\ufffdid Muhammad ibn \ufffdAli al-Saffar informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Makhladi\u003e Muhammad ibn Hamdun ibn Khalid\u003e Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Halwani\u003e al-Hasan ibn Hammad Sijjadah\u003e \ufffdAli ibn \ufffdAbis\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Hajjab\u003e \ufffdAtiyyah\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Khudri who said: \ufffdThis verse (O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord\ufffd) was revealed on the day of \ufffdGhadir Khumm\ufffd about \ufffdAli ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him\ufffd. (Allah will protect thee from mankind) [5:67]. Said \ufffdA\ufffdishah, may Allah be well pleased with her: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, stayed up one night and so I said: \ufffdWhat\ufffds the matter, O Messenger of Allah?\ufffd He said: \ufffdIs there not any righteous man who would stand to watch over us tonight?\ufffd Then we heard commotion caused by arms and the Messenger of Allah asked: \ufffdWho\ufffds there?\ufffd \ufffdIt is Sa\ufffdd and Hudhayfah, we have come to keep watch over you\ufffd, came the response. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went to sleep, and he slept so deep that I heard his snoring; this verse was then revealed. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then popped his head out of the collar of his garment and said: \ufffdO people, you can leave, for Allah has protected me\ufffd \ufffd. Isma\ufffdil ibn Ibrahim al-Wa\ufffdiz informed us\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn Nujayd\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Khalil\u003e Muhammad ibn al-\ufffdAla\ufffd\u003e al-Himmani\u003e al-Nadr\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to be guarded. Abu Talib used to send every day men from the Banu Hashim to guard him until this verse was revealed (O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord) up to His words (Allah will protect thee from mankind). And so when his uncle wanted to send with him people to protect him, he said: \ufffdO uncle! Indeed Allah has protected me from the jinn and humans\ufffd \ufffd."
