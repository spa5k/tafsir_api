Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e Sahl ibn \ufffdUthman\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Za\ufffdidah\u003e Musa ibn \ufffdUbayda\u003e Aban ibn Salih\u003e al-Qa\ufffdqa\ufffd ibn Hakim\u003e Salma Umm Rafi\ufffd\u003e Abu Rafi\ufffd who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded me to kill dogs. But people said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, what is made lawful for us from this community [of dogs] which we are commanded to kill?\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (They ask thee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey)\ufffd. This was narrated by al-Hakim Abu \ufffdAbd Allah in his Sahih\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Balawayh\u003e Muhammad ibn Shadhan\u003e Mu\ufffdalla ibn Mansur\u003e Ibn Abi Za\ufffdidah. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said in explanation of this story: \ufffdSaid Abu Rafi\ufffd: \ufffdGabriel, peace be upon him, went to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, but did not enter in on the Prophet even though he was granted permission to enter. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, came out and said to him: \ufffdWe have given you permission to enter, O Gabriel!\ufffd He said: \ufffdYes, you have, O Messenger of Allah, except that we do not enter a house where there is a picture or a dog\ufffd. They looked around and found that there was a puppy in one of the rooms\ufffd. Abu Rafi\ufffd said: \ufffdThe Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded me to kill every dog in Medina. I proceeded with the execution of the command until I reached al-\ufffdAwali where I found a woman who kept a dog for her protection. Out of compassion for her, I did not kill her dog. I went back to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and informed him of what had happened, and he commanded me to go back and kill it. I went back and killed it. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded the killing of dogs, a group of people went to him and said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, What is lawful for us of this community that we have been commanded to kill?\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer, and then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse."
