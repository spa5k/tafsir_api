Abu Sa'id ibn Abi Bakr al-Razi informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr ibn Hamdan\u003e Abu Ya'la\u003e al-Harith ibn Shurayh\u003e Yahya ibn Zakariyya ibn Abi Za'idah\u003e Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Qasim\u003e 'Abd al-Malik ibn Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e his father\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdTamim al-Dari and 'Adiyy ibn Badda' used to come to Mecca. On one occasion, a man from Quraysh, from Banu Sahm, travelled with the two of them. However, this man died in a land where there was not a single Muslim and he had to entrust them with his belongings, with the understanding that they were to be given to his family. When the two of them arrived, they gave his belongings to his family but kept to themselves a silver bowl adorned with layers of gold. They denied having seen this bowl when they were asked about it. The two men were taken to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who asked them to swear that they neither saw the bowl nor did they keep it. When they swore, he let them go. Later this bowl was found with some of the people of Mecca who said that they had bought it from Tamim al-Dari and 'Adiyy ibn Badda'. The heirs of the man from Banu Sahm took the bowl and two men from among them swore that the bowl belonged to their man, that their testimony is truer than the testimony of the other two men and that they did not transgress. These two verses were revealed about this event (O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you) up to the end\ufffd."
