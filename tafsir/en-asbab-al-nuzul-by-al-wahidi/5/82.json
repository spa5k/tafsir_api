These verses were revealed about the Negus and his followers. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdWhen he was in Mecca, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to fear the idolaters\ufffd persecution of his Companions. He therefore sent Ja\ufffdfar ibn Abi Talib and \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mas\ufffdud, at the head of a group of his Companions, to the Negus. He said: \ufffdThe Negus is a righteous man; he is not an oppressor and none is oppressed in his dominion. So head toward him and remain there until Allah creates relief for the Muslims\ufffd. When they went to him, the Negus honoured them and then asked them: \ufffdDo you memorise anything of that which was revealed to you?\ufffd They answered in the affirmative and then recited to him [some Qur\ufffdan,] with monks and priests surrounding him. Whenever they read a verse, the tears rolled down their cheeks due to the truth which they recognized. Allah, exalted is He, says: (That is because there are among them priests and monks, and because they are not proud)\ufffd. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Hamdun ibn al-Fadl\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Abu Salih, the scribe of al-Layth\u003e al-Layth\u003e Yunus\u003e Ibn Shihab\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn al-Musayyab and \ufffdUrwah ibn al-Zubayr as well as others who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent \ufffdAmr ibn Umayyah al-Damri with a message to the Negus. The latter read the message of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and then called Ja\ufffdfar ibn Abi Talib and all the Emigrants with him and he also invited priests and monks to the assembly. He ordered Ja\ufffdfar ibn Abi Talib to recite to them from the Qur\ufffdan, and he read Surah Maryam, peace be upon her. They believed in the Qur\ufffdan and tears flowed from their eyes. It is about them that Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians) up to His words (Inscribe us as among the witnesses)\ufffd."
