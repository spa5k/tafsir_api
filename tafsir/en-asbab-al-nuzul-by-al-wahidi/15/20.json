The livelihood of the desirers is the auspicious- ness of turning toward Him, the livelihood of the recognizers is the gentleness of His beauty, and the livelihood of the tawḤīd-voicers is the unveiling of His majesty. Each is connected to his own state, and each has a portion of His bounteousness. But the Real is incomparable with beautifying Himself through His acts."
