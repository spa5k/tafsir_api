Ibn al-Mubarak reported through his chain of transmission from a Companion of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, that he said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, came out to us from the door which the Banu Shaybah use and found us laughing. He said: 'I see that you are laughing!' He retreated but when he reached the buttress, he came back to us and said: 'When I left, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to me and said: 'O Muhammad, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, says: Why are you driving my servants to despair? (Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful)' ' \ufffd."
