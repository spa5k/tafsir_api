  "text": "(Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not. And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go, he bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path (of conduct)?) [16:75-76]. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e Abu Bakr ibn al-Anbari\u003e Ja\ufffdfar ibn Muhammad ibn Shakir\u003e \ufffdAffan\u003e Wuhayb\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn \ufffdUthman ibn Khuthaym\u003e Ibrahim\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdThis verse (Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave\ufffd) about Hisham ibn \ufffdAmr who used to spend his wealth openly and in secret and his client Abu\ufffdl-Jawza\ufffd who used to bid him to stop doing so. As for the verse (And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing), the dumb who has control of nothing is Usayd ibn Abi al-\ufffdIs and the one who (enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path\ufffd) is \ufffdUthman ibn \ufffdAffan\ufffd."
