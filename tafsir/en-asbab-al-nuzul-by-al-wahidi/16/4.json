This verse was revealed about Ubayy ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi when he brought decaying bones to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and then said: \ufffdO Muhammad, do you think Allah will bring this to life after its decay?\ufffd. Something similar to this verse is Allah\ufffds words in Surah Yasin (Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed? Yet lo! He is an open opponent\ufffd) [36:77] up to the end of the Surah. This verse was revealed on the occasion of this incident."
