Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mansuri informed us\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Umar al-Hafiz\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz\u003e al-Hakam ibn Musa\u003e Isma'il ibn 'Ayyash\u003e 'Abd al-Malik ibn Abi Ghaniyyah\u003e al-Hakam ibn 'Utaybah\u003e Mujahid\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdWhen the idolaters retreated from those who were killed at the Battle of Uhud, The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went there and saw a scene which he strongly disliked. And he also saw Hamzah with his stomach ripped open, nose burnt and ears cut off. He said: 'If it were not for the fear of causing more grief to the women or that it becomes a followed practice after me, I would leave him until Allah, exalted is He, resurrect him from the bellies of predatory animals and birds. I shall kill seventy men of them [of the disbelievers of Quraysh] in revenge', He then asked for a mantle to cover him with it. When he covered his face, his feet remained uncovered and so he covered them with some Bulrush. He then placed him forward and said 'Allah is the greatest' ten times. Then, all those Muslim dead were brought, one by one, while the body of Hamzah was unmoved from its place, and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, prayed on them. And so He performed seventy prayers on Hamzah. There were seventy Muslims who died in this battle. When they were buried and finished with, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation) up to His words (Endure thou patiently (O Muhammad). Thine endurance is only by (the help of) Allah\ufffd) [16:127]. And so, he was patient and did not mutilate any one\ufffd. Isma'il ibn Ibrahim al-Wa'iz informed us\u003e Abu'l-'Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Isa al-Hafiz\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz\u003e Bishr ibn al-Walid al-Kindi\u003e Salih al-Murri\u003e Sulayman al-Taymi\u003e Abu 'Uthman al-Nahdi\u003e Abu Hurayrah who said: \ufffdWhen the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, got closer to Hamzah, he saw that he was dead. Nothing that he ever saw was more painful to his heart than that sight. He said: \ufffdBy Allah, I will kill seventy of them in return!\ufffd This verse was then revealed (If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted."
