This verse was revealed when the idolaters said: \ufffdMuhammad is mocking his Companions; one day he commands them to do something and the next day he forbids them from doing it, or brings instead something which is easier. He is nothing but a calumniator who says things of his own invention\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse and the verse after it."
