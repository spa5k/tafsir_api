The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdUbayy ibn Khalaf went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, with a decayed bone and said to him: \ufffdO Muhammad, do you think that Allah will bring back to life this decayed bone?\ufffd He said: \ufffdYes, He will, and He will also resurrect you and cast you in hellfire\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed these verses (And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away?...) [36:78-79]\ufffd. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli ibn Abi Bakr al-Faqih\u003e Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn al-Junayd\u003e Ziyad ibn Ayyub\u003e Hushaym\u003e Husayn\u003e Abu Malik who said: \ufffdUbayy ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, with a decayed bone which he crushed in his hand and then said: \ufffdO Muhammad, will Allah resurrect this now that it has become dust?\ufffd He said: \ufffdYes, Allah will resurrect it; he will also make you die, bring you back to life and then cast you in the fire of Gehenna\ufffd. This verse was then revealed\ufffd."
