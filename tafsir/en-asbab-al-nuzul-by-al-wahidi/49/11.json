The latter was hard of hearing and when he came to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, the Companions made room for him in order for him to sit next to the Prophet so that he could hear him. He came one day when people were already seated and started stepping over people, saying: \ufffdMake room! Make room!\ufffd One man said to him: \ufffdYou have found a place, so sit down!\ufffd Thabit sat down but he was angry. He tried to tease the man. He said: \ufffdWho are you?\ufffd The man said: \ufffdSo-and-so\ufffd. Thabit exclaimed: \ufffdWhat, the son of so-and-so\ufffd, and he mentioned his mother about whom they used to taunt him in the pre-Islamic period. The man lowered his head out of embarrassment. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. (\ufffd not let women (deride) women who may be better than they are) [49:11]. This was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who derided Umm Salamah. What happened is that the latter tied her loins with a white dress and spread its extremity behind her such that she dragged it behind her. \ufffdA\ufffdishah said to Hafsah: \ufffdLook at what she is dragging behind her! It looks like a dog\ufffds tongue\ufffd. This was their derision of her. Anas said: \ufffdThis was revealed about the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who made fun of Umm Salamah because she was short. \ufffdIkrimah reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdSafiyyah bint Huyayy ibn Akhtab went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, women revile me, saying: O Jewess, daughter of Jewish parents!\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to her: \ufffdCould you not have said to them in reply: my father is Aaron, my uncle is Moses and my husband is Muhammad\ufffd. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. (\ufffdnor insult one another by nicknames\ufffd) [49:11]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mihrajani informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Battah\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-\ufffdAziz\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Marwazi\u003e Hafs ibn Ghiyath\u003e Dawud ibn Abi Hind\u003e al-Sha\ufffdbi\u003e Abu Jubayrah ibn al-Dahhak\u003e his father and uncles who said: \ufffdThe Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, came to us and, when some men used nicknames to call others, it was said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, those who are called by these nicknames do not like it\ufffd. This verse was then revealed (\ufffdnor insult one another by nicknames\ufffd)\ufffd."
