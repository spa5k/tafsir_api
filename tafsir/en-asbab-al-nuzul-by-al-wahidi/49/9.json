  "text": "(And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them\ufffd) [49:9]. Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar al-Nahwi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Sinan al-Muqri\ufffd\u003e Ahmad ibn \ufffdAli al-Mawsili\u003e Ishaq ibn Abi Isra\ufffdil\u003e Mu\ufffdtamir ibn Sulayman\u003e his father\u003e Anas who related: \ufffdI said: \ufffdO Prophet of Allah, why do you not visit \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy?\ufffd The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, decided to go and visit him. He mounted an ass and the Muslims walked with him. It happened that the ground was full of manure. So when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, reached \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy, the latter said: \ufffdKeep away from me, the staunch of your ass is offending me\ufffd. A man from the Helpers said to him: \ufffdBy Allah, the ass of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, smells better than you\ufffd. One of the men of \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy got angry; then the men of both parties became angry because of what was said. They exchanged blows and hurled leafless palm leaves and sandals at each others. We heard that it is about them that (And if two parties of believers fall to fighting\ufffd) was revealed\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Musaddid and by Muslim from Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-A\ufffdla; both Musaddid and Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-A\ufffdla related it from al-Mu\ufffdtamir."
