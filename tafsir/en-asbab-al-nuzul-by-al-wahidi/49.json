Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim informed us\u003e �Ubayd Allah ibn Muhammad al-�Ukbari\u003e �Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Baghawi\u003e al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sabah\u003e Hajjaj ibn Muhammad\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e Ibn Abi Mulaykah\u003e �Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr who relate that horsemen from the Banu Tamim went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so Abu Bakr said: �Appoint al-Qa�qa� ibn Ma�bad as their leader�, �Umar, on the other hand, said: �No, appoint al-Aqra� ibn Habis as their leader!� Abu Bakr said to �Umar: �You just want to oppose me!� �Umar said: �I do not want to oppose you�, and they argued to the extent that they raised their voices on each other. About this incident, these words of Allah, exalted is He, were revealed: (O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger�) up to His words, glorified is He, (And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them, it had been better for them�) [49:5]. This was narrated by Bukhari from al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sabah."

      "text": "The faithful indeed are siblings. O You who make every existent thing appear! O You who accept every burning sigh! O You whose generosity assures the daily provision of the servants! O You whose kingship is secure from annihilation and disappearance! No one debases the one You have exalted. No one throws down the one You have pulled up. No one can covet the one with Your brand. The faithful have all been branded by You. They have been pulled up by Your compassion and caressed by Your gentleness. In the alternations of created nature and the states of mortal nature, they keep their feet within the circle of duty on the center point of approval. Sometimes like a cypress they are in the station of seclusion in the meadow, sometimes like a polo mallet they are in the station of service. It is they who were caressed by the Lord of the Worlds in the Beginningless, when brother- hood was established among them, for the faithful indeed are siblings. This is a brotherhood that will never be cut off, a kinship that will never be broken, a lineage that will be joined with the End- less. It is to this that the report refers, “Every tie and lineage will be cut on the Day of Resurrection, save my tie and my lineage.” What is meant by this is the lineage of the religion and godwariness, not the lineage of water and clay. If it were the lineage of water and clay, Abū Lahab and Abū Jahl would have a portion of it. It is this to which He alludes with the words, “Surely the noblest of you with God is the most godwary” [49:13]. O chevalier! You know that all the faithful are your brothers and kinsmen in the lineage of faith and godwariness. Attend to the rightful due of brotherhood and the stipulations of kinship. Live in agreeableness with them, choose the road of preferring others and chivalry, and serve them without recompense. If they sin, excuse them. If they are ill, visit them. Put your own portion totally off to the side and increase their portion. This is the rightful due of brotherhood. If you have the head for it, then enter. Otherwise, emigrate. Dhu'l-Nūn was asked, “With whom should we be companions and with whom should we come and go?” He said, “With him who does not own, who does not censure any state of yours, and who does not change when you change."

      "text": "(O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)�) [49:11]. This was revealed about Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas. The latter was hard of hearing and when he came to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, the Companions made room for him in order for him to sit next to the Prophet so that he could hear him. He came one day when people were already seated and started stepping over people, saying: �Make room! Make room!� One man said to him: �You have found a place, so sit down!� Thabit sat down but he was angry. He tried to tease the man. He said: �Who are you?� The man said: �So-and-so�. Thabit exclaimed: �What, the son of so-and-so�, and he mentioned his mother about whom they used to taunt him in the pre-Islamic period. The man lowered his head out of embarrassment. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. (� not let women (deride) women who may be better than they are) [49:11]. This was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who derided Umm Salamah. What happened is that the latter tied her loins with a white dress and spread its extremity behind her such that she dragged it behind her. �A�ishah said to Hafsah: �Look at what she is dragging behind her! It looks like a dog�s tongue�. This was their derision of her. Anas said: �This was revealed about the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who made fun of Umm Salamah because she was short. �Ikrimah reported that Ibn �Abbas said: �Safiyyah bint Huyayy ibn Akhtab went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: �O Messenger of Allah, women revile me, saying: O Jewess, daughter of Jewish parents!� The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to her: �Could you not have said to them in reply: my father is Aaron, my uncle is Moses and my husband is Muhammad�. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse�. (�nor insult one another by nicknames�) [49:11]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mihrajani informed us\u003e Abu �Abd Allah ibn Battah\u003e �Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn �Abd al-�Aziz\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Marwazi\u003e Hafs ibn Ghiyath\u003e Dawud ibn Abi Hind\u003e al-Sha�bi\u003e Abu Jubayrah ibn al-Dahhak\u003e his father and uncles who said: �The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, came to us and, when some men used nicknames to call others, it was said: �O Messenger of Allah, those who are called by these nicknames do not like it�. This verse was then revealed (�nor insult one another by nicknames�)�."

      "text": "(O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female�) [49:13]. Said Ibn 'Abbas: �This was revealed about Thabit ibn Qays when he made a remark about the man who did not make room for him to sit: 'What, the son of so-and-so [referring to his mother]'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'Who mentioned that woman?' Thabit stood up and said: 'I did, O Messenger of Allah!' The Messenger said to him: 'Look at the faces of those present'. And when he looked, he asked him: 'What do you see?' He said: 'I see white, red and black people'. The Prophet said: 'Well, you are not better than any of them unless it be through [the good practice of] religion and God-fearingness'. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse�. Muqatil said: �On the day Mecca was conquered, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, ordered Bilal to climb on the roof of the Ka'bah and perform the call to prayer. 'Attab ibn Asid commented on this: 'Praise be to Allah, that Allah has taken my father to Him and made that he did not see this day'. Al-Harith ibn Hisham said: 'Did Muhammad not find any other caller to prayer except this black raven?' Suhayl ibn 'Amr said: 'Allah willing, he will change him'. Abu Sufyan, on the other hand, said: 'I am not going to make any comment; I am afraid that the Lord of heaven will divulge what I say!' Gabriel, peace be upon him, went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and informed him about what they said. The Prophet summoned them and asked them about what they said and they admitted it. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse warning them against boasting about their lineages and abundance of wealth and against looking down on the poor�. Abu Hassan al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Harun ibn Muhammad al-Istrabadhi\u003e Abu Muhammad Ishaq ibn Muhammad al-Khuza'i\u003e Abu'l-Walid al-Azraqi\u003e his grandfather\u003e 'Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Ward al-Makki\u003e Ibn Abi Mulaykah who said: �On the day Mecca was conquered, Bilal climbed on the roof of the Ka'bah and performed the call to prayer. One person said: 'O servants of Allah! How can this black slave be allowed to perform the call to prayer on top of the Ka'bah?' Another man said: 'If Allah is displeased, He will change him'."

They went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, in Medina because there was drought in that year. They declared themselves to be believers outwardly but disbelievers inwardly. They sullied the streets of Medina with excrement and caused a rise in its prices. They used to say to the Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace: �We have come to you with loads and dependents and refrained to fight against you unlike such-and-such a tribe, so give us alms�. They kept mentioning to him the favours they thought they had done. Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse about them."

      "text": "(O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet�) [49:2]. This verse was revealed about Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas who was hard of hearing and loud. When he spoke with a person he always raised his voice. He might have annoyed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, with his loud voice when he spoke to him. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Muzakki informed us\u003e �Ubayd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Zahid\u003e Abu�l-Qasim al-Baghawi\u003e Qatan ibn Nusayr\u003e Ja�far ibn Sulayman al-Dab�i\u003e Thabit\u003e Anas who said: �When this verse (O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet) was revealed, Thabit ibn Qays said: �I am the one who used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace; I am therefore of the inhabitants of hellfire�. This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he said: �He is rather of the people of the Garden� �. This was narrated by Muslim from Qatan ibn Nusayr. Ibn Abi Mulaykah said: �The best ones, Abu Bakr and �Umar, did almost perish. They raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, when some horsemen from the Banu Tamim came to see him. One of them suggested al-Aqra� ibn Habis [for the leadership of Banu Tamim] while the other suggested another man. Abu Bakr said to �Umar: �You only wanted to oppose me!� �Umar responded: �I did not want to oppose you�, and they raised their voices while arguing with each other. Allah, exalted is He, revealed about this (O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet�)�. Ibn al-Zubayr said: �After this verse was revealed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, could hardly hear what �Umar ibn al-Khattab said to him; he had to ask again about what he said�."

Allah, exalted is He, revealed about Abu Bakr (Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah�)�.

O Muhammad!' Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them have no sense)�. Muhammad ibn Ishaq and others said: �This verse was revealed about some uncouth people from Banu Tamim. A delegation of the Banu Tamim went to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. They entered the mosque and called the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who was in his private apartment: 'O Muhammad, come out to meet us, for our praise is nice while our censure is nasty'. Their shouting annoyed the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so he came out to see them. They said: 'O Muhammad, we have come to brag to you'. Allah, exalted is He, revealed about them (Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them have no sense). Among these people were al-Aqra' ibn Habis, 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn, al-Zibriqan ibn Badr and Qays ibn 'Asim�.

They called him from outside his doorstep: 'O Muhammad, come out to meet us, for our praise is nice while our censure is nasty'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, heard them and came out, saying: 'Indeed, it is only Allah whose praise is nice and censure nasty'. They said: 'We are people from Banu Tamim; we have brought our poet and our orator to show you our excellence over you in poetry and brag about our merits'."

When these people heard of his coming, they came out to receive him out of reverence for Allah, exalted is He, and His Messenger. But he was scared of them and the devil whispered to him that they wanted to kill him. He returned halfway and went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, saying: �Banu�l-Mustaliq have refused to pay the poor-due and wanted to kill me�.
