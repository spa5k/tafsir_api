He used to travel to Persia for trade. He bought the events of non-Arabs and related them to the Quraysh, saying: \ufffdMuhammad relates to you the events of \ufffdAd and Thamud, and I relate to you the events of Rustum and Isfindiyar and the Chosroes\ufffd. They found his tales more entertaining and they shunned listening to the Qur\ufffdan, and so this verse was revealed\ufffd. Mujahid said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about the buying of slave-girls and songstresses\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Muqri\ufffd informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Fadl ibn Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Khuzaymah\u003e his grandfather\u003e \ufffdAli ibn Hujr\u003e Mishma\ufffdill ibn Milhan al-Ta\ufffdi\u003e Muttarih ibn Yazid\u003e \ufffdUbayd Allah ibn Zahr\u003e \ufffdAli ibn Yazid\u003e al-Qasim\u003e Abu Umamah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdIt is forbidden to teach songstresses [to sing] or to sell songstresses, and the price gotten from selling them is unlawful. It is about the like of this that this verse was revealed (And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may mislead from Allah\ufffds way without knowledge\ufffd) up to the end of the verse. No man raises his voice to sing except that Allah, exalted is He, sends him two devils, one on each side, who will keep banging with their feet until it is him who keeps quiet\ufffd. Thuwayr ibn Abi Fakhitah reported from his father that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about a man who bought a slave-girl who sang to him day and night\ufffd."
