  "text": "(And if all the trees in the earth were pens\ufffd) [31:27]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThe Jews asked the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, about the spirit, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (They will ask thee concerning the Spirit. Say: the Spirit is by command of my Lord, and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little) [17:85]. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, migrated to Medina, Jewish doctors went to see him and said: \ufffdO Muhammad, we have been informed that you said (of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little). Are you referring, by this, to us or to your people?\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdThe knowledge that you have is very little in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, glorified is He. Allah, exalted is He, has given you something which will benefit you if only you practise it\ufffd. They said: \ufffdO Muhammad, how can you say this when it is you who says (\ufffd and he unto whom wisdom is given, he truly hath received abundant good\ufffd) [2:269]? How can little knowledge and abundant good be combined together?\ufffd As a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And if all the trees in the earth were pens\ufffd)\ufffd."
