'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abdan informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym\u003e 'Ali ibn Hamshadh\u003e Muhammad ibn Mandah al-Asfahani\u003e Bakr ibn Bakkar\u003e Hamzah ibn Habib\u003e Habib ibn Thabit\u003e Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said, regarding Allah's word (And they forbid (men) from it and avoid it\ufffd): \ufffdIt was revealed about Abu Talib who used to warn the idolaters against harming the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, but, at the same time, kept away from that which was revealed to him\ufffd. This was also the opinion of 'Ata' ibn Dinar and al-Qasim ibn Mukhaymarah. Said Muqatil: \ufffdThis is because the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went to see Abu Talib to invite him to embrace Islam when the Quraysh gathered at Abu Talib's, intending to harm the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. Abu Talib said: By Allah, they will not reach to you with all their numbers \tUntil I am laid buried in the ground. So carry on with you matter unobstructed \tAnd receive a glad tiding and peace of mind. And you have presented a religion which is most certainly \tOne of the best religions on earth. Had it not been for fear of reproach or being insulted \tYou would have found me a firm believer in it. Allah, exalted is He, revealed: (And they forbid (men) from it and avoid it)\ufffd. Said Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, al-Suddi and al-Dahhak: \ufffdThis was revealed about the unbelievers of Mecca. They used to forbid people from following Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, and they themselves stayed away from him\ufffd. This is also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas according to the report of al-Walibi."
