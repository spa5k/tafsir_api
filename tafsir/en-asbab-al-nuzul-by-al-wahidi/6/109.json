Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Fadl informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ya\ufffdqub al-Umawi\u003e Ahmad \ufffdAbd al-Jabbar\u003e Yunus ibn Bukayr\u003e Abu Ma\ufffdshar\u003e Muhammad ibn Ka\ufffdb who said: \ufffdThe Quraysh spoke to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. They said: \ufffdYou inform us that Moses, peace be upon him, had a staff with which he struck a stone and twelve springs gushed forth, and that Jesus, peace be upon him, revived the dead, and that Thamud had a camel; why do you not bring us some of those signs so that we believe in you?\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked them: \ufffdWhat sign do you want me to bring you?\ufffd They said: \ufffdTurn [mount] al-Safa into gold\ufffd. He said: \ufffdWould you believe in me if I did as you ask?\ufffd They said: \ufffdYes, by Allah, if you do, we will all follow you\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, stood up and began supplicating. Then, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to him and said: \ufffdIf you wish, I can turn al-Safa into gold. However, never did I send a sign that people disbelieved in except that I sent chastisement after it. If you wish, I will leave them until some of them decide to repent\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdLeave them until some of them decide to repent\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And they swear a solemn oath by Allah that if there come unto them a portent they will believe therein) up to His words (\ufffd they would not believe unless Allah so willed\ufffd) [6:111]\ufffd."
