Abu Salih reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdAbu Sufyan ibn Harb, al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah, al-Nadr ibn al-Harith, \ufffdUtbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi\ufffdah and Umayyah and Ubayy the sons of Khalaf listened to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, [reciting the Qur\ufffdan], and so they asked al-Nadr: \ufffdO Abu Qutaylah, what does Muhammad (s)ay?\ufffd He said: \ufffdBy Him who has made it [the Ka\ufffdbah ] His House, I do not know what he is saying, except that I see his lips moving, muttering something. But what he says is nothing but the fables of the people of old, like the stories I used to relate to you regarding bygone nations\ufffd. Al-Nadr used to talk abundantly about bygone nations. He used to relate this to the Quraysh who listened to what he had to say. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
