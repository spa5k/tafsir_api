Abu Sa\ufffdid al-Nasruyiyy informed us\u003e Abu Bakr al-Qati\ufffdi\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e his father\u003e Abu Mu\ufffdawiyah\u003e Abu Ishaq al-Shaybani\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdUbayd Allah al-Thaqafi\u003e Sa\ufffdd ibn Abi Waqqas who said: \ufffdOn the day of Badr my brother \ufffdUmayr was killed and I killed Sa\ufffdid ibn al-\ufffdAs and took his sword which was named al-Kifah. I went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he told me to go and put the sword with the captured booty which was still undivided. I went back in a state which only Allah knew as a result of the killing of my brother and the loss of my spoil. I did not go very far when Surah al-Anfal was revealed. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called me and said: \ufffdGo and take back your sword!\ufffd \ufffd. \ufffdIkrimah reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdOn the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhoever does such-and-such will get such-and-such\ufffd. And so the younger men went and the old remained under the banners. When it was time to divide the booty, those younger men came to ask for their share, but the old said: \ufffdDo not exclude us, for we were under the banners, and if you had been defeated, we would have been a shield for you\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (They ask thee (O Muhammad) of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to Allah and the messenger\ufffd), and the booty was divided on them in equal shares\ufffd. Abu Bakr ibn al-Harith informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e Sahl ibn \ufffdUthman\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Za\ufffdidah\u003e Ibn Abi al-Zinad\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith\u003e Sulayman ibn Musa ibn al-Ashdaq\u003e Makhul\u003e Abu Salam al-Bahili\u003e Abu Umamah al-Bahili\u003e \ufffdUbadah ibn al-Samit who said: \ufffdWhen the enemy was defeated on the day of Badr, a group of men followed them to exterminate them, while one group surrounded the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, [to protect him] and another group seized the booty and spoils. When Allah banished the enemy and those who went after came back, they said: \ufffdThe booty belongs to us, we have chased the enemy and it is through us that Allah has defeated and banished them\ufffd."
