Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn al-Fadl al-Tajir\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Ya'qub ibn Ibrahim ibn Sa'd\u003e his father\u003e Salih\u003e Ibn Shihab\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Tha'labah ibn Su'ayr who said: \ufffdThe person who sought judgment was Abu Jahl. He said when the two armies met: 'O Allah, destroy this day whoever amongst us has severed ties of kinship and brought that which we had never known!' This was the judgement that he sought. Allah, exalted is He, revealed regarding this ((O Quraysh!) If ye sought a judgment, now hath the judgment come unto you\ufffd) up to His words (Allah is with the believers)\ufffd. This was narrated by al-Hakim Abu 'Abd Allah in his Sahih from al-Qati'i from the son of Ibn Hanbal from Ahmad ibn Hanbal from Ya'qub. Said al-Suddi and al-Kalbi: \ufffdBefore they set off to fight the Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, in Uhud, the idolaters grabbed the covers of the Ka'bah and prayed: 'O Allah, give victory to the greatest of the two armies, the most guided of the two camps, the noblest of the two parties and the best of the two religions', and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. 'Ikrimah said: \ufffdThe idolaters said: 'O Allah, we do not recognize that which Muhammad has brought, so judge between us with the truth', and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse (If ye sought a judgment\ufffd)\ufffd."
