  "text": "(It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land\ufffd) [8:67-69]. Said Mujahid: \ufffdIt happened that some of that which was revealed from heaven agreed with many of 'Umar's opinions. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, consulted the Muslims about the prisoners of Badr, they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, they are your cousins, so free them in exchange for a ransom'. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said: 'No, O Messenger of Allah, you should kill them'. Then this verse was revealed (It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land)\ufffd. Said Ibn 'Umar: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, consulted Abu Bakr regarding the prisoners of Badr, and the latter said: 'They are your people and clan, let them go!' But when he consulted 'Umar, the latter said: 'Kill them'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, freed them in exchange for a ransom. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land) up to his words (Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good\ufffd) [8:69]. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, met 'Umar, he said to him: 'We almost incurred a misfortune as a result of opposing your view!' \ufffd Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Husayn al-Hiri informed us\u003e Hajib ibn Ahmad\u003e Muhammad ibn Hammad\u003e Abu Mu'awiyah\u003e al-A'mash\u003e 'Amr ibn Murrah\u003e Abu 'Ubaydah\u003e 'Abd Allah who said: \ufffdWhen the prisoners were brought on the Day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'What do you think we should do with these prisoners?' Abu Bakr said: 'O Messenger of Allah, these are your people and kin, spare them and wait that haply Allah, glorious and majestic is He, may relent on them'. 'Umar, on the other hand said: 'They have given you the lie and expelled you, bring them forward and chop their heads off'. 'Abd Allah ibn Rawahah said: 'Look for a valley with abundant wood and burn them there', upon which al-'Abbas commented: 'You have severed your ties of kinship!' The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer them and then went in."
