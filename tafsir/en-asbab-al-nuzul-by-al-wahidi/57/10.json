Muhammad ibn Fudayl reported that al-Kalbi related that this verse was revealed about Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be well pleased with him. This is evidenced by the report which was related to us from Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abdihi ibn Yahya\u003e Abu'l-Hasan Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Saliti\u003e 'Uthman ibn Sulayman al-Baghdadi\u003e Ya'qub ibn Ibrahim al-Makhzumi\u003e 'Amr ibn Hafs al-Shaybani\u003e al-'Ala' ibn 'Amr\u003e Abu Ishaq al-Fazari\u003e Sufyan al-Thawri\u003e Adam ibn 'Ali\u003e Ibn 'Umar who said: \ufffdAs the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting with Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, who was wearing a cloak which he gathered round his chest with pins, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came down, conveyed Allah's greetings of peace to him and said: 'O Muhammad, why is Abu Bakr wearing a cloak which he gathers round his chest with pins?' He said: 'O Gabriel, he has spent all his wealth before the conquest [of Mecca]!' He said: 'In that case, convey to him Allah's greetings of peace, glorified and exalted is He, and tell him that your Lord asks you: are you pleased with Me in your state of poverty or are you indignant?' The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, addressed Abu Bakr: 'O Abu Bakr, Gabriel is here to convey the greetings of peace of Allah, glorified and exalted is He, and He is asking you: are you pleased with Him in your state of poverty or are you indignant?' Upon hearing this, Abu Bakr wept and said: 'How can I be indignant with my Lord? I am pleased with my Lord! I am pleased with my Lord!' \ufffd"
