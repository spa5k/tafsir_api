Muqatil said: \ufffdAbu Jahl and al-Nadr ibn al-Harith said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: 'You have become distressed because of leaving our religion'. They said this because they saw him immersed in worship for long times and striving hard. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us\u003e Abu'l-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e al-'Askari\u003e Abu Malik\u003e Juwaybir\u003e al-Dahhak who said: \ufffdWhen the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, he and his Companions stood up to pray. The unbelievers of Quraysh said: 'This Qur'an was only revealed to Muhammad to make him distressed'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Ta. Ha), He says: O man (We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an that thou shouldst be distressed)\ufffd."
