The lord of lords, the master of all masters, the gentle, generous, and lovingly kind, takes care of the work of the weak in a way that leaves all the strong in wonder. A hundred thousand proximate angels, glorifying and hallowing, were diving in the oceans of bows and prostrations and raising the voices of glorification and hallowing at the Exalted Threshold, but no one talked about them. But that poor, weak woman-the disputer who wept before the Threshold in burning and bewilderment and who complained of her despair-look how the Splendorous Qur'an wrote the inscription of exaltation on the cape of her secret whis- pering: “God has heard the words of her who disputes with thee concerning her husband and complains to God. We have heard her complaint, We have listened to her lamenting and supplicat- ing, and We have made apparent the opening up of the suffering and tightness in which she has remained because of her husband's repudiation of her. We are the Lord who is the good companion of everyone helpless and without a companion, We untie the knots of everyone in bonds, We dispel the sorrows of everyone sorrowful. We hear the voice of the poor, We listen to the whispering of the miserable, We respond to the need of the helpless.” It has come in a report that one day this woman who disputed came to ʿUmar KhaṬṬāb during the days of his caliphate for a business she had with him. She spoke harshly with him. Those who were with him shouted at her, saying, “Do you not know that you must not speak harsh words to the Commander of the Faithful?” ʿUmar said to them, “Be silent! Have respect for this poor woman! She is the woman whose words the Real heard from beyond the seven levels of heaven, and upon whom He placed this caress and generosity: “God has heard the words of her who disputes with thee concerning her husband and complains to God.” O Muslims! Respect the poor and seek proximity to God by taking care of them and giving comfort to them. Although today they are helpless and poor, tomorrow they will be the kings of the Garden of Refuge and the great ones of the Highest Paradise."

      "text": "(O ye who believe! when it is said unto you, Make room! in assemblies, then make room; Allah will make way for you (hereafter)�) [58:11]. Said Muqatil: �The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was at al-Suffah. The place was not spacious and it was a Friday. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had the habit of honouring those who had taken part in the Battle of Badr from among the Emigrants and the Helpers. Some of those who had participated in Badr came to the gathering and found that people were already there before them. They stood, therefore, facing toward the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, waiting for people to make room for them. But no one made room for them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was pained to see this and so he said to those around him who did not take part in Badr: �So-and-so get up, and you get up�, and he moved as many people as the number of those who were standing among the Companions who participated in the Battle of Badr. Those who were asked to vacate their seats were not pleased and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, saw their displeasure on their faces. Then, the hypocrites said to the Muslims: �Did you not claim that your man deals fairly with people? By Allah, he has not been fair with these people. He removed people who wanted to be close to their Prophet from places in which they were already sitting and seated in their stead people who came late!� Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed this verse�."

It is narrated that the Commander of the Faithful ʿAlī said that when this verse came down, he gave one dinar in charity and asked ten questions from God's Messenger. He said, “'O Messenger of God! How should I supplicate God?': How should I call upon God and worship Him?” The Messenger answered, “'With truthfulness and loyalty': Be loyal to the covenant that was made with Him on the Day of Alast and be truthful in your speaking and doing. Have what you show, do what you say, and be whence you call out.” ʿAlī said, “What should I ask for from God?” He answered, “'For safety in this world and the next:' In this world and the next the safety of the heart from the blights of mortal nature and the well-being of the body in the varieties of trial.” ʿAlī said, “'What should I make ready for my salvation?': What should I do so that in the gathering place of the resurrection I may be delivered, secure from the terrors of the resurrection and arrived at the degrees of the Garden?” He answered, “'Eat the permitted and speak with truthfulness': When you eat something, eat the permitted, and when you speak, speak with truthfulness. Do not give the forbidden access to yourself, for the forbidden has a bad outcome. Avoid lying, for anyone who lies will have a bad name in the two worlds.” He said, “'What is the stratagem?': What stratagem should I use so that things will come out as I want?” He answered, “'The stratagem is to abandon stratagems': Let go of stratagems and know that everything is as God wants and that the stratagems and governance of the servant will never over- come God's predetermination.” He said, “'What must I do?': What are the rules that I must discharge?” He answered, “'The command of God and His Messenger': Everything mandatory and oblig- atory commanded by God, and everything set down as Sunnah and recommended by the Mes- senger.” He said, “'What is ease?': What is ease and comfort?” He answered, “'The Garden': Ease is that you settle down in paradise and its blessings and that you stay secure from hell and its punishment."

      "text": "(O ye who believe! When ye hold conference with the messenger�) [58:12-13]. Muqatil ibn Hayyan said: �This was revealed about the rich. This is because they used to go to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and converse with him at length. In this fashion, they always beat the poor to the assemblies to the extent that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, disliked their prolonged sitting and conference. Allah, glorified and exalted is He, therefore revealed this verse and commanded that alms be given upon each conference with the Prophet. As for those who had straitened means, they did not have anything to give for alms, while those who were well off were niggardly. The Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, found this tough and so a dispensation was revealed�. �Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, said: �There is one verse in the Book of Allah that no one has applied before me nor is there anyone who has applied it after me. [It is] (O ye who believe! When ye hold conference with the messenger�). I had a piece of gold which I exchanged for silver pieces and whenever I conferred with the Messenger I spent one silver piece in charity until I spent them all. Then the verse was abrogated with another verse (Fear ye to offer alms before your conference?... and they will fancy that they have some standing. Lo! is it not they who are the liars?) [58:13]�."

She said: 'He put me away, declaring me to be as his mother, when I grew old and my strength failed'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed the verse of putting one's wife away, declaring her to be as one's mother. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to Aws: 'You have to free one slave'. He said: 'I cannot afford it!' The Prophet said: 'Then you have to fast two consecutive months'. Aws said: 'If I fail to eat twice a day, my sight suffers'. The Prophet said: 'Then you have to feed sixty needy people'. Aws said: 'I cannot do it unless you help me'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, helped him with fifteen measures (sa') [of dates] and Allah enabled him to gather what was necessary to feed sixty needy people, and Allah is merciful - they were of the opinion that Aws already had with him fifteen measures, in order to feed sixty needy people�.

This is because the latter used to talk secretly amongst themselves to the exclusion of the believers and then look at the believers and wink at each other. When the believers saw their secret communications, they said: �We think that they are doing this because they received news about our relatives and brothers who went out in military expeditions. They have been killed, wounded or defeated�. But when these secret conversations continued, they complained to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he commanded them not to speak in secret to the exclusion of the believers. They did not heed his command and went back to secret conversations among themselves. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed this verse.

He said: 'Do you not see that I have sent back to them what they said. I said: the same to you'.
