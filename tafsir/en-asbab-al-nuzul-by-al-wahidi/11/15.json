But the sweetness of its perfection will be followed by the bitterness of its disappearance. The flavor of its honey will be succeeded by the poison of its colocynth. \" When someone wants this world from Me, this world will not be held back from him, but he will be helpless in the next world, and this world also will not stay with him. \" It is mentioned in the traditions that whoever turns his face towards this world has turned his back on God. Turning one's back on God is to sleep always with thoughts of this world and to wake with thoughts of this world while one's moments are drowned in them. A poor wretch like this does not know that this world is the enjoyment of delusion [3:185]. It is the carpet of playing and jesting, the toy of the ignorant and the cause of their deception. He who keeps to this world is like a traveler sitting in a ship, this world his traveling supplies. If he takes more supplies than he needs, the ship will sink and cause his destruction. It is said that Dhu'l-Qarnayn went to the land of the west, and the kingdom of that region was held by a woman. Dhu'l-Qarnayn said, \" Surrender this kingdom to me. \" She said, \" No! And there is no honor in it. \" He wanted to take the kingdom by severity, but he was ashamed to fight against a woman. The woman said, \" I invite you to be my guest. After the invitation is completed, I will surrender the kingdom to you. \" When he came to the table, he saw a table laden with gold. All the cups were gold, and in place of food there were pearls and gems. Dhu'l-Qarnayn said, \" What will I eat? I need food. None of this is fit for eating. \" The woman said, \" Since your portion of this world is no more than bread, where will you take the kingdom of the earth? It is fitting that you have no kingdom, for your portion is no more than two loafs of bread."
