Master Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr ibn Matar\u003e Ibrahim ibn 'Ali\u003e Yahya ibn Yahya\u003e Abu'l-Ahwas\u003e Simak\u003e Ibrahim\u003e 'Alqamah\u003e al-Aswad\u003e 'Abd Allah who said: \ufffdA man came to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have fondled a woman at the end of Medina. However, I have touched her without making love to her; here I am, sentence me to whatever judgment you see fit!' 'Umar exclaimed: 'Allah had concealed your sin if only you had kept it concealed'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer him. The man left. Another man went after him, called him back and recited to him this verse. One man asked: 'O Messenger of Allah, is this for him specifically?' He said: 'No, it is for all people' \ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim from Yahya ibn Yahya and by Bukhari from Yazid ibn Zuray'. 'Amr ibn Abi 'Amr informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Makki\u003e Muhammad ibn Yusuf\u003e Muhammad ibn Isma'il\u003e Bishr ibn Yazid ibn Zuray'\u003e Sulayman al-Taymi\u003e Abu 'Uthman al-Nahdi\u003e Ibn Mas'ud who reported that a man kissed a woman after which he went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and informed him of what he did. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse (Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night\ufffd) up to the end of the verse. The man asked: \ufffdDoes this apply specifically to me?\ufffd He said: \ufffdIt applies to whoever practises it from among my community\ufffd. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Fadl informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Umawi\u003e al-'Abbas al-Duri\u003e Ahmad ibn Hanbal al-Marwazi\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Mubarak\u003e Suwayd\u003e 'Uthman ibn Mawhab\u003e Musa ibn Talhah\u003e Abu'l-Yusr ibn 'Amr who said: \ufffdA woman whose husband was sent with an army by the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, came to me and said: 'I want to buy one silver coin worth of dates'. I liked the woman and so I said: 'I have in the house dates which are much better than these, so come with me'. I touched her and kissed her."
