Al-Hasan and Qatadah said: \ufffdThe Jews said: \ufffdAllah created the creation in six days and rested on the seventh, Saturday\ufffd, which they call the Sabbath, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tamimi informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar al-Hafiz\u003e Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Hannad ibn al-Sari\u003e Abu Bakr ibn \ufffdAyyash\u003e Abu Sa\ufffdd al-Baqqal\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdThe Jews came to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and asked him about the creation of the heavens and earth. He said to them: \ufffdAllah created the earth on Sunday and Monday; He created the mountains [and what they contain of benefits] on Tuesday; He created the trees and water on Wednesday; He created heaven on Thursday; on Friday, He created the stars, sun and moon\ufffd. \ufffdAnd what after that, O Muhammad?\ufffd the Jews asked. He said: \ufffdThen, He established Himself on the Throne\ufffd. They said: \ufffdYou would have answered correctly, if you added: and then He rested\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was furious. This verse was then revealed (And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us. Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say) [50:38-39]\ufffd."
