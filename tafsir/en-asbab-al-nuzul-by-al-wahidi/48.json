      "text": "Surely We opened up for thee a clear opening. There are several surahs in the Qur'an that begin with surely We [innā]: Surely We sent it down [97:1], Surely We sent [71:1], Surely We gave thee [108:1], Surely We opened up for thee. “The one abandoned by the Threshold, ʿAzāzīl, said, 'I am better' [38:76], and We wreaked havoc on him. We gave his 70,000 years of obedience and service to the wind of unneediness and placed the brand of abandonment and deprivation on his liver. The unaided Pharaoh said, 'Does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me?' [43:51], and We isolated him from blessing, kingship, and pomp and We killed him with water. Korah said, 'because of a knowledge that I have' [28:78], and We cut off his head with the sword of severity and took him upside-down into the earth. The angels said, 'And We glorify' [2:30]. We burned thousands of them in the fire of majesty so that the world's folk would know that other than We, no one can say 'I' or 'We,' for We are the Lord. It is We who are worthy of Lordhood and We who know God-work. We are one in Essence, peerless in attributes, possessor of exaltedness and magnificence, tremendousness and splendor. 'Magnificence is My cloak and tremendousness My shawl; if anyone contends with Me in either, I will put him in the Fire.'”"

      "text": "(And He it is Who hath withheld me�s hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them�) [48:24]. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn �Isa ibn �Amrawayh\u003e Ibrahim ibn Muhammad\u003e Muslim\u003e �Amr al-Naqid\u003e Yazid ibn Harun\u003e Hammad ibn Salamah\u003e Thabit\u003e Anas who reported that eighty men from Mecca came down mount al-Tan�im intending to take on the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and his Companions by surprise. However, he captured them and spared their lives, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And He it is Who hath withheld men�s hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them, after He had made you victors over them). �Abd Allah ibn Mughaffal al-Muzani said: �We were with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, at al-Hudaybiyyah close to the base of the tree which was mentioned in the Qur�an when thirty armed youths suddenly charged on us. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, prayed against them, and Allah, exalted is He, took away their sight. We then bounced on them and seized them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked them: �Have you come under the protection of someone? Has anyone given you a guarantee of safety?� They said: �No, by Allah!� He let them go after which Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And He it is Who hath withheld men�s hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them�)�."

Sa�id ibn Muhammad al-Muqri� informed us\u003e Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Madini\u003e Ahmad ibn �Abd al-Rahman al-Saqati\u003e Yazid ibn Harun\u003e Hammam\u003e Qatadah\u003e Anas who said: �When the verses (Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory that Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to come�) were revealed, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: �Congratulations, O Messenger of Allah, for what Allah has given you; but what do we get?� And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow)�. Muhammad ibn �Abd al-Rahman al-Faqih informed us\u003e Abu �Amr ibn Abi Hafs\u003e Ahmad ibn �Ali al-Mawsili\u003e �Abd Allah ibn �Umar\u003e Yazid ibn Zuray�\u003e Sa�id ibn Qatadah who said: �The verse (Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory) was revealed to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, upon his return from al-Hudaybiyyah. It was revealed when his Companions were sad because they were prevented from performing the pilgrimage; they had to do with offering their sacrifices at al-Hudaybiyyah. When this verse was revealed, the Prophet said to his Companions: �A verse was revealed to me which is better than the whole world�. And when he recited it, one man said: �Congratulations, O Messenger of Allah! Allah has told what will be done with you. But what will be done with us?� And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow)�."
