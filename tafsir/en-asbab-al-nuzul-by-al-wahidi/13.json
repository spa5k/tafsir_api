      "text": "Alif Lām Mīm RāÌ This is one of the secrets of love, one of the treasures of recognition. In the midst of their spirits, the friends have a deposit, but they do not know what they have. The wonder is that they keep on seeing an ocean and they weep in hope for a drop. This is like the Pir of the Tariqah said: “O God, Your stream is flowing-how long will I be thirsty? What sort of thirst is this that I see one cup after another? “Who has ever had a state rarer than this? I'm thirsty and clear water is flowing before me. “Exalted of the two worlds! How much will You be hidden, how much apparent? My heart is bewildered, the spirit distracted. How long this curtaining and self-disclosing? When at last will there be the everlasting self-disclosure?” The allusion is that today the friends have nothing more than the scent of the lights of those secrets and the whiffs of those traces, and that, other than MuḤammad the Arab, no one is worthy of that face-to-face vision. First He alludes to the road of recognition for the elect, since their gaze is on the Essence and the attributes, which are called “the World of the Command.” Then He uncovers the road of recog- nizing Himself for the common people. He knows that their gaze does not pass beyond the newly arrived things, the engendered beings, and the World of Creation. He says,"

Nasr ibn Abi Nasr al-Wa'iz informed us\u003e Abu Sa'id 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Nusayr\u003e Muhammad ibn Ayyub al-Razi\u003e 'Abd al-Wahhab\u003e 'Ali ibn Abi Sarah al-Shaybani\u003e Thabit\u003e Anas ibn Malik who reported that once the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a man to one of the Arab tyrants, saying: �Go and tell him to come and see me�. He said: �O Messenger of Allah, he is too haughty to comply�. He said: �Go and tell him to come and see me�. The man went and said to him: �The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asks you to come and see him�. The man retorted: �What is Allah? Is He made of gold, silver or copper?� The man went back and informed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, saying: �I told you that he is too haughty to comply�. He said: �Go to him a second time and ask him to come and see me�. He went and the man repeated exactly what he said in the previous occasion. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked the man to go and call him a third time, and the man repeated what he said in the two previous occasions. The man said: �As he was talking to me, Allah sent above his head a cloud which thundered and a bolt of lightning struck him and removed his skull�. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath). According to the reports of Abu Salih, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd, Ibn 'Abbas said: �This verse and the verse before it were revealed about 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl and Arbad ibn Rabi'ah. These two men went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and, as they were coming, one of the prophetic Companions said: 'O Messenger of Allah, here is 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl coming toward you'. He said: 'Leave him, Allah will guide him if He wants good for him'. He proceeded along until he stood in front of the Prophet and said: 'O Muhammad, what do I get if I become Muslim?' He said: 'You get what the Muslims get and you suffer what they suffer'."

      "text": "To God prostrate themselves all in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. In the tongue of commentary, the prostration of the unbeliever is an unwilling prostration, for he prostrates himself and shows humility at the time of tribulation in the state of hardship so as to repel harm from himself. Thus MuṣṬafā said to Ḥaṣīn Khuzāʿī,1 \" How many gods do you wor- ship today? \" He said, \" Seven: one in heaven and six in the earth. \" He said, \" Which one of them do you look to on the day of your hope and fear? \" He said, \" The one in heaven. \" According to these words, when someone prostrates himself to a god wanting to attract a benefit or repel a harm, that is a prostration of unwillingness, not a prostration of willingness. The willing prostration is the one done for the command alone and to venerate the Real's exaltedness. There is no taint of wanting, no hope for compensation, and no dread of tribulation. The individual is in prostration, the heart in finding, the spirit in witnessing; the individual is with loyalty, the heart with shame, and the spirit with limpidness. That chieftain of the Tariqah, Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī, was addressed in a dream: \" 'O Abū Yazīd, Our storehouses are full of worship. Approach Us with brokenness and abasement.' In Our thresh- old, bowing and prostrating are of no use without brokenness of the heart and limpidness of the spirit, for the storehouses of Our exaltedness are already full of the bowing and prostrating of the lords of the heart. When you come to Our threshold, place the heart's pain in the spirit's cup and send it to the Presence of the Beloved, for the heart's pain has measure with Us. \" The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" The tawḤīd of the hearts of the faithful is in the measure of the heart's pain. The more a heart is burnt and the more complete its pain, the more it is familiar with tawḤīd and the closer it is to the Real. \" Without the perfection of burning pain, don't mention religion's name. Without the beauty of yearning for union, don't lean on faith."

      "text": "He sends down from heaven water, and the wadis flow in their measure, and the flood carries a swelling scum. And from that which they kindle in fire, wanting ornament or ware, arises a scum the like of it. Thus does God strike truth and falsehood. As for the scum, it van- ishes as jetsam, and what profits people abides in the earth. Abū Bakr WāsiṬī said that this verse is the pivot of knowledge of the Haqiqah and recognition. \" The meaning is that He revealed from on high to the hearts and ears of the prophets and He in- spired the intellects and insights of the wise. \" The majestic Unity, through the attribute of mercy and clemency, sent down from heaven to the messengers the true message and the pure revelation. They heard it with their ears and they perceived it with their hearts. In the same way He inspired the friends and threw the light of wis- dom into their hearts. And the wadis flow in their measure, that is, He made the hearts see in the measure of their capacity, life, and illumination. The hearts of the prophets became clear and bright through the light of revelation and messengerhood, and the hearts of the friends with the lamp of wisdom and recognition. In their measure, that is, each person in his own measure, in degrees and grades-one higher, one middling, one lower-the relative preference and disparity being apparent to everyone. About the messengers He says, \" We made some of the prophets more excellent than others \" [17:55]. About the friends He says, \" They are degrees with God \" [3:163]. One has messengerhood in ad- dition to prophethood, another has prophethood in addition to wisdom, another has recognition in addition to knowledge, another has tasting the Reality in addition to faith and bearing witness, another has the knowledge of certainty along with explication, another has the truth of certainty along with face-to-face vision. He gave to each person what was fitting, and He placed within each heart that for which there was room. And the flood carries a swelling scum, that is, He caused loss to those hearts with erroneous views, lowly lapses, and the wishes that Satan casts, what he steals from memory, his casting of slips."

      "text": "God is He who lifted up the heavens without pillars that you see. Heaven and earth, land and see, air and space, are the World of Creation, the playing field of the gaze of the creatures, whose end is apparent and which can disappear. But the World of the Command can never have an end, for it is necessarily continuous. As long as a man does not pass beyond the World of Creation, he will not be given access to the World of the Command. The che- valiers whose gaze travels in the World of the Command are the Pegs of the earth. Just as in respect of form the world's mountains keep the earth in place, so also in respect of meaning the chevaliers keep the world standing. \" Through them rain falls and through them provision is given. \" This is why the Lord of the Worlds says,"

      "text": "Those who have faith and whose hearts are serene in the remembrance of God. The hearts of one group are serene in the remembrance of God, and the hearts of another group are serene in God's remembrance of them: And surely God's remembrance is greater [29:45]. In the tongue of the folk of allusion, this verse reports about two people, one the desirer and the other the desired. One keeps his hours immersed in the remembrance of the tongue, sometimes prayer, sometimes glorification, and sometimes recitation of the Qur'an. The other is joyful with the remembrance of the Real in the midst of the spirit because he is drowned in the ocean of face- to-face vision. He does not attend to the remembrance of the tongue, but keeps on saying, \" O God, as long as I remember Your remembrance, my spirit laments at all remembrance. As long as my heart is happy with Your apparentness, the happiness of the two worlds is but wind. \" The first travels on the road of the religion, kept in the bonds of his own remembrance, and it is said to him, \" Preserve the remembrance and give ear to the commands and prohibitions. \" The other is on the carpet of proximity, snatched away from causes and creation and singled out for the divine attraction, and it is said to the remembrance, \" Give ear to him. \" This is just like one group hop- ing for paradise, while paradise itself is hoping for another group. That is in the Prophet's words, \" Surely the Garden yearns for four individuals: the one who fasts Ramadan, the one who recites the Qur'an, the one who protects the tongue, and the one who feeds the hungry. \" It has also been narrated that the Garden yearns for Salmān. The desirer's eyes have come upon this: \" Remember Me! \" [2:152]. The desired has been shown this: \" I will remember you \" [2:152]. The desired is seeking remembrance, and remem- brance is seeking the desired. The desirer is seeking the present moment, and the present moment is seeking the desired. The desirer is seeking the heart, and the heart is seeking the desired. The field of the desirer's gaze is the world of setting forth in the wrap of createdness, and the field of the desired's gaze is the air of unity and the space of solitariness."

In terms of the allusion and intimation of the Folk of the Haqiqah He is saying, \" It is He who spread out the earth and placed within it the Pegs, namely the friends and masters among His servants, to whom recourse is had and from whom assistance comes. \" The sun rises in the east and sets in the west for a hundred years before someone's eyes are daubed with the collyrium of the Haqiqah by the pencil of solicitude. Perhaps we will be allowed to see those chevaliers and reach endless felicity with one look at them. For thousands of years the moon-faced beauties of Firdaws and the houris of paradise have been standing in wait in that busy bazaar: When will the fortunate procession of those chevaliers be conveyed to the highest of the High Chambers so that they, as hangers-on, may step into the pageant of good fortune at an Omnipotent King [54:55]. On the day Junayd's bier was carried, a bird came and sat on the edge of his coffin. People were waving their hands at it but it would not leave. Ruwaym said, \" In generosity the bird is telling us with the tongue of its state, 'Leave me alone, for my claws have been fixed to the edge of his coffin with the nails of passion. Today this frame of Junayd is the portion of the cherubim. If not for the intrusion of your tumult, you would fly with me like falcons in this air.' \" When they buried him, one of the poor stood above him and recited these verses: \" Oh the grief at separation from a group who are lamps and fortresses, rain clouds, cities, and unshaking mountains, good, security, and stillness. The nights will not change for us until they are brought forth by fate. So every fire belongs to our hearts, every water belongs to our eyes. \""

The commentators of the Qur�an said: �This verse was revealed at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah when they were about to write the document of the treaty. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to �Ali: �Write in the Name of Allah, the Beneficent (al-Rahman), the Merciful�. Sahl ibn �Amr and the idolaters said: �We do not know anyone by the name of the beneficent (al-Rahman) except the ruler of al-Yamamah�, meaning Musaylimah the liar, �rather, write: in Your Name, O Allah!� This is how the people of the pre-Islamic period used to write. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about them this verse�. Said ibn �Abbas, according to the report of al-Dahhak: �This was revealed about the unbelievers of Quraysh when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them (� Adore the Beneficent! They say; And what is the Beneficent? Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us?) [25:60], and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. He said (Say) to them, the Beneficent Whom you deny (He is my Lord; there is no god save Him�)�."

Pray Allah to move for us these mountains, and cause rivers to spring out from this land so that we can use it as plantations, and eat from them. Alternately, pray that Allah brings our dead ancestors to life so that we speak with them; or pray that Allah turns this rock beneath you into gold so that we can do without the winter and summer trips. Don't you claim that you are like these prophets?' We were around him, when the revelation came to him. After he regained his normal composure, he said: 'By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, He has given me all what you have asked, and if I wished it will all happen. However, He has made me choose between the gate of mercy, such that your believers will come to believe or to leave you to what you have chosen for yourselves such that you go astray from the gate of mercy, and your believers will not believe. I have chosen the gate of mercy and that your believers will come to believe. Allah also informed me that if He were to give what you asked for and you disbelieved after that, He would punish you with a chastisement the like of which He has never inflicted on anyone of His creation'. It was revealed (Naught hindreth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel- a clear portent- but they did wrong in respect of her�) [17:59]. He read the next three verses and then the revelation came (Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or the earth to be torn asunder�)�."

      "text": "He effaces whatsoever He will, and He affirms. Know that the highway of the Real's religion is three things: submission, the Sunnah, and self- purification. In submission be fearful, in the Sunnah be hopeful, and in self-purification be a lover. Submission has no escape from fear, the Sunnah must have hope, and self-purification is nothing but the foundation of the lover. To the fearful it is said, \" Be afraid! \" To the hopeful it is said, \" Keep on seeking! \" To the lover it is said, \" Keep on burning! \" In the end the address will come to the fearful, \" Fear not! [41:30]. Do not fear, for the days of fear have come to an end. \" To the hopeful will be said, \" Grieve not! [41:30]. Have no sorrow, for your hope has been reached and the tree of joy has grown. \" To the lovers will be said, \" Rejoice! [41:30]. Be happy, for the night of separation has ended and the morning of union has come. \" Each of these things has its own path of effacement and affirmation in the world. From the hearts of the fearful He erases eye-service and puts certainty, He erases stinginess and puts gen- erosity, He erases avarice and puts contentment, He erases envy and puts tenderness, He erases innovation and puts the Sunnah, He erases fright and puts security. From the hearts of the hopeful He erases free choice and deposits surrender, He erases disper- sion and deposits togetherness, He erases perplexity and deposits the precedent light. From the hearts of the lovers He erases the customs of human nature and deposits the marks bearing witness to the Haqiqah, He decreases the marks bearing witness to the servant and in- creases the marks bearing witness to Himself. Then, just as he was at first, so also he will be at last. The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" O God, the majesty of Your exaltedness left no room for allu- sions. Your effacing and affirming took away the path of ascription-I lost all that I had in hand. O God, Yours kept on increasing and mine decreasing until at last there remained only what there was at first. \" Tribulation lies only in the makeup of my water and clay."
