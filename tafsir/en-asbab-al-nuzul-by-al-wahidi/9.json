Ibn al-Walibi reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: �This verse was revealed about some people who failed to join the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, at the Battle of Tabuk and then regretted it, saying: 'We are enjoying shelter and shade with the women while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and his Companions are engaging in Jihad. By Allah, we shall tie ourselves to the columns [of the mosque] and remain tied until the Messenger himself unties and pardons us'. And they tied themselves to the columns of the mosque. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, returned from the battle, he passed by them and asked about who they were. He was told: 'These are the people who failed to join you. They vowed to remain in their position until you untie them yourself'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'And I swear that I will not set them free until I am commanded to do so nor will I pardon them unless it is Allah Who pardons them first. They have failed to join me and shunned fighting alongside the Muslims'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. When it was revealed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent for them, freed them and pardoned them. When they were freed, they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, these are our riches which caused us to fail to join you, spend them on charity on our behalves to purify us and ask forgiveness for us'. He said: 'I was not commanded to take anything from your riches'. Allah, glorious and majestic is He, then revealed (Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow�) [9:103]�. Said Ibn 'Abbas: �They were ten men�."

In these verses the Generous Lord, the lovingly kind, the able, the pure-knowing knower, the one and unique in name and mark, divides MuḤammad's community into three groups according to the degrees of their faith, the disparity of their acts, and the difference of their character traits. This is the same classification that He provided in detail elsewhere: \" Among them are wrongdoers to themselves, among them are moderate, and among them are preceders in good deeds \" [35:32]. There He mentioned them together and here apart, but the classification and the ranking in terms of virtue are the same. First are the preceders, the first, and they are the preceders. Second are others who have acknowledged their sins, and they are the moderate. Third are others made to hope for God's command, and they are the wrongdoers. He begins with the preceders. In the beginningless they have the precedence of solicitude and the bounty of guidance from God. They are the first chieftains and the forebears of this commu- nity, the best of creation, the lamps of guidance, the signposts of the religion, the treasurers of the Real, the pillars of the submission, the masters of this world, the interceders of the next world, the chosen of mortal man, the boast of Adam's children. They are the Companions of MuṣṬafā and the chosen of God, the leaders of the submission and the Sunnah, the first in the religion and recogni- tion. They were the first to hear the Real's message and they were the first to accept the message- bringer and to welcome the Real. One group are the Emigrants. They left behind their homes and families and lost their means and homeland for God's sake. Another group are the Helpers, who accepted MuṣṬafā with heart and spirit and gave his companions refuge. As a bird nurtures its chick, they nurtured the submission. They made their bodies and spirits shields for the religion of the submission. They took this world as lowly and they placed their love in the religion. Another group are the Followers who came later: and those who followed them in beautiful doing."

He went there and prayed in that mosque.

This Abu 'Amir had embraced Christianity and became a monk in the pre-Islamic period. But when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, moved to Medina, Abu 'Amir rejected the religion of Islam and showed enmity toward it. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him then Abu 'Amir al-Fasiq (the corrupt) [instead of Abu 'Amir al-Rahib (the monk)]. Abu 'Amir left to Syria and then sent a letter to the hypocrites in which he wrote: 'Prepare yourselves and make ready whatever you can of force and weapons. Built a mosque for me, for I am going to the Caesar to request him to send with me Byzantine soldiers so that I drive out Muhammad and his Companions'. And so, they built for him a mosque by the Quba' mosque. Those who built this mosque were 12 men: Khidham ibn Khalid (this mosque of opposition was an extension of his house), Tha'labah ibn Hatib, Mu'attib ibn Qushayr, Abu Habibah ibn al-Az'ar, 'Abbad ibn Hunayf, Jariyah ibn 'Amir, his two sons Majma' and Zayd, Nabtal ibn Harith, Bahzaj ibn 'Uthman, Bijad ibn 'Uthman and Wadi'ah ibn Thabit. When they finished building this mosque, they went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'We have built a mosque for the sick and the needy and also for use in rainy and wintry nights, and we would like you to come and pray in it'."

      "text": "Surely God has bought from the faithful their souls and their possessions so that they may have the Garden.... So rejoice in your sale you have made to Him. In the tasting of the recognizers and the path of the elect, this verse is a place for the joy of the friends and a playing field for the secret cores of the sincerely truthful. It is felicitation for the faithful, a fitting felicitation and an appropriate bestowal of eminence. It is a felicitation that is the heart's intimacy and the spirit's message, the ornament of the session and the capital of the indigent, the adornment of tongues and the life of hearts. It is a generous felicitation, from a gen- erous Lord-generous in Essence, generous in attributes, generous in love, generous in caressing, generous in bestowal. The servant himself is bestowed by His bounty, and then He buys back what He Himself be- stowed. He makes the transaction, but He bestows all the profit on the servant and accepts the loss for Himself. This is beautiful doing and generosity, loving kindness and gentleness. In the Torah of Moses God said, \" The Garden is My Garden and the possessions My posses- sions. Buy My Garden with My possessions! If you profit, that is yours, and if you lose, that is Mine. O children of Adam, I did not create you to profit from you. I created you only so that you would profit from Me. \" In the Beginningless, before the servant's existence, the Lord of the Worlds bought him. He was the seller and the buyer. He Himself sold and He Himself bought. In the Shariah of MuṣṬafā, it is not permitted for the buyer and seller to be the same, unless it be a father, for whom it is permitted on condition of tenderness, negation of suspicion, perfect loving kindness, and fatherly love. What then do you say about someone who is more clement and merciful toward the servant than a father, a God whose loving kindness has no bounds and whose love is greater? Given that it is permitted for a father, it is more appropriate and more complete in the case of the loving Creator. Moreover, the Exalted Lord knew that the servants are bad-tempered, breakers of the Cov- enant, and disloyal to it."

These are the attributes of the faithful, the conduct of the familiar, and the custom of the friends, who are the hindmost in this world and the foremost in that world. They are the witnesses among the prophets and the interceders for the people, the masters of this world, the lovers of the religion and the beloved of the Real. In this verse their grades are mentioned in a pleasing arrangement. He praises them and bears witness to them, beginning with the lowest of them. First He mentions the lower ones, those who repent and turn back from sin, so that they will not stay ashamed and stricken in heart, but will have new hope. He is saying: \" The repenters, those who have turned back from sin, who apologize and are regretful; the worshipers, those who worship, observe the commands, and do service; the praisers, those who praise, extol, and laud; the journeyers, those who go on the hajj, keep the fast, and seek for knowl- edge; the bowers, those who are humble, who serve others, who obey the commands of a pir they have reached; the prostrators, those who say the prayer, who plead, and who put their faces in the dust for the sake of My majesty; the commanders to the honorable, those who command the people to the religion, who call out and invite to obedience, who give good counsel and advise each other; and prohibiters of the improper, the just sultans, those who call to remembrance and who bring the people away from evil and who receive them with spirit and heart. Give good news to the faithful! Give good news to the faithful that whatever shortcoming they may have, My unneediness is equal to it. Whatever may be displeasing from them, My loving kindness is on top of that. Whatever the servant may hope, My bounty is greater than that. Give good news to the faithful that when I chose them, I saw the faults. I did not approve before I had examined the hidden things. With My own unneediness I bought the servants as they are."

This is a command, a bestowal of eminence, and a felicitation: a command of God, a bestowal of eminence through good news, and a beautiful felicitation; a lovingly kind command, a heart- holding bestowal of eminence, a magnificent felicitation. He is commanding to bring the servants near to Himself, bestowing eminence so that the travelers will give their hearts to His love, giving felicitation so that they will seek His companionship. The servants who get the work done are those who have His love in their hearts. Those who reap the Real's fruit are those who have living hearts. Those who remember Him are those who receive eminence from the Real. They pass their days in the world with the world's folk like strangers. O you who have faith! This is a call of generosity and an infinite caress. The ears for the Real's call are the seven members of the body. When He discloses Himself, the sorrows of the two worlds are forgotten. He put the call of generosity in front so that hearing it, the servant would find it easy to carry the burden of the decree. What is the decree? \" Be wary of God and be among the truthful! \" He commands to godwariness, and He commands truthfulness in godwariness. Godwariness is the basis of the submission, truthfulness the perfection of faith. Godwariness is the beginning of familiarity, truthfulness the mark of love. Godwariness is the capital of the wor- shipers, truthfulness the mark of the light of recognition. Godwariness belongs to the travelers in the world of the Shariah, truthfulness belongs to the pain-stricken in the world of the Tariqah. When someone comes to possess the good fortune of godwariness and he is shown the beauty of truthful- ness, his mark is that he strikes fire into the hut of his own existence, launches the ship of createdness in the ocean of nonbeing, makes his children into orphans, bids farewell to his near ones and family, and cleanses his inwardness of habits and customs. His outwardness comes to be adorned with the light of the Shariah, his secret core filled with love for the Real, his heart emptied of love for this world, his secret core of desire for the afterworld-he has no joining with this world or the folk of this world, and no ease with the afterworld. Remembering the two worlds is no doubt to be pregnant. If you claim to be a man, do not be pregnant. You were good-do not be bad for the sake of talk. You were a man-do not be a woman for color and scent. [DS 326, 325]"

How can a mortal reach the forefront of the Real's acceptance such that He puts up with his disdain? By thy life! [15:72]. How can a mortal be worthy for the grasp of the attributes to explain the polish of his heart's mirror by virtue of solicitude? Did We not expand for thee thy breast? [94:1].

In the era of the Beginningless, when love was apportioned, the wail of separation's pain rose up from the house of Abū Jahl, and the glitter of union's sun shone from the chamber of MuḤammad the Arab. From that separation was created a hell in the heart of the estranged, and from this union was affirmed a paradise in the breast of the friends. After the sun of union shone on that paragon, the world's folk were bewildered in his work. The wish for his beauty and for following him rose up in the prophets. Moses the Speaking Com- panion said, \" Lord God, make me one of his community! \" Jesus the Spirit of God said, \" Lord God, make me the door-keeper of his threshold! \" [Abraham] the Bosom Friend said, \" Lord God, make my mention flow on the tongue of his community! \" More wonderful than all this is that the paragon himself became bewildered in the steps of his own path."

Thus, some people liked the command and hastened to execute it, while the wives, dependents and children of others hung on to some others, saying: 'We beseech you by Allah not to leave us to no one, causing our waste and peril'.

      "text": "God has already helped you in many homesteads, and on the Day of Hunain, when you admired your own multitude. Self-admiration is the ghoul of the road. It is the blight of the religion, the cause of the disappear- ance of blessings, the key to separation, and the basis of heedlessness. Self-admiration is that you consider your own obedience important, you consider yourself the source of your service, and you look upon your service with the eye of approval. By the decree of the reports and the fatwa of prophethood, the obedience of such a person will never go any further than his own head. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “O God, I am trying to avoid two claims, and from each I ask the help of Your bounty: fancying that I have something of my own, and fancying that I have a right- ful due against You. “O God, I have risen up from where I was, but I have not yet reached where I want to go. “O God, anyone who has not yet been killed by selflessness is a corpse. When someone's por- tion of friendship is talk, he has been defrauded. When someone's religion is not the road of spirit and heart, what business has he with the Friend?” MuṣṬafā said, “If you did not sin, I would be afraid that you would have something worse than sin: self-admiration! self-admiration!” He also said, “What a bad servant! A servant who imagines, becomes conceited, and forgets the Great, the Transcendent. What a bad servant! A servant who dominates, transgresses, and for- gets the All-Compelling, the Highest. What a bad servant! A servant who is negligent, inattentive, and forgets the tomb and disintegration. What a bad servant! A servant who is worried, oversteps, and forgets the beginning and the end.”"

Mu�awiyah was of the opinion that it was revealed about the people of the Book, while I said to him that it was revealed about them as well as about us. We had an altercation after which he wrote to �Uthman to complain about me. �Uthman wrote to me asking me to go to Medina. When I went to Medina, a lot of people came to see me, as if they had never seen me before. I mentioned this to �Uthman and he said: �If you wish you can move somewhere else and stay close�. This is what has brought me to this place. Had they appointed an Abyssinian slave as my leader, I would have heard and obeyed him� �. This was narrated by Bukhari from Qutaybah from Jarir from Husayn; he also narrated it from �Ali from Hushaym. The Commentators of the Qur�an also disagree about the occasion of this verse. Some are of the opinion that it was specifically revealed about the people of the Book. Al-Suddi thought it was revealed about the people of the Qiblah while al-Dahhak was of the opinion that it was about both the people of the Book and the Muslims. �Ata� also reported that Ibn �Abbas said regarding the words of Allah (They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah�): �He means of the believers�.

This happened at a time when people were living in straitened circumstances, the land was suffering from drought; it was very hot and it was time to reap the dates which were by then ripe. People found it very hard to conquer the Byzantines; they preferred to stay at home and enjoy the shade. The idea of going out to fight was very hard to accept.

O you whose heart has never for one day walked in poverty and who, in your whole life, have never for one hour sat like Jacob in poverty's house of sorrows! O you who have never for one day placed your own attributes with the description of poverty in the mangonel of struggle and never for an instant sacrificed your spirit in the cave of exile and the state of indigence by following the beloved Prophet and the sincerely truthful Abū Bakr. You suppose that without tasting the drink of poverty and wearing the clothes of discipline today you will dwell tomorrow in the domiciles of the High Chambers with the poor among the Companions and the men of the road of poverty. Your supposition is erroneous and your self-governance wrong. They were a thousand times more passionate about that poverty of theirs than you are about being a chief. ʿAbd al-RaḤmān ibn ʿAwf was one of the paragons among the Companions, but the beauty of poverty had hidden its face from him. One day he came in to the presence of MuṣṬafā, and Saʿd ibn Muʿādh, a poor Companion, was present. Words came forth from ʿAbd al-RaḤmān that made the poor man sad, and he became ill. Then ʿAbd al-RaḤmān made one-half of his wealth a sacrifice for the suf- fering of his heart, but he would not accept. God's Messenger said, \" O Saʿd, why will you not accept? \" He said, \" O Messenger of God! The pearl of poverty is too exalted to be sold even for the whole of this world. \" For a hundred years the sun must rise in the east and set in the west before the beginningless decree gives a recognizer the eyes to see the beauty of poverty and recognize the exaltedness of poverty. He must have a pain that makes him familiar with seeking. But this seeking is not like the seeking of other things. This pain is not like other pains, which arise from the vapor of forbidden morsels and appear at the top of the stomach. The pain of the religion and the vision of this seeking arise from the level of the liver of the free man, and the exaltedness of the poverty in the hearts of seekers appears in the measure of their pain."

By Allah, once we enter Medina, the mighty among us will drive out the lowly'. A Muslim man heard this and informed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. When he sent for 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, the latter swore by Allah that he did not say it. Allah, exalted is He, revealed this to give him the lie�. (And they purposed that which they could not attain�) [9:74]. Al-Dahhak said: �They were planning to push the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, off his mount on the night of the steep road. These were men who agreed to kill the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, while they were with him. They waited for an opportunity to take him by surprise. Their chance came when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was taking a steep road. Some of them came forward while others stayed behind. It was night time. They said to each other: 'Once he starts going down this steep road, we will push him off his mount into the ravine'. His guide that night was 'Ammar ibn Yasir and his navigator was Hudhayfah. When Hudhayfah heard the sound of camels' hoofs, he looked behind and saw veiled men. He shouted: 'Go away, go away, O enemies of Allah!' They stopped and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, proceeded to his destination. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (And they purposed that which they could not attain�)�."

Abu'l-Hasan Muhammad ibn al-Fadl informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr Muhammad ibn Ja'far ibn Matar\u003e Abu 'Imran Musa ibn Sahl al-Jawni\u003e Hisham ibn 'Ammar\u003e Muhammad ibn Shu'ayb\u003e Mu'adh ibn Rifa'ah al-Salami\u003e Abu 'Abd al-Malik 'Ali ibn Yazid\u003e al-Qasim ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\u003e Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: �One day Tha'labah ibn Hatib al-Ansari went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, pray that Allah provides me with wealth'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'Woe to you! A little for which you give thanks is better than plenty which you cannot bear'. Another time, he said to him: 'Do you not like to be like the Prophet of Allah. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, if I wanted mountains would flow with gold and silver for me'. Tha'labah said: 'By Him Who sent you with the truth, if you pray that Allah provides me with wealth, I will give each one his due'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then prayed: 'O Allah, give Tha'labah wealth!' Tha'labah then acquired some sheep and they multiplied like worms until Medina became too small to contain all his sheep. He left Medina and settled in one of its valleys. At that point, he only prayed Zuhr and 'Asr in congregation but not the other prescribed prayers. Then his sheep multiplied even more and he stopped praying in congregation altogether except for the Friday prayer. His sheep kept multiplying like worms until he finally stopped praying even the Friday prayer. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked about him and when they told him that his sheep had multiplied so much that he had to leave Medina and stopped praying in congregation, he said: 'Woe unto Tha'labah', he said it thrice. Then Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed (Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them) [9:103] and He also revealed the obligation of Zakah. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent two men, one from Juhaynah and one from Banu Salim, to collect Zakat, and wrote for them instructions how to collect it."

      "text": "(Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly�) [9:79]. Sa'id ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja'far informed us\u003e Abu 'Ali al-Faqih\u003e Abu 'Ali Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Maliki\u003e Abu Musa Muhammad ibn al-Muthanna\u003e Abu'l-Nu'man al-Hakam ibn 'Abd Allah al-'Ijli\u003e Shu'bah\u003e Salman\u003e Abu Wa'il\u003e Abu Mas'ud who said: �When the verses of alms were revealed, we used to ask to carry people stuff in exchange for a wage so that we could earn and pay alms from what we had earned. A man came and gave a lot for alms, some people commented: 'He is just showing off'. Another man came and gave a measure (sa') for alms, and they commented: 'Allah can do without the measure of this man', and so Allah revealed (Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours�)�. This is narrated by Bukhari from Abu Qudamah 'Ubayd Allah ibn Sa'id\u003e\u003e Abu Nu'man. Qatadah and others said: �The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, encouraged people to give alms. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf took with him four thousand silver coins and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, all my wealth consists of eight thousand silver coins, I have kept half of it for my dependents and brought the other half for you to spend it in the way of Allah'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'may Allah bless you for that which you have given and for that which you have withheld'. Allah did indeed bless the wealth of 'Abd al-Rahman to the extent that when he died he was survived by two wives who inherited one eighth of his fortune. This one eighth was estimated at 160 thousand silver coins. On the same day, 'Asim ibn 'Adiyy ibn al-'Ajlan gave to charity one hundred wasq of dates while Abu 'Aqil al-Ansari gave one sa' of dates. Abu 'Aqil said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I spent the night drawing water with a rope until I earned two measures (sa') of dates; I kept one for my family and brought the other'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded him to spread it among the received alms. The hypocrites defamed 'Abd al-Rahman and 'Asim, saying ''Abd al-Rahman and 'Asim gave alms only to show off. Allah and His Messenger can indeed do without the measure (sa') of Abu 'Aqil; he only wished to appear righteous'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse�."

Isma'il ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad al-Wa'iz informed us through dictation\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Nasr\u003e Yusuf ibn 'Asim al-Razi\u003e al-'Abbas ibn al-Walid al-Narsi\u003e Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan\u003e 'Ubayd Allah ibn 'Umar\u003e Nafi'\u003e Ibn 'Umar who said: �When 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy died, his son went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'Give me your gown to use as a shroud for my father, perform the prayer of the dead on him and seek forgiveness for him'. The Prophet gave him his gown and then said: 'Inform me [when you are ready to bury him] so that I may perform the prayer of the dead on him'. When he was informed and He was about to perform the prayer, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab pulled him and said: 'Did Allah not forbid praying on the hypocrites?' The Prophet said: 'I have been given the choice to seek forgiveness for them or not to seek it', and so he performed the prayer of the dead on him. Then this verse was revealed (And never (O Muhammad) pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his grave) upon which he stopped praying on them�. This was narrated by Bukhari from Musaddid and by Muslim from Abu Qudamah 'Ubayd Allah ibn Sa'id, and both Musaddid and 'Ubayd Allah ibn Sa'id related it from Yahya ibn Sa'id. Isma'il ibn Ibrahim al-Nasrabadhi informed us\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Malik al-Qati'i\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e Ya'qub\u003e\u003e ibn Ibrahim ibn Sa'd\u003e his father\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e 'Ubayd Allah ibn 'Abd Allah ibn 'Utbah ibn Mas'ud\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: �I heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattab saying: 'When 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy died, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was called to pray on him. When he stood up in front of the body to perform the prayer, I moved around until I stood close to his chest and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, will you pray on the enemy of Allah 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy who said such-and-such on such a day and such-and-such on such a day', and he counted all the things he had said, all while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, kept smiling."
