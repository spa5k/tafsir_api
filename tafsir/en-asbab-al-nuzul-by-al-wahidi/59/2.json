  "text": "(All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah\ufffd Allah is Able to do all things) [59:1-6]. The commentators of the Qur'an said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Banu'l-Nadir. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, moved to Medina, they signed a treaty with him in which they agreed not fight against him or with him and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, consented. Then when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, defeated the idolaters at Badr, Banu'l-Nadir said: 'By Allah, he is the Prophet whose description we find in the Torah; he will not be defeated'. However, when the Muslims were defeated at Uhud, they broke their pledge and showed enmity toward the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Muslims. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, surrounded them and then they signed a settlement treaty in which it was agreed that they leave Medina\ufffd. Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn al-Fadl al-Tajir\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e 'Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma'mar\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e Ibn Ka'b ibn Malik\u003e one of the Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who related that the unbelievers of Quraysh wrote the following to the Jews after the Battle of Badr: \ufffdYou are people of armaments and fortresses. Verily, you either fight our man or we shall do this and that, such that nothing will prevent us from the bracelets on your women's anklets\ufffd. When their letter reached the Jews, the Banu'l-Nadir were unanimously in favour of treason. They sent to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, saying: \ufffdCome with thirty of your men and we will send thirty of our men. Let us meet in a location halfway between you and us so that our men hear you and if they believe in you, we will all believe in you\ufffd. However, when they reached a certain location, some Jews said: \ufffdHow are you going to get to him when he has with him thirty of his Companions who all desire to die before him? Send to him and say: 'How are we going to understand [what you are going to say to us] when there are sixty of us? Come along with three of your Companions and three of our scholars will meet you."
