  "text": "(Those who entered the city and the faith before them\ufffd) [59:9]. Ja\ufffdfar ibn Burqan related that Yazid al-Asamm said: \ufffdThe Helpers said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, divide the land into two equal halves between us and the Emigrants\ufffd. He said: \ufffdNo, they will suffice you their livelihood. Instead you will share the fruits of the land with them while keeping the land itself to yourselves\ufffd. They said: \ufffdWe accept\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Those who entered the city and the faith before them\ufffd)\ufffd. (\ufffd but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot\ufffd) [59:9]. Sa\ufffdid ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar al-Mu\ufffdadhdhin informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli al-Faqih\u003e Muhammad ibn Mansur ibn Abi al-Jahm al-Sabi\ufffdi\u003e Nasr ibn \ufffdAli al-Jahdami\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Dawud\u003e Fudayl ibn Ghazwan\u003e Abu Hazim\u003e Abu Hurayrah who related that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entrusted one of the folk of the Platform (al-Suffah) to a man from the Helpers. The latter took the former to his family and asked his wife: \ufffdDo we have anything [to feed him]?\ufffd She said: \ufffdWe do not have anything except the children\ufffds food\ufffd. He said: \ufffdPut them to sleep and then bring me the food. And when you put the food down, turn the lamp off\ufffd. She did as her husband requested. The Helper offered what he had to his guest. The following morning he took him back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdIndeed, the dwellers of the heavens are amazed at what you two have done\ufffd. This verse was then revealed (\ufffd but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot\ufffd). This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Musaddid\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Dawud, and also by Muslim\u003e Abu Kurayb\u003e Waki\ufffd, and both Ibn Dawud and Waki\ufffd related it from Fudayl ibn Ghazwan. Abu \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ishaq al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Hasan Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah al-Sulayti\u003e Abu\ufffdl-\ufffdAbbas ibn \ufffdIsa ibn Muhammad al-Marwazi\u003e al-Mustajir ibn al-Salt\u003e al-Qasim ibn al-Hakam al-\ufffdUrani\u003e \ufffdUbayd Allah ibn al-Walid\u003e Muharib ibn Dithar\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn \ufffdUmar who said: \ufffdOne of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was gifted a sheep\ufffds head. The man said [to himself]: \ufffdMy brother so-and-so is more in need of it than I\ufffd, and he sent it to him. This sheep\ufffds head was sent from one person to another \ufffd it was handled by seven households \ufffd until it returned to the first man who was gifted it in the first place. This verse (\ufffd but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot\ufffd), up to the end, was revealed about this\ufffd."
