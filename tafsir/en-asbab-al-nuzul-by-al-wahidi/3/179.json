  "text": "(It is not (the purpose) of Allah to leave you in your present state\ufffd) [3:179]. Al-Suddi reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdThe members of my community were shown to me in their forms, as they were shown to Adam, and I was informed about who would believe in me and who would disbelieve\ufffd. When the hypocrites heard this, they mocked him, saying: \ufffdMuhammad claims that he knows who would believe in him and who would not. Yet, we are in his midst and he does not know us\ufffd, and so Allah revealed this verse. Said al-Kalbi: \ufffdThe people of Quraysh said: \ufffdO Muhammad! You claim that whoever opposes you will go to hellfire and Allah would be angry with him whereas whoever believes in you will go to the Garden and Allah will be pleased with him. In that case, inform us about who would believe in you and who would not?\ufffd And as a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. And Abu\ufffdl-\ufffdAliyah said: \ufffdThe believers had asked about a sign by means of which they would differentiate between the believers and the hypocrites and so Allah. Exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
