Said al-Kalbi: \ufffdThis was revealed about Ka\ufffdb al-Ashraf, Malik ibn al-Dayf, Wahb ibn Yahudha, Zayd ibn Tabuh, Finhas ibn \ufffdAzura and Huyayy ibn Akhtab who went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdYou claim that Allah has sent you to us as a messenger and that He revealed a Scripture to you. Well, Allah has charged us in the Torah that we do not believe in any messenger who claims to have been sent by Allah until he brings us an offering which is devoured by fire. If you do that, we will believe in you\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He revealed this verse\ufffd."
