Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Hamdun\u003e Abu Hamid Ahmad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Abu'l-Yaman\u003e Shu'ayb\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik\u003e his father (one of three men whose repentance was accepted) who reported that Ka'b al-Ashraf, the Jew, was a poet who used his poetry to satirize the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and incite the disbelievers of Quraysh against him. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went to Medina, he wanted to be in good terms with all its people who were a mixture of Muslims, idolaters and Jews. The Jews and idolaters, however, used to harm him, and his Companions, a great deal. Allah, exalted is He, commanded his Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to endure their harm, and it is about them that He, exalted is He, revealed (and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the idolaters\ufffd). 'Amr ibn Abi 'Amr al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Makki\u003e Muhammad ibn Yusuf\u003e Muhammad ibn Isma'il Bukhari\u003e Abu'l-Yaman\u003e Shu'ayb\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr\u003e Usamah ibn Zayd who informed him that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, mounted a donkey once, using a Fadakian piece of velvet as a saddlecloth, and had Usamah ibn Zayd follow behind him. He was going to visit Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah who was ill, at the Banu'l-Harith ibn al-Khazraj. This was before the Battle of Badr. He passed by an assembly which included, among others, 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy. This was before the latter had accepted Islam. This assembly included a mixture of Muslims, Jews and idolaters, the worshippers of idols. 'Abd Allah ibn Rawahah was also in this assembly. When the cloud of dust, stirred by the movement of the beast, reached the assembly, 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy covered his nose with his cloak and said: \ufffdDo not cover us with dust\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, greeted them with the greeting of peace, stopped and climbed down his mount. He called them to Allah and recited to them some of the Qur'an."
