Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us\u003e Abu Muhammad ibn Hayyan\u003e Abu Yahya 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Asim\u003e Khalid and Dawud\u003e 'Ikrimah\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who reported that a man from the Helpers renounced his religion and joined the idolaters, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed (shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) up to His saying (Save those who afterward repent\ufffd) (3:89). His people sent him these verses and when they were read to him, he said: \ufffdBy Allah, my people are not telling a lie about the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, nor is the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, telling a lie about Allah. By Allah, I will believe all three\ufffd, and he went back repentant. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, accepted his repentance and let him be. Abu Bakr informed us\u003e Abu Muhammad\u003e Abu Yahya\u003e Sahl\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Za'idah\u003e Dawud ibn Abi Hind\u003e 'Ikrimah\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdA certain man from the Helpers renounced Islam and joined idolatry. He later regretted this and sent to his people to ask the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, whether his repentance would be accepted since he regrets his apostasy. Allah, exalted is He, revealed (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) until His saying (Save those who afterward repent). When the man's people sent him these verses, he came back and became Muslim\ufffd. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abu Hamid informed us\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Faqih\u003e Ahmad ibn Sayyar\u003e Musaddid ibn Musarhad\u003e Ja'far ibn Sulayman\u003e Hamid al-A'raj\u003e Mujahid who said: \ufffdAl-Harith ibn Suwayd was a Muslim. He was with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. But he later renounced Islam and joined his own people. Then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) up to His saying (Save those who afterward repent). A man from amongst his people took these verses and read them to him. Al-Harith said: 'By Allah, I know that you are truthful, and I know that the Messenger of Allah, Allah, bless him and give him peace, is more truthful than you, and Allah, exalted is He, is more truthful than all'. He went back, declared his Islam and became a good Muslim\ufffd."
