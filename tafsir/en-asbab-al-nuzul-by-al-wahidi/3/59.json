  "text": "(Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam\ufffd) [3:59]. The commentators of the Qur'an said: \ufffdThe delegation of Najran said to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace: 'Why do you insult Jesus?' He said: 'What did I say about him?' They said: 'You say that he is a servant'. He said: 'Indeed, he is the servant and messenger of Allah, as well as His word which He cast into the Virgin Mary'. They became angry and said: 'Have you ever seen a human being who was born without a father? If you are truthful, show us such a person'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Harithi informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far\u003e Sahl Abu Yahya al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e Yahya\u003e Waki'\u003e Mubarak\u003e al-Hasan who said: \ufffdTwo monks from Najran came to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he invited them to surrender to Allah. One of them said: 'We have surrendered to Allah before you'. He said: 'You lie! Three things prevent you from surrendering to Allah: your worship of the cross, eating pork and your claim that Allah has a son'. They said: 'Then who is the father of Jesus?' The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was not in the habit of giving hasty answers but waited for Allah's answer instead. Then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse (Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam\ufffd)\ufffd."
