  "text": "(And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah\ufffd) [3:199]. Said Jabir ibn \ufffdAbd Allah, Anas, Ibn \ufffdAbbas and Qatadah: \ufffdThis was revealed about the Negus. When the latter died, Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, about his death on the same day he died. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to his Companions: \ufffdGo out and perform the prayer of the dead on one of your brothers who died in a different land\ufffd. They asked him: \ufffdWho is he?\ufffd And he told them it was the Negus. Then the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went out to the Baqi\ufffd and all that was between Medina and the land of Abyssinia was revealed to him such that he saw the bed of the Negus. He performed the prayer of the dead, uttering the expression Allahu akbar [Allah is the greatest] four times, and requested forgiveness for him. He then told his Companions: \ufffdRequest forgiveness for him!\ufffd The hypocrites commented: \ufffdLook at this one, performing the prayer of the dead on a foreign Christian Abyssinian whom he has never seen and who does not even follow his religion\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu\ufffdl-Fadl Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Yusuf informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar ibn Matar (by dictation)\u003e Ja\ufffdfar ibn Muhammad ibn Sinan al-Wasiti\u003e Abu Hani\ufffd Muhammad ibn Bakkar al-Bahili\u003e al-Mu\ufffdtamir ibn Sulayman\u003e Humayd\u003e Anas who reported that the Prophet of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to his Companions: \ufffdGet up and perform the prayer of the dead on your brother the Negus\ufffd. Some of them said to others: \ufffdHe is asking us to pray on a non-believer from Abyssinia!\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah\ufffd). Mujahid, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd stated that this was revealed about all the believers of the people of the Book."
