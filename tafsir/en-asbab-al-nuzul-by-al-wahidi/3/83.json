Said ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdThe people of the two Scriptures [the Jews and the Christians] went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to settle a dispute regarding Abraham's religion, for one of these parties claimed that they had the best claim to his religion. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdNone of the parties has anything to do with the religion of Abraham\ufffd. But this statement angered both parties. They said: \ufffdBy Allah, we do not accept your judgement nor are we going to follow your religion!\ufffd Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Seek they other than the religion of Allah\ufffd)\ufffd."
