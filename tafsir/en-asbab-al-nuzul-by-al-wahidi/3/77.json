  "text": "(Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah\ufffds covenant and their oaths\ufffd) [3:77]. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qadi informed us\u003e Hajib ibn Ahmad\u003e Muhammad ibn Hammad\u003e Abu Mu\ufffdawiyah\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Shaqiq\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhoever makes an oath knowing well that he is lying in order to usurp the property of another Muslim, Allah will be angry with him when he meets Him\ufffd. Then al-Ash\ufffdath ibn Qays said: \ufffdBy Allah, this was revealed about me. There was a land between me and a Jew, but he denied that I was its owner. And so I took him to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who asked me: \ufffdDo you have a proof?\ufffd I said: \ufffdno!\ufffd He then asked the Jew: \ufffdWill you swear [that the land is yours]?\ufffd I said: O Messenger of Allah! If he swears that the land is his, I will lose my property. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah\ufffds covenant and their oaths\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from \ufffdAbdan from Abu Hamzah from al-A\ufffdmash. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mihrajani informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Zahid\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Qasim al-Baghawi\u003e Muhammad ibn Sulayman\u003e Salih ibn \ufffdUmar\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Shaqiq\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhoever lies in his oath in order to usurp a property, Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him\ufffd. \ufffdThen Allah, exalted is He, revealed: (Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah\ufffds covenant and their oaths\ufffd) up to the end of the verse. Al-Ash\ufffdath ibn Qays came and asked: \ufffdWhat is it that Abu \ufffdAbd al-Rahman is relating to you?\ufffd We said: \ufffdSuch-and-such\ufffd. He said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about me. I reported to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, a dispute that I had with another man and so he asked me: \ufffddo you have a proof\ufffd. I said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd He said: \ufffdThen the man should swear\ufffd. I said: \ufffdSo let him swear\ufffd. The Messenger, peace be upon him, said: \ufffdWhoever lies in his oath in order to usurp a property, Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him\ufffd."
