Abu Sa\ufffdd informed us\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Zimjari\u003e Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar ibn Malik\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e his father\u003e Husayn\u003e Hammad ibn Salamah\u003e Yunus\u003e al-Hasan who said: \ufffdThe two monks of Najran came to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he invited them to surrender to Allah. One of them said: \ufffdWe have surrendered to Allah before you\ufffd. He said: \ufffdYou lie! Three things prevent you from surrendering to Allah: your prostration before the cross, your claim that Allah has a son and your consumption of wine\ufffd. They said: \ufffdWhat do you say about Jesus?\ufffd The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer. But then this verse was revealed (This (which) We recite unto thee is a revelation and a wise reminder\ufffd Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam) up to Allah\ufffds saying (\ufffd say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons\ufffd). Then the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, challenged them to summon Allah\ufffds curse upon the one who is lying amongst them (Mula\ufffdanah). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went and brought al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Fatimah and all his family and children, peace be upon them. When the two Christians left, one of them said to the other: \ufffdConsent to pay the Jizyah and do not agree to summon Allah\ufffds curse on the liar\ufffd. They went back and said: \ufffdWe agree to pay the Jizyah and abstain from summoning Allah\ufffds curse on the liar\ufffd \ufffd. \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz informed us among that which he gave us permission to narrate from him\u003e Abu Hafs \ufffdUmar ibn Ahmad al-Wa\ufffdiz\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Sulayman ibn al-Ash\ufffdath\u003e Yahya ibn Hatim al-\ufffdAskari\u003e Bishr ibn Mihran\u003e Muhammad ibn Dinar\u003e Dawud ibn Abi Hind\u003e al-Sha\ufffdbi\u003e Jabir ibn \ufffdAbd Allah who said: \ufffdThe delegation of the people of Najran came to see the prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. The deputy chief and the master spoke with the Prophet and he invited them to surrender to Allah. They said: \ufffdWe have surrendered to Him before you\ufffd. He said: \ufffdYou lie! And if you wish I will inform you about that which prevents you from surrendering to Allah\ufffd."
