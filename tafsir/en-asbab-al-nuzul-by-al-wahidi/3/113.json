  "text": "(They are not all alike\ufffd) [3:113]. Ibn \ufffdAbbas and Muqatil said: \ufffdWhen \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Salam, Tha\ufffdlabah ibn Sa\ufffdyah, Usayd ibn Sa\ufffdyah, Asad ibn \ufffdUbayd and other Jews embraced Islam, the Jewish rabbis said: \ufffdOnly the evil amongst us believed in Muhammad, for had they been among our best they would not have abandoned the religion of their forefathers\ufffd. They also said to them: \ufffdYou incurred a great loss when you have exchanged the religion of your forefathers with another religion\ufffd. Allah then revealed this verse (They are not all alike)\ufffd. Said Ibn Mas\ufffdud: \ufffdThis was revealed regarding the nightfall prayer which is performed by the Muslims but not by the people of the Book\ufffd. Abu Sa\ufffdid Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Ghazi informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Hiri\u003e Ahmad ibn \ufffdAli ibn al-Muthanna\u003e Abu Khaythamah\u003e Hashim ibn al-Qasim\u003e Shayban\u003e \ufffdAsim\u003e Zirri\u003e Ibn Mas\ufffdud who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, delayed the time of the nightfall prayer. When he came out to lead the prayer, he found people waiting for the prayer. He said: \ufffdThere is no one among the adherents of other religions who is remembering Allah, exalted is He, at this hour except you\ufffd. And Allah, exalted is He, revealed these verses (They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season\ufffd) up to His saying (Allah is Aware of those who ward off (evil)) [3:115]\ufffd. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Nuh informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli ibn Ahmad al-Faqih\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Musayyab\u003e Yunus ibn \ufffdAbd al-A\ufffdla\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Wahb\u003e Yahya ibn Ayyub\u003e Ibn Zahr\u003e Sulayman\u003e Zirr ibn Hubaysh\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mas\ufffdud who said: \ufffdOne night, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not come out. He was at one of his relatives or wives. He did not come to us to lead the night prayer until one third of the night had elapsed. When he came and found some of us lying down and some praying, he gave us the good news, saying: \ufffdNone of the people of the book perform this prayer\ufffd. And the verse (They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season, falling prostrate (before Him)) was revealed\ufffd."
