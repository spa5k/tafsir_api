Al-Suddi said: \ufffdWhen the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, called the Jews to embrace Islam, al-Nu\ufffdman ibn Awfa said to him: \ufffdCome, O Muhammad, and let the rabbis judge between us\ufffd. He said: \ufffdLet the Scripture of Allah be judge between us\ufffd. They said: \ufffdNo! Let the rabbis judge\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. On the other hand, Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr and \ufffdIkrimah reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered in on a group of Jews in a Jewish place of study and called them to Allah. Nu\ufffdaym ibn \ufffdAmr and al-Harith ibn Zayd said to him: \ufffdO Muhammad, which religion are you on?\ufffd He said: \ufffdThe religion of Abraham\ufffd. They said: \ufffdBut Abraham was a Jew\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdIn that case, let us go to the Torah and let it judge between us\ufffd. They refused. And Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Said al-Kalbi: \ufffdThis was revealed about those who committed fornication in Khaybar and the Jews who asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, about the legal punishment of fornication\ufffd. The elaboration on this will come in Surah al-Ma\ufffdidah, Allah, exalted is He, willing\ufffd."
