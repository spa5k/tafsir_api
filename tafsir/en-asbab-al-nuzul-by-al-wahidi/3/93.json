Said Abu Rawq and al-Kalbi: \ufffdThis was revealed when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWe follow the religion of Abraham\ufffd. The Jews responded to this by saying: \ufffdHow can this be so when you eat the meat of camels and drink their milk\ufffd. He said: \ufffdThat was lawful for Abraham and so we make it lawful too\ufffd. The Jews said: \ufffdEverything that we take for unlawful today was unlawful to Noah and Abraham and so on and so forth until our time\ufffd. To refute them, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel\ufffd)\ufffd."
