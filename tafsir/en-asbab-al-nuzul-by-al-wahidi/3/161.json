Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mutawwa'i informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Hiri\u003e Abu Ya'la\u003e Abu 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar ibn Aban\u003e Ibn al-Mubarak\u003e Sharik\u003e Khusayf\u003e 'Ikrimah\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdSome red velvet acquired as booty from the idolaters at the Battle of Badr was unaccounted for, and some people said: 'Perhaps it is the Prophet, Allah, bless him and give him peace, who took it'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (It is not for any prophet to embezzle (an yaghulla)). Khusayf asked Sa'id ibn Jubayr: 'Is it (It is not for any prophet to be embezzled (an yughalla))?' He answered: 'No, he can be embezzled and even killed' \ufffd. Abu'l-Hasan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Najjar\u003e Abu'l-Qasim Sulayman ibn Ayyub al-Tabarani\u003e Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yazid al-Narsi\u003e Abu 'Amr Hafs ibn 'Umar al-Duri\u003e Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi\u003e Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala'\u003e Mujahid\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who used to object against anyone who read (It is not for any prophet to be embezzled (an yughalla)) and used to say: \ufffdHow could he not be embezzled when he used to be killed? Allah, exalted is He, says (\ufffd and slew the Prophets wrongfully\ufffd) [3:112]. Rather the hypocrites accused the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, of taking to himself some of the booty, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed (It is not for any prophet to embezzle (an yaghulla))\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Asfahani informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Ahmad al-Asfahani\u003e Abu Yahya al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e Waki'\u003e Salamah\u003e al-Dahhak who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent some men in a reconnaissance patrol and he acquired some booty which he distributed on people while denying those who went in that reconnaissance patrol. When the latter came they said: 'He has distributed the booty without apportioning anything for us', as a result of which this verse was revealed (It is not for any prophet to embezzle (an yaghulla)) which was read by al-Dahhak as an yaghalla\ufffd. Said Ibn 'Abbas according to the narration of al-Dahhak: \ufffdWhen the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, got possession of the booties of Hawazin at the Battle of Hunayn, one man cheated him by holding back a needle, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
