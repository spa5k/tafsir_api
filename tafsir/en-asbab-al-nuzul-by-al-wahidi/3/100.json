Abu \ufffdAmr al-Qantari informed me, among other things he gave me authorisation to relate from him\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Haddadi\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Khalid\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim\u003e al-Mu\ufffdammil ibn Isma\ufffdil\u003e Hammad ibn Yazid\u003e Ayyub\u003e \ufffdIkrimah who said: \ufffdThe two tribes of the Aws and Khazraj had fought each other in the pre-Islamic period and upon the advent of Islam, Allah, exalted is He, united their hearts and had peace with each other. One day, a Jew sat in an assembly of mixed people which belonged to the Aws and Khazraj. He recited some poetry which was composed by one of the tribes during their war against each other. Something stirred within the people of the other tribe, and so they said: \ufffdOur poet has said this and that about such-and-such a battle\ufffd. The others replied by saying: \ufffdAnd our poet has said this and that about such-and-such a battle\ufffd. Suddenly some of them said: \ufffdLet us start war all over again!\ufffd Those who belonged to the tribe of Aws cried: \ufffdO people of Aws!\ufffd and those who belonged to the tribe of Khazraj cried: \ufffdO people of Khazraj!\ufffd They all gathered up, took up arms and aligned themselves ready for to engage in battle. At this point, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went and stood between the two armies, read this verse and raised his voice in the process. When they heard his voice, they stopped talking and listened to him. When he finished his recitation, they all dropped their weapons and embraced one another, crying\ufffd. Said Zayd ibn Aslam: \ufffdShas ibn Qays, the Jew, was an old man who grew up in the pre-Islamic period. He was a great disbeliever. His hate for the Muslims was extreme and his resentful envy toward them was intense. One day, he passed by a group of Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, from the Aws and the Khazraj who were gathered in an assembly and talking, and was infuriated to see their unity, friendliness and reconciliation when they were enemies in the pre-Islamic period. He said: \ufffdThe people of Banu Qaylah have united in this land."
