  "text": "(Think not that those who exult in what they have given\ufffd) [3:188]. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja'far informed us\u003e Abu'l-Haytham al-Marwazi\u003e Muhammad ibn Yusuf\u003e Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari\u003e Sa'id ibn Abi Maryam\u003e Muhammad ibn Ja'far\u003e Zayd ibn Aslam\u003e 'Ata' ibn Yasar\u003e Abu Sa'id al-Khudri who related that a group of hypocrites were in the habit of failing to join the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, whenever he set off for a military expedition. But then they would come and apologize to him the moment he came back, swearing to him [about their sincerity] and wishing to be praised for that which they had not done. And so this verse (Think not that those who exult in what they have given\ufffd). This was narrated by Muslim\u003e al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Halwani\u003e Ibn Abi Maryam. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Shadhyani informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Daghuli\u003e Muhammad ibn Jahm\u003e Ja'far ibn 'Awf\u003e Hisham ibn Sa'id\u003e Zayd ibn Aslam who related that Marwan ibn al-Hakam was one day, whilst he was the governor of Medina, with Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, Zayd ibn Thabit and Rafi' ibn Khudayj. He asked: \ufffdO Abu Sa'id, regarding the saying of Allah, exalted is He, (Think not that those who exult in what they have given) and, by Allah, we do exult in what we give and like to be praised for what we have not done!\ufffd Abu Sa'id replied: \ufffdThis was not revealed about that. Rather, a group of people at the time of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, were in the habit of failing to join him and his Companions in military expeditions. Whenever a setback or something disliked befell the Muslims, they exulted in their failure to join them; but when something good happened to the Muslims, they liked to be praised for what they had not done\ufffd. Sa'id ibn Muhammad al-Zahid informed us\u003e Abu Sa'id ibn Hamdun\u003e Abu Hamid al-Sharqi\u003e Abu'l-Azhar\u003e 'Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e Ibn Abi Malikah\u003e 'Alqamah ibn Waqqas who informed him that Marwan said to his chamberlain, Rafi': \ufffdGo to Ibn 'Abbas and say to him: 'If everyone who exults in what he does and likes to be praised for what he has not done will be chastised, then we will all be chastised'."
