Abu Ishaq al-Tha\ufffdalibi informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Makhladi\u003e al-Mu\ufffdammil ibn al-Hasan ibn \ufffdIsa\u003e al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sabbah al-Za\ufffdfarani\u003e Hajjaj\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e Ya\ufffdla ibn Muslim\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdSome idolaters who had committed many murders and fornicated numerous times went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdWhat you say and call for is good, if only you could inform us whether there is any expiation for the things we have committed\ufffd. As a response, this verse was revealed (And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah) up to His words (Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful) [25:70]\ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim\u003e Ibrahim ibn Dinar\u003e Hajjaj. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Yahya al-Muzakki informed us\u003e his father\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi\u003e Ibrahim al-Hanzali and Muhammad ibn al-Sabbah\u003e Jarir\u003e Mansur and al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Abu Wa\ufffdil\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn Shurahbil\u003e Abu Maysarah\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Mas\ufffdud who said: \ufffdI asked the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace: \ufffdWhat is the greatest sin?\ufffd He said: \ufffdIt is to ascribe an equal to Allah when it is Him Who has created you\ufffd. I asked: \ufffdWhat comes after that?\ufffd he said: \ufffdIt is to kill your child for fear that he might compete with you over food\ufffd. I asked: \ufffdWhat comes after that?\ufffd he said: \ufffdIt is to commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed these verses to confirm his answers (And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery\ufffd)\ufffd.
