  "text": "(On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands\ufffd) [25:27]. \ufffdAta\ufffd al-Khurasani reported that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdUbayy ibn Khalaf used to go to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, keep his company and listen to his speech without believing in him. \ufffdUqbah ibn Abi Mu\ufffdayt, then, rebuked him for doing so, and so this verse was revealed about it\ufffd. Said al-Sha\ufffdbi: \ufffd \ufffdUqbah [ibn Abi Mu\ufffdayt] was a friend of Umayyah ibn Khalaf. When \ufffdUqbah embraced Islam, Umayyah said to him: \ufffdI do not want to ever see you if you follow Muhammad\ufffd. \ufffdUqbah disbelieved again and renounced Islam to please his friend, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Other commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdUbayy ibn Khalaf and \ufffdUqbah ibn Abi Mu\ufffdayt were allies. It was the habit of \ufffdUqbah, upon returning from a travel, to invite the nobles of his people to eat with him. \ufffdUqbah also used to keep the company of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. He returned one day from one of his travels, made some food and invited people and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to eat. When the food was placed before the invitees, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: \ufffdI will not eat your food until you bear witness that there is no deity except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah\ufffd. \ufffdUqbah said: \ufffdI bear witness that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\ufffd, upon which the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, ate from his food. Ubayy was absent on that occasion. But when he was informed of what had happened, he said to \ufffdUqbah: \ufffdYou have renounced the religion of your forefathers?\ufffd \ufffdUqbah said: \ufffdBy Allah, I did not. I had a man in my house who refused to eat my food unless I bore witness to him and I was ashamed to let him leave my house without him eating, and so I bore witness to him and he ate my food\ufffd. Ubayy said to him: \ufffdI will never be happy with you until you go to him, spit on his face and step on his neck\ufffd."
