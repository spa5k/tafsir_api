  "text": "(Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah\ufffd) [45:14]. \ufffdAta\ufffd related that Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdIt is to \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab specifically that this verse refers. By \ufffdthose who hope not for the days of Allah\ufffd the verse refers to \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy. What happened is that, upon the expedition of Banu\ufffdl-Mustaliq, the Muslims stopped by a well called al-Muraysi\ufffd. \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy sent his slave to get some water but he took too long. When he came back he asked him: \ufffdWhat has delayed you?\ufffd He said: \ufffdThe slave of \ufffdUmar stood at the aperture of the well and did not let anyone draw water until he filled up the water skins of the Prophet, Abu Bakr and his own master\ufffd. \ufffdAbd Allah exclaimed: \ufffdOur example and the example of these people is as the saying goes: Fatten your dog, it will bite you\ufffd. When \ufffdUmar Ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be well pleased with him, heard this, he seized his sword, intending to go and kill \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ubayy, but then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Ishaq al-Tha\ufffdalibi informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah\u003e Musa ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAli\u003e al-Hasan ibn \ufffdAlawayh\u003e Isma\ufffdil ibn \ufffdIsa al-\ufffdAttar\u003e Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Yashkuri\u003e Maymun ibn Mihran\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdWhen the verse (Who is he that will lend Allah a goodly loan\ufffd) [57:11] was revealed, a Jewish man in Medina by the name of Finhas said: \ufffdMuhammad's Lord is in need!\ufffd When \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab heard this, he got his sword and went looking for him [to kill him]. Gabriel, peace be upon him, went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said to him: \ufffdYour Lord says to you (Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah\ufffd)\ufffd. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdCertainly, by Him Who has sent you with the truth, anger will not show on my face!\ufffd \ufffd"
