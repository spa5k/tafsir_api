  "text": "(Say (unto mankind): Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent\ufffd) [17:110]. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdOne night in Mecca, The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, stood up for the night vigil prayer. He kept saying in his prostration: \ufffdO Beneficent, O Merciful!\ufffd And so the idolaters said: \ufffdMuhammad used to call unto one Allah; now he is calling unto two gods: Allah and the Beneficent. We do not know of anyone by the name of the Beneficent except the beneficent of al-Yamamah (meaning Musaylimah the liar)\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Said Maymun ibn Mihran: \ufffdAt the beginning of revelation, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give peace, used to write \ufffdIn Thy name, O Allah\ufffd until this verse was revealed (Lo! It is from Solomon, and lo, it is: In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful) [27:30], after which he always wrote \ufffdIn the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful\ufffd. The Arab idolaters then commented: \ufffdWe know this Merciful but who is the Beneficent?\ufffd As a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Said al-Dahhak: \ufffdThe people of the Book said to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace: \ufffdYou mention very little the Beneficent and yet Allah mentions this name in the Torah in abundance\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse as a response to them\ufffd. (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a way between) [17:110]. Abu \ufffdAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e his father\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muti\ufffd and Ahmad ibn Mani\ufffd\u003e Hushaym\u003e Abu Bishr\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said regarding the words of Allah, exalted is He (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein\ufffd): \ufffdThis verse was revealed while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was in hiding in Mecca. Whenever the unbelievers heard the Qur\ufffdan being recited, they reviled it and reviled the person who had brought it. Hence, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, said to His Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship) i.e. upon reciting the Qur\ufffdan in prayer, lest the idolaters hear it and revile the Qur\ufffdan, (nor yet silent therein) such that your Companions do not hear you, (but follow a way between)\ufffd."
