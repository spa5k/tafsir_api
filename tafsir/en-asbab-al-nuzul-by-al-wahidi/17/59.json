It was said to him: \ufffdIf you wish to wait for them until We may select people from them [to believe in you], or you can give them what they have asked for. But if they disbelieve after that, We will destroy them like We destroyed those before them\ufffd. He said: \ufffdNo, I would rather wait\ufffd. And so Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed this verse (Naught hindereth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied them\ufffd)\ufffd."
