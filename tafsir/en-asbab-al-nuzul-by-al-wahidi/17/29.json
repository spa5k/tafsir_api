Abu\ufffdl-Hasan Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn \ufffdAli ibn \ufffdImran informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli ibn Ahmad al-Faqih\u003e Abu \ufffdUbayd al-Qasim ibn Isma\ufffdil al-Mahamili\u003e Zakariyya ibn Yahya al-Darir\u003e Sulayman ibn Sulayman al-Juhani\u003e Qays ibn al-Rabi\ufffd\u003e Abu Ishaq\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Ahwas\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah who said: \ufffdA boy came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdMy mother asks you to give her this and that\ufffd. He said to him: \ufffdWe do not have anything today\ufffd. The boy said: \ufffdShe is asking you to give her your gown\ufffd. He took off his gown, gave it to him and remained in his house denuded. Allah, glorified and exalted is He, then revealed (And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening\ufffd)\ufffd. Said Jabir ibn \ufffdAbd Allah: \ufffdAs the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting with his Companions, a boy came to him and said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, my mother asks you for a gown\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not have any gown except the one he was wearing, and so he said to the boy: \ufffdThings turn up from time to time, so come back to us another time\ufffd. He went to his mother and informed her but she said to him: \ufffdTell him that my mother asks you for the gown you are wearing\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went inside his house, took off his gown and gave it to the boy and remained there naked. When Bilal called for the prayer, people waited for the Prophet, Allah bless him and give, to emerge and lead them in prayer but he did not come out. The Companions became worried. One of them entered in on him and found him naked. Allah, glorious and exalted is He, then revealed (And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening)\ufffd."
