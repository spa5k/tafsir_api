Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Ibn Abi \ufffdAsim\u003e Ibn Numayr\u003e Abu Mu\ufffdawiyah\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e \ufffdAlqamah\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah who said: \ufffdA man from the people of the Book went to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said to him: \ufffdO Abu\ufffdl-Qasim, did you not hear that Allah carries all created being on one finger, all the earth on one finger, all trees on one finger, all the soil on one finger and then says: I am the King?\ufffd The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, laughed so much that he molars showed. Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And they esteem not Allah as He hath the right to be esteemed...)\ufffd. This means that Allah, exalted is He, is able to hold the earth and all that is in it of created beings, trees and so as one of us is able to carry some things with his fingers. We have only been addressed in our usual speech so that we can understand. Do you not see that Allah, exalted is He, says (when the whole earth is His handful on the Day of Resurrection\ufffd), i.e. it is His handful by means of His power."
