Once, he remained in this state for a while and then turned toward the qiblah, raised his hands and said: \ufffdO Allah, give us more and do not take away from us; honour us and do not humiliate us; grant us and do not deprive us; prefer us and do not prefer anyone over us; make us pleased and be pleased with us\ufffd. Then he said: \ufffdTen verses have just been revealed to me; whoever practises them will enter the Garden\ufffd. He then read: (Successful indeed are the believers) up to the tenth verse\ufffd \ufffd. This was narrated by al-Hakim Abu \ufffdAbd Allah in his Sahih from Abu Bakr al-Qati'i from \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\u003e Ahmad ibn Hanbal from \ufffdAbd al-Razzaq."
