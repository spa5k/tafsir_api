Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdWhen Thumamah ibn Athal al-Hanafi was brought to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, as a prisoner and the latter embraced Islam, he set him free. Thumamah returned to al-Yamamah and prevented the people of Mecca from getting any provisions from al-Yamamah. Allah, exalted is He, sent upon Quraysh years of scarcity until they were forced to eat animal hair mixed with blood. Abu Sufyan went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdI beseech you by Allah and our ties of kinship; do you not claim that you have been sent a mercy unto the worlds\ufffd. He said: \ufffdIndeed!\ufffd Abu Sufyan said: \ufffdBut you have killed fathers with the sword and children with hunger\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
