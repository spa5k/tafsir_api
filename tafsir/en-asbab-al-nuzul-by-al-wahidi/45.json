      "text": "(Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah�) [45:14]. �Ata� related that Ibn �Abbas said: �It is to �Umar ibn al-Khattab specifically that this verse refers. By �those who hope not for the days of Allah� the verse refers to �Abd Allah ibn Ubayy. What happened is that, upon the expedition of Banu�l-Mustaliq, the Muslims stopped by a well called al-Muraysi�. �Abd Allah ibn Ubayy sent his slave to get some water but he took too long. When he came back he asked him: �What has delayed you?� He said: �The slave of �Umar stood at the aperture of the well and did not let anyone draw water until he filled up the water skins of the Prophet, Abu Bakr and his own master�. �Abd Allah exclaimed: �Our example and the example of these people is as the saying goes: Fatten your dog, it will bite you�. When �Umar Ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be well pleased with him, heard this, he seized his sword, intending to go and kill �Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, but then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse�. Abu Ishaq al-Tha�alibi informed us\u003e al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn �Abd Allah\u003e Musa ibn Muhammad ibn �Ali\u003e al-Hasan ibn �Alawayh\u003e Isma�il ibn �Isa al-�Attar\u003e Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Yashkuri\u003e Maymun ibn Mihran\u003e Ibn �Abbas who said: �When the verse (Who is he that will lend Allah a goodly loan�) [57:11] was revealed, a Jewish man in Medina by the name of Finhas said: �Muhammad's Lord is in need!� When �Umar ibn al-Khattab heard this, he got his sword and went looking for him [to kill him]. Gabriel, peace be upon him, went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said to him: �Your Lord says to you (Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah�)�. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: �Certainly, by Him Who has sent you with the truth, anger will not show on my face!� �"

      "text": "Then We set thee on a wide road of the command, so follow it, and do not follow the ca- prices of those who know not. In other words, “We singled you out for gentle favors, so recognize them. We set down paths for you, so follow them. We affirmed realities for you, so do not go outside of them and do not incline to follow others.”"

      "text": "Surely they will not make thee unneedy of God in anything. “If God desires a blessing for you, no one will prevent it, and if He desires a trial for you, no one will turn it away. So do not attach your reflection to any created thing and do not turn the attentive- ness of your mind to anything. Depend on your Lord and trust in Him.” “O paragon of the world, O master of Adam's children, O sun of felicity's sphere, O moon of mastery's heaven, O lodging of the world of knowledge, O pearl of the oyster of eminence, O embroidery on the garment of existence! We separated you out from the world's folk, we orphaned you from father and mother, and We brought out your family and relatives against you so that your heart would be free of all and be totally detached for obeying and serving Me. From the wide roads We made for you the road of the religion, and you call the world's folk to that road: Say: 'This is my path; I invite to God' [12:108]. “O paragon! On the night of the miʿrāj, We sat you down in the dome of proximity and scattered a hundred thousand gentle gifts on the head of your good fortune. We made the two worlds the dust beneath your feet and brought the celestial figures and the terrestrial center under the banner of your rulership. What We intended was to give you expansiveness on the carpet of intercession. As long as there is the story of the pain of the disobedient, you should lift it up to Us and apologize for it on their behalf: Take us not to task if we forget or make mistakes [2:286]. O MuḤammad! If tomorrow you ask Us for the two worlds and the world's folk, you will have asked only for the dust beneath your feet. And if We, through eternal gentleness, use the dust of those feet in the work of one of your servants, that is not far-fetched for Our perfection.” The collyrium of insight had been daubed on the eyes of the prophethood of that greatest of the prophets. He knew that dust should be a carrier of burdens, not headstrong, because dust is for carrying burdens, not for being headstrong. Do you not see how the Exalted Lord threatens and warns those who were headstrong and refractory:"

From whom will they gain the means of approach when the road to the means of approach has been blocked to them? Today the tree of despair has grown old for them, instances of abandonment have come forth, and the destructiveness of justice has brought forth the dust of wealth. Tomorrow the caller of justice will begin the shout of abandonment:"

      "text": "Today We forget you just as you forgot the encounter of this day of yours; your refuge is the Fire. Yes, I said that dust must carry burdens, not be headstrong. If a sultan should pick up a poor beggar from the middle of the road, take him before the throne of his good fortune, and dress him in a robe of elevation, the stipulation for the beggar is that he not forget himself and that he know his own worth. He must always keep that poverty and lack of honor before his eyes. It reached the ears of ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz that his son had a ring made, and then bought a stone worth one thousand dirhams and placed it in the ring. He wrote a letter to him: “My son, I hear that you have had a ring made, bought a stone worth one thousand dirhams, and placed it on the ring. If you want to please me, sell the stone, feed a thousand hungry people, and make a ring for yourself from a piece of silver. On it, engrave the words, 'May God have mercy on the man who knows his own worth!'” O chevalier! No garment fits the stature of earth better and more beautifully than the gar- ment of humility: “Anyone who has twice traveled the urinary canal should not be proud.” Greatness, magnificence, exaltedness, height, tremendousness, and splendor are the attributes of the Majestic Lord."

      "text": "And the difference of night and day, and the provision that God sends down from heaven whereby He brings the earth to life after its death, and the turning about of the winds, are signs for a people who use intelligence. He reminds the creatures of His blessings in creating water, wind, and rain and thereby making ready their daily provision. Then He says, “are signs for a people who use intelligence.” An in- telligent person is someone who ponders and reflects upon the signs. From the first sign [45:3], he will understand His power, and the requisite of power is fear, so he will fear His harshness and forcefulness. From the second sign [45:4], he will understand His gentleness, and the requisite of gentleness is hope, so his heart will attach itself to His generosity. From the third sign he will recognize His blessings, so he will undertake to give gratitude for them. First is the station of the fearful, second the station of the hopeful, and third the station of the grateful. In the station of gratitude, much unveiling and veiling occurs. When the Exalted Lord says, “the difference of night and day,” He is alluding to unveiling and veiling. Bright day is the likeness of unveiling, and dark night is the mark of the veil. The servant passes back and forth between these two states. In the state of unveiling he sees only the Beneficent. He does not become happy in blessings, nor does he become sorrowful in tribulation. He is so busy contemplating the Be- neficent that he does not attend to the blessings nor to the grief and tribulation. In this meaning they have sung, “If I distinguish between Your doing good or bad, I will be busy with the distinction, not You.” In the time of the veil, the contemplation of the Beneficent conceals itself from him. He turns all of his attention to blessings and tribulation. Hence in blessings he beats the drum of happiness, and in tribulation he carries the burden of grief. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “Pain and remedy, grief and happiness, poverty and wealth-these are all attributes of the wayfarers in the way stations of the road. When a man reaches the goal, he has no station or way station, no moment or state, no spirit or heart.” Make not your home in body or spirit, for that is low and this is high. Take a step outside of both-be not here and be not there. [DS 51] O God, sometimes I take joy in pain and make do with its increase, hoping that when I melt in this pain, I will overthrow both pain and comfort."
