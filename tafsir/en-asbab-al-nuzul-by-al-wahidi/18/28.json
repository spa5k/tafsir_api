The judge Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Hiri related to us by dictation in Dar al-Sunnah on Friday after prayer, in the months of the year 410 a.h.\u003e Abu'l-Hasan ibn 'Isa Ibn 'Abdawayh al-Hiri\u003e Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Bushanji\u003e al-Walid ibn 'Abd al-Malik ibn Musarrih al-Harrani\u003e Sulayman ibn 'Ata' al-Harrani\u003e Maslamah ibn 'Abd Allah al-Juhani\u003e his uncle Ibn Mashja'ah ibn Rub'i al-Juhani\u003e Salman al-Farisi who said: \ufffdThose whose hearts were to be reconciled (al-mu'allafati qulubuhum) - 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn, al-Aqra' ibn Habis and their families - came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, if only you could sit at the front of the assembly and remove these people - meaning: Salman al-Farisi, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and other poor Muslims - and their smelly outer garments - because the only thing they had on them were these woollen outer garments - from us, then we could sit with you, talk to you and learn from you!' As a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him. Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His Countenance) [18:27-28] up to His words (Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire...) [18:29], threatening them with hell. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, stood up and went looking for them. He found them at the back of the mosque making remembrance of Allah, exalted is He. He said: 'Praise be to Allah Who did not take away my soul until He commanded me to restrain myself with men of my community. It is with you that I live and with you that I die' \ufffd. (\ufffdand obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance\ufffd) [18:28]. Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us\u003e Abu'l-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Abu Yahya al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e Abu Malik\u003e Juwaybir\u003e al-Dahhak\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding the words of Allah, exalted is He (\ufffdand obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance\ufffd): \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Umayyah ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi. He asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to do something that he disliked. He asked him to chase away the poor from his assembly and draw to him, instead, the leaders of Mecca. Allah, exalted is He, revealed (\ufffdand obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance), i.e. sealed his heart such that he will never believe in Allah's divine oneness (who followeth his own lust) i.e. idolatry\ufffd."
