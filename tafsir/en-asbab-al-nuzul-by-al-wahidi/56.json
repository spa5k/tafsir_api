It is the attribute of wage-earners who do the work and want the wage. But God has friends who do not bow their heads to the paradise of His approval, nor do they hunt the maidens, castles, rivers, and trees. They are servants at the house of the Sultan of tawḤīd, the residents of the world of love, the sultans of the realm of recognition, yearning for the wine of nonbeing. The Paradise of Everlastingness presents its adornment and beauty to them, and they dis- close their certainty and recognition to it. Paradise presents its rivers of wine, milk, and honey to them, and they disclose the springs of tawḤīd and the oceans of solitariness to it. Paradise presents its trees full of fruits with their flowers and blossoms to them, and they disclose the green shoots of pain and bewilderment to it. Paradise presents to them the wide-eyed maidens, adorned and trimmed, and they disclose to it the veiled virgins of recognition and the hidden secrets of witnessing. Finally, paradise turns away from them in shame, and they pass on to the seat of truthfulness, at an Omnipotent King [54:55]. They do not open the eyes of their aspira- tion toward anyone."

      "text": "(And make denial thereof your livelihood?) [56:82]. Sa'id ibn Muhammad al-Mu'adhdhin informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Hamdun\u003e Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz\u003e Hamdan al-Sulami\u003e al-Nadr ibn Muhammad\u003e 'Ikrimah ibn 'Ammar\u003e Abu Zumayl\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: �People were once blessed with rain at the time of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'Some people have woken up this morning as grateful people while others have woken up as disbelievers. The former said: This is a blessing sent by Allah, exalted is He, while the latter said: the prediction based on such-and-such a star has been fulfilled'. The following verse was then revealed (Nay, I swear by the places of the stars) [56:75] up to His words (And make denial thereof your livelihood?)�. This is narrated by Muslim from 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-'Azim from al-Nadr ibn Muhammad. It was also reported that once the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, travelled and after traversing a distance camped at a certain place. People were very thirsty but they had no water to drink. They mentioned this to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he said: �What if I made a prayer and you were given rain, would you say that we were given rain thanks to such-and-such a star?� They said: �O Messenger of Allah, this is not the time of stars�. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, prayed two units of prayer and made supplications to Allah, glorified and blessed is He. The wind erupted and clouds appeared. Rain then poured down so much so that streams of water run down the valleys. People filled their water containers. But then the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, passed by a man who was using a goblet to ladle water. The man was saying: �We were given rain thanks to such-and-such a star�, and failed to say: �This is the sustenance of Allah, glorified is He�. Allah, glory be to Him, revealed (And make denial thereof your livelihood?). Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn 'Umar al-Zahid informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Jizi\u003e al-Hasan ibn Sufyan\u003e Harmalah ibn Yahya and 'Amr ibn Sawwad al-Sarkhi\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Wahb\u003e Yunus ibn Yazid\u003e Ibn Shihab\u003e 'Ubayd Allah ibn 'Ubayd Allah ibn 'Utbah\u003e Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: �Have you not heard what your Lord has said? He said: 'I have not blessed My slaves with any bounty except that some of them were ungrateful. They say: The stars did this and we were given it thanks to the stars!' � This was narrated by Muslim from Harmalah and 'Amr ibn Sawwad."
