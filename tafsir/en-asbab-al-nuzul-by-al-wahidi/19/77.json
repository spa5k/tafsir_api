Abu Ishaq al-Tha'alibi informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Humayd\u003e Makki ibn 'Abdan\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Hashim\u003e Abu Mu'awiyah\u003e al-A'mash\u003e Abu'l-Duha\u003e Masruq\u003e Khabbab ibn al-Aratt who said: \ufffdI had a debt with al-'As ibn Wa'il and I went to settle it with him. He said: 'By Allah, I will not pay you until you disbelieve in Muhammad'. I said: 'No, by Allah, I will not disbelieve in Muhammad until you die and be resurrected'. He said: 'In that case, when I die and am resurrected I will have children and wealth and I will be able to pay you'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Zahid\u003e al-Baghawi\u003e Abu Khaythamah\u003e 'Ali ibn Muslim\u003e Waki'\u003e al-A'mash Abu'l-Duha\u003e Masruq\u003e Khabbab who said: \ufffdI used to be a blacksmith and I had an unpaid debt with al-'As ibn Wa'il and so I went to him to ask for it to be paid. He said to me: 'I will not pay you until you disbelieve in Muhammad, peace be upon him'. I said: 'I will not disbelieve in him until you die and be resurrected'. He said: 'Will I be resurrected after death? In that case, I will pay you back when I return to my wealth [after the resurrection]'. This verse was then revealed (Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children?)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from al-Humaydi from Sufyan and also by Muslim from al-Ashajj from Waki'; both Waki' and Sufyan related it from al-A'mash. Al-Kalbi and Muqatil said: \ufffdKhabbab ibn al-Aratt used to be a blacksmith working for al-'As ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi who used to delay his payment. One day, Khabbab went to him to ask him for his payment when al-'As said to him: 'I do not have anything today to pay you with'. Khabbab said: 'I am not leaving until you pay me'. Al-'As retorted: 'O Khabbab, what is wrong with you? You did not use to be like this; you used to ask nicely for your payment'. Khabbab said: 'That was because I was following your religion, as for now I have a different religion: I follow Islam'. Al-'As said: 'Do you not claim that there is gold, silver and silk in the Garden?' Khabbab said: 'Indeed!' Al-'As said: 'Then wait for me until I pay you in the Garden', he said this mockingly 'by Allah, if what you say is true, I will have a better share of it than you', and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations) meaning: al-'As\ufffd."
