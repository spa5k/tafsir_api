Isma'il ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Hamawayh informed us\u003e Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ma'mar al-Shami\u003e Ishaq ibn Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Rus'ani\u003e his grandfather\u003e al-Mughirah\u003e 'Umar ibn Dharr\u003e his father\u003e Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said [to Gabriel, peace be upon him]: 'O Gabriel, what prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?' And so this verse was revealed (We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful). This was a response to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Abi Nu'aym from 'Umar ibn Dharr. Mujahid said: \ufffdThe angel [Gabriel] took quite a while to come to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. When he finally came to him he said: 'Did I take too long to come to you?' The Prophet said he did, upon which the angel said: 'Why should I not delay my coming when you [the community of the believers] do not polish your teeth by using small sticks (siwak), do not cut your nails and do not clean the joints of your fingers'. And then he added (We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord\ufffd)\ufffd. 'Ikrimah, al-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil and al-Kalbi said: \ufffdGabriel, peace be upon him, failed to come to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, when his people asked him about the people of the Cave, Dhu'l-Qarnayn and the Spirit. He did not know what to answer them and was hoping that Gabriel, peace be upon him, would come to him with an answer. When his coming was delayed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was very aggrieved. When Gabriel, peace be upon him, finally came, the Prophet said to him: 'You delayed your coming so much that I had some misgivings, and I have missed you'. Gabriel, peace be upon him, said: 'I have missed you more but I am only a slave who obeys orders. When I am sent, I come; and when I am kept back, I remain where I am kept'. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord\ufffd)\ufffd."
