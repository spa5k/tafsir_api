Muhammad ibn Ja\ufffdfar informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Daghuli\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Muhammad ibn Kathir al-San\ufffdani\u003e al-Awza\ufffdi\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Kathir\u003e Abu Salamah\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Salam who said: \ufffdWe sat \ufffd a group of Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace \ufffd and reminded each other. We said: \ufffdIf only we knew the most beloved works to Allah, glorified and exalted is He, for we would then perform them\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, therefore, revealed (Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure) [61:4] up to the end of the Surah. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, read it to us\ufffd. (O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not?) [61:2-4]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdSome Muslims used to say: \ufffdIf we knew the most beloved works to Allah, exalted is He, we would spend our wealth and persons in their sake\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, directed them to the most beloved works to Him, saying (Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure\ufffd) But when Muslims were tested at the Battle of Uhud, they retreated, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not?)\ufffd."
