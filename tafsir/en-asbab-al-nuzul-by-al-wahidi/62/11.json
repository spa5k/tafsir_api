  "text": "(But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it\ufffd) [62:11]. Master Abu Tahir al-Ziyadi informed us\u003e Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Ibrahim\u003e Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Warah\u003e al-Hasan ibn 'Atiyyah\u003e Isra'il\u003e Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\u003e Abu Sufyan\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was standing, delivering a sermon one Friday, when a caravan arrived from Syria. People left the mosque and went out to attend to it; only twelve people remained seated. Allah, glorified and exalted is He, then revealed (But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and leave thee standing)\ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari\u003e Hafs ibn 'Umar\u003e Khalid ibn 'Abd Allah\u003e Husayn. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Abu Bakr ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yahya al-Talhi\u003e Ja'far ibn Ahmad ibn 'Imran al-Shashi\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yunus\u003e 'Abthar ibn al-Qasim\u003e Husayn\u003e Salim ibn Abi al-Ja'd\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah: \ufffdIt was Friday and we were with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, when a caravan transporting food passed by. Except for twelve men, everyone left to attend to it, and so the verse of Friday (Ayat al-Jumu'ah) was revealed\ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim\u003e Jarir and also by al-Bukhari in Kitab al-Jumu'ah\u003e Mu'awiyah ibn 'Amr\u003e Za'idah; both Jariri and Ibn Za'idah related it from Husayn. The commentators of the Qur'an said: \ufffdThe people of Medina were suffering from hunger and a rise in prices. And it happened that Dihyah ibn Khalifah al-Kalbi arrived from a business trip to Syria. His arrival was announced to people by beating a drum while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was standing, delivering the Friday sermon. People left the mosque such that only twelve people remained inside, including Abu Bakr and 'Umar. This verse was then revealed, and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'By Him in Whose Hand is Muhammad's soul, had you followed each other, such that none of you remained, the valley would have inundated you with fire' \ufffd."
