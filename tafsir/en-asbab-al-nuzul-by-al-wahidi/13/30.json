The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah when they were about to write the document of the treaty. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to \ufffdAli: \ufffdWrite in the Name of Allah, the Beneficent (al-Rahman), the Merciful\ufffd. Sahl ibn \ufffdAmr and the idolaters said: \ufffdWe do not know anyone by the name of the beneficent (al-Rahman) except the ruler of al-Yamamah\ufffd, meaning Musaylimah the liar, \ufffdrather, write: in Your Name, O Allah!\ufffd This is how the people of the pre-Islamic period used to write. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about them this verse\ufffd. Said ibn \ufffdAbbas, according to the report of al-Dahhak: \ufffdThis was revealed about the unbelievers of Quraysh when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them (\ufffd Adore the Beneficent! They say; And what is the Beneficent? Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us?) [25:60], and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. He said (Say) to them, the Beneficent Whom you deny (He is my Lord; there is no god save Him\ufffd)\ufffd."
