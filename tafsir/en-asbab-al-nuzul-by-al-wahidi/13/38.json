Said al-Kalbi: \ufffdThe Jews insulted the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, saying: \ufffdThis man has no aspiration except for women and marriage. If he was really a prophet, as he claims to be, the matter of prophethood would have preoccupied him from women\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
