  "text": "(O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee\ufffd) [66:1]. Muhammad ibn Mansur al-Tusi informed us\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Umar ibn Mahdi\u003e al-Husayn ibn Isma'il al-Mahamili\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Shabib\u003e Ishaq ibn Muhammad\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar\u003e Abu'l-Nadr, the client of 'Umar ibn 'Abd Allah\u003e 'Ali ibn 'Abbas\u003e Ibn 'Abbas\u003e 'Umar who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered the house of Hafsah along with the mother of his son, Mariyah. When Hafsah found him with her [in an intimate moment], she said: 'Why did you bring her in my house? You did this to me, to the exception of all your wives, only because I am too insignificant to you'. He said to her: 'Do not mention this to 'A'ishah; she is forbidden for me [i.e. Mariyah] if I ever touch her'. Hafsah said: 'How could she be forbidden for you when she is your slave girl?' He swore to her that he will not touch her and then said: 'Do not mention this incident to anyone'. But she went ahead and informed 'A'ishah. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, decided not to go to his wives for a month. He stayed away from them twenty nine days when Allah, glorious and exalted is He, revealed (O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee, seeking to please thy wives?)\ufffd. Abu Ibrahim Isma'il ibn Ibrahim al-Wa'iz informed us\u003e Bishr ibn Ahmad ibn Bishr\u003e Ja'far ibn al-Hasan al-Firyabi\u003e Minjab ibn al-Harith\u003e 'Ali ibn Mushir\u003e Hisham ibn 'Urwah\u003e his father\u003e 'A'ishah who said: \ufffdThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to like sweet and honey. It was also his habit to go to his wives after finishing the 'Asr prayer. In one occasion he went to Hafsah bint 'Umar and stayed with her more than he usually did. When I found out about this, I enquired about the reason and I was told that a woman from her clan gifted her with a pot of honey which she offered to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. I said to myself: by Allah I will spoil it for him. I said to Sawdah bint Zam'ah: 'When he comes to your apartment and draws closer to you, say: O Messenger of Allah, did you eat Maghafir?' When he says: 'Hafsah fed me some honey', say: 'The bees which produced it must have eaten the 'Urfut'."
