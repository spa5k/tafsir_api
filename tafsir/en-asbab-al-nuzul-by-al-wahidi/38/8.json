  "text": "(Maketh he the gods One God? Lo! that is an astounding thing\ufffd) [38:5-11]. Abu\ufffdl-Qasim ibn Abi Nasr al-Khuza\ufffdi informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Hamdawayh\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Abi Darim al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdUthman in Abi Shaybah\u003e his father\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah al-Asdi\u003e Sufyan\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Yahya ibn \ufffdUmarah\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdWhen Abu Talib fell ill, the Quraysh and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went to visit him. There was, close to the head of Abu Talib, enough room for one man to sit, so Abu Jahl rushed to it to prevent the Prophet from sitting there. They complained to Abu Talib about the Prophet. Abu Talib said to the Prophet: \ufffdSon of my brother, what is it that you want from your own people?\ufffd He said: \ufffdO uncle, I want from them one word by means of which all the Arabs will surrender to them and all the non-Arabs will pay exemption tax to them\ufffd. \ufffdWhat is this word?\ufffd he asked. He said: \ufffdThere is no deity except Allah\ufffd. They all exclaimed: \ufffdDoes he make the gods One God?\ufffd The Qur\ufffdan was then revealed about them (Sad. By the renowned Qur\ufffdan, nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism\ufffd) up to Allah\ufffds words (This is naught but an invention) [38:1-7]\ufffd. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdWhen \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab embraced Islam, the Muslims were overjoyed while the Quraysh was devastated. Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah said to the nobles and chiefs of Quraysh: \ufffdGo to Abu Talib and say to him: you are our elder and chief and you know well what these fools have done. We have come to you so that you judge between us and your nephew\ufffd. Abu Talib sent for the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and when he answered his call, he said to him: \ufffdSon of my brother, these are your own people and they are asking you for fairness, so do not swerve completely from them\ufffd. The Prophet asked: \ufffdWhat do they want from me?\ufffd They said: \ufffdCease mentioning our deities and we will leave you alone with your God\ufffd. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them: \ufffdWill you grant me one word by means of which you will rule over the Arabs and subjugate the non-Arabs?\ufffd Abu Jahl said: \ufffdWe will surely grant it and grant you ten like it!\ufffd The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdSay: there is no deity except Allah!\ufffd The Quraysh were repelled and left, saying: \ufffdDoes he make the gods One God? How can One God be sufficient for the whole creation?\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about them these verses, up to His words (The folk of Noah before them denied (their messenger)\ufffd) [38:12]\ufffd."
