The Jews said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: \ufffdDo you not speak [directly] with Allah and look at Him as did Moses? This is if you are really a Prophet. We will never believe in you until you do that\ufffd. He said: \ufffdMoses did not look at Allah, exalted is He\ufffd. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse."
