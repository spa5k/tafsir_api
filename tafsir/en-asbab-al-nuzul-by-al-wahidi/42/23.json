Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdWhen the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, migrated to Medina, he went through periods of time when he faced needs and rights which he had to address but did not have the means to do so. The Helpers said: \ufffdAllah, exalted is He, has guided you through this man who is the son of your sister. He faces life\ufffds vicissitudes and has rights but does not have the means to fulfil them. Collect for him from your wealth that which will not hurt you and give it to him so that he uses it to help himself with the ups and downs of life\ufffd. They collected some wealth and took it to him. They said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, you are the son of our sister, and Allah, exalted is He, has guided us through you. Sometimes you go through ups and downs in life and you also have rights to address. But you do not have the means to face up to all of this. We thought to collect for you some of our wealth so that you can use it when you need it. Here it is\ufffd. This verse was then revealed\ufffd."
