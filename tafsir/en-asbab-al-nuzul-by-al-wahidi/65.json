      "text": "O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for the set period. This explains the ruling on divorce. Although the Shariah permits divorce, God hates it, for it is the cause of separation. MuṣṬafā said, “Among the permitted things most hateful to God is divorce.” He also said, “Take spouses and do not divorce, for the Throne shudders at divorce. Whenever a woman asks her husband for divorce, the ease of the Garden is forbidden to her.” He is saying, “Get married and do not seek divorce, for the Tremendous Throne trembles at divorce and separa- tion. Any woman who seeks divorce from her husband without his having harmed her or made her suffer will never smell the scent of the eight paradises.” Marriage is the cause of joining, and God loves union. Divorce is the cause of parting, and God hates separation. The wall of separation's world is affliction, and the water of separation's ocean is the bloody tears of remorse. The day of separation has no sun and the night of severance no day. If there were any drink more bitter than separation, it would have been placed on that rejected one of the Threshold, Iblis. A bowl was prepared of curses, the drink of severance and separation was poured into it, and it was put in his hand. He drank it all down, not leaving a drop. That was expressed like this: “Upon thee shall be My curse until the Day of Doom” [38:78]. The great ones of the religion have said that two goblets appeared from the Unseen. One was And he was one of the unbelievers [2:34] and the other was He is Ever-Merciful toward the faithful [33:43]. The cup of unbelief was full of the drink of separation and the cup of mercy full of the drink of union. He sent the cup of mercy on the hand of welcome with the escort of bounty to the spirit of MuṣṬafā the Arab. God says, “Surely God's bounty upon thee is magnificent” [4:113]. The cup of unbelief was given by the hand of justice with the description of abasement to Iblis the abandoned. It was said, “I shall surely fill Gehenna with thee and whosoever follows thee, all together” [38:85]. Rābiʿa ʿAdawī said, “Unbelief has the flavor of separation, and faith has the pleasure of union."

      "text": "(And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him, And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) [65:3]. This verse was revealed about 'Awf ibn Malik al-Ashja'i whose son was imprisoned by the idolaters. He went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and complained to him about his poverty, saying: �The enemy has imprisoned my son and his mother is very distressed, what do you advise me to do?� The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: �Be fearful of Allah and be patient. I also command you and your wife to often repeat 'there is no strength or might except by Allah' �. So he went home and said to his wife: �The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded both of us to often repeat 'there is no strength or might except by Allah' �. She said: �How good is that with which he has commanded us!� And they both started saying it straightaway. It happened that the enemy became distracted from their son and the latter led their sheep away and fled. He brought these sheep to his father; they were four thousand heads. This verse was revealed about this incident. 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn 'Abdan informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym\u003e Abu'l-Qasim al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Sakuni\u003e 'Ubayd ibn Kathir al-'Amiri\u003e 'Abbad ibn Ya'qub\u003e Yahya ibn Adam\u003e Isra'il\u003e 'Ammar ibn Mu'awiyah\u003e Salim ibn Abi al-Ja'd\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who said: �This verse (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him, And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) was revealed about a man from Ashja'. This man was poor but had numerous children. He went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and asked him for help. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, told him: 'Fear Allah and be patient!' The man went back to his companions and when they asked him about what the Prophet had given him, he said: 'He did not give me anything; he simply said: Fear Allah and be patient'. Not long after this, a son of this man, who had been captured by the enemy, brought him sheep. The man went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to ask him about what he should do with the sheep, and told him the full story. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: 'Keep them, they are yours' �."

      "text": "(And for such of your women as despair of menstruation�) [65:4]. Said Muqatil: �When the verse (Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart�), Kallad ibn al-Nu�man ibn Qays al-Ansari said: �O Messenger of Allah, what is the waiting period of the woman who does not menstruate and the woman who has not menstruated yet? And what is the waiting period of the pregnant woman?� And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse�. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri� informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn �Abd Allah ibn Hamdun\u003e Makki ibn �Abdan\u003e Abu�l-Azhar\u003e Asbat ibn Muhammad\u003e Mutarrif\u003e Abu �Uthman �Amr ibn Salim who said: �When the waiting period for divorced and widowed women was mentioned in Surah al-Baqarah, Ubayy ibn Ka�b said: �O Messenger of Allah, some women of Medina are saying: there are other women who have not been mentioned!� He asked him: �And who are they?� He said: �Those who are too young [such that they have not started menstruating yet], those who are too old [whose menstruation has stopped] and those who are pregnant�. And so this verse (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation�) was revealed�."
