In terms of allusion according to the tasting of the folk of recognition, this verse has another inti- mation. He is saying that in reality the faithful and the good men are those whom the Unity keeps under the domes of jealousy through the blessing of generosity. He nurtures them with the beauty of solicitude, He gives them access to recognition of Him, and He brings them close to companion- ship with Him so that they will become one for Him and estranged from other than Him. The Pir of the Tariqah said, \" TawḤīd is not just that you know Him to be one. True tawḤīd is that you be one for Him and estranged from other than Him. \" The beginning of solicitude is that He gives them a goal in the Unseen to take them away from the world. When they become solitary, they are worthy for union with the Solitary. Your seeker must be solitary like You- he must be free of every defect and pain. Until the diver cuts his heart away from the kingdom of life, it is not permissible for the hand of his seeking to reach the desired pearl. What then do you say about someone who, in seeking His majesty and beauty, aims for the greatest salvation? As long as he does not wash his hands of love for life, how will he reach union with the proximity of the Beloved? In the session of Moses a poor man let out a cry. In anger Moses shouted at him. At once Gabriel came: \" O Moses! God says, 'In your session, the owner of pain and possessor of heart was that one man. It was he who was present in your session for My sake. You shouted at him. Even though you are My speaking companion and My dear one, you do not see the secret that we have placed under a black blanket. It is yearning for My beauty that brings the friends into ecstasy. It is the demand for My beauty that pulls their hearts into the world of fear and hope, contraction and expansion. And God contracts and expands [2:245]. When the eyes are full of this world, they cannot hold the attribute of the afterworld.  When the attributes of the afterworld settle down in the eyes, they remain unaware of the majesty of My proximity and the exaltedness of My union. \" Not this world, not the afterworld-rather, union with the Patron! Ah, where is an aspiration not of this world? Where is a desire greater than the afterworld, a yearning to see the Patron? Where is a possessor of good fortune so that we may come out of the status of our mortal nature and grasp the stirrup of that possessor of good fortune-perhaps one day we will reach the Desired. If you want to come out of the pit of status like a man, grab hold of the pearl-encrusted, musk-wafting chain. [DS 719] Their Lord will guide them through their faith. Wait till tomorrow at the Resurrection when the friends go forth by the light of recognition on the steed of obedience to the carpet of expansiveness. They will be delighted in the station of witnessing, group by group and company by company, just as God said: \" We shall muster the godwary to the All-Merciful in droves \" [19:85]. In each domi- cile that appears, a company of angels will come forth by virtue of the command, saying \" Peace, \" and giving them the good news of everlasting joy and bliss. This is why He says,"
